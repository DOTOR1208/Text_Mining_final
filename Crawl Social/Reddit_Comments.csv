They just stare at the flames like it's a damn campfire.,,Reddit

Yellow dog seems to be enjoying that fire a little too much,,Reddit

**Spicy** chew toy!,,Reddit
Wow - never thought a pet would be interested in anything like a battery or that they could cause a house fire.  Thankfully they appear to be safe.,,Reddit
"It‚Äôs amazing to see the dogs know this is a bad situation. They stood there and fretted over it, like a child would do.",,Reddit
he is NOT a good boy,,Reddit
What happened to the cat?  They are ok?,,Reddit
"Hey Chief, is the fire out?

Yep

What should I do?

I dunno, why don't you go break some windows.",,Reddit
"That is very much indeed, not, a good boy.",,Reddit
"I really want to get a dog but man, videos like these really make me think twice.",,Reddit
Amazing how slow the dog bed burned compared to that couch.  The shit in couches is often hella flamable.,,Reddit
"It's fairly impressive how slowly the mattress burns,  they must not have removed the tag",,Reddit
"That brief moment where they both just stand there watching it.

""We are literally three dogs and a cat. What the hell do we do about this?""",,Reddit
"My first reaction is ‚Äúwow the owners are dumb for leaving that where the dog could get it,‚Äù but then in thinking about it a little more, it would never occur to me either that a dog might grab one of those to chew on.",,Reddit
"Look at that little Dennis the menace at the end, wagging his tail and following the fireman like nothing happened!",,Reddit
My cat would never do this‚Ä¶just saying.,,Reddit
Kennels are magical if you‚Äôre not home.,,Reddit
Did the cat make it? Did not see it after it ran.,,Reddit
"Dreadful for the homeowners, but there's something almost cute about the way they stand and stare at the fire for a minute or two. ""Well, this is *new*"".

Personally I wouldn't blame the owners, or say the dogs should have been crated. Like this is a one in a million thing. Sometimes shit just happens.",,Reddit
Good boy barked at the fire! Done all he could,,Reddit
Would an insurance cover this?,,Reddit
Is the cat also safe?,,Reddit
How does a dog get their mouth on a bare lithium-ion battery? That should be in a garage or shed and definitely not in reach of a dog.,,Reddit
This is why you need cats that boop cups of water off tables,,Reddit
I am surprised barking at the fire did not extinguish it. /s,,Reddit
Everyone‚Äôs talking about the dogs but what about the cat? Did the cat get out?,,Reddit
This reminded me of how my Sims reacted to a house fire‚Ä¶ especially the way it‚Äôs fast forwarded,,Reddit
This is one of my worst fears. I move all remotes and battery operated things onto a shelf when I leave my dog alone because he has a something against battery operated things for some reason when he is left alone. Doesn‚Äôt go for anything else but if it uses a battery and he can get to it he will try to destroy it.,,Reddit
They can make fire now *Gasp they're evolving,,Reddit
I imagine the dogs staring at it was a lot like man when he first discovered fire,,Reddit
This is why I have cameras in my house that I check throughout the day,,Reddit
"Lithium ion battery made my dog untrainable and my house a mess, I'm suing!",,Reddit
im glad they srvived. i was about to throw my phone out the window,,Reddit
"That's a pretty strong argument for batteries that _aren't_ removable. Strong, but not perfect.",,Reddit
That's a horrible chew toy,,Reddit
Dogs are cute but a Pain in the ass,,Reddit
"Who's dumb idea was it to keep/ store batteries where the dog could get one? 

Even if it didn't start a fire, I am sure the stuff inside the battery isn't good for the dogs' health.",,Reddit
Made me wait in suspense far too long to learn the dogs were ok,,Reddit
"The dogs standing there staring at the fire like ""OMG, now do a flip!""",,Reddit
who the heck left it there,,Reddit
"First of all, why he chew freaking battery?",,Reddit
I think he was genuinely thinking how to I hide this from my owner lol,,Reddit
What‚Äôs the whole story here? How were authorities alerted of the fire? It seems like nobody was home? Or maybe there was and the video skipped that part?,,Reddit
Everyday I keep learning things to keep away once I get a dog,,Reddit
"I like how the cat ran away first, ducked for cover behind the couch, then made its escape. Quicker thinking than the dogs.",,Reddit
"Man, the story here is how well that fire-retardant material in the dog beds held up! That fire took forever to consume the dog beds; it was only when it skipped to the couch that things got real.",,Reddit
"Serious question, water would not put it out, right? Like for lithium you need a proper extinguisher?",,Reddit
He knows what he did.,,Reddit
"The culprit getting led away by the fire dept¬†at the end.¬†¬†
""We meed to talk to you about arson bud"" üòÇ",,Reddit
i hope the owners didn't blame the dog...,,Reddit
Well that's a new fear.,,Reddit
"You've got baby proofing for a reason, well, gotta dog proof your place too cause those loveable little assholes are just like kids and will get into anything they can find.",,Reddit
Noone noticed the black cat? I wonder if it managed to escape üòï,,Reddit
"All I could think was please, please, please save the pups!",,Reddit
Reason #7436 why I'll never get a dog,,Reddit
So glad I don‚Äôt have dogs anymore. Always destructive.,,Reddit
Thank fucking goodness for the end. I was so worried for those pups!,,Reddit
Another reason avoid useless pets.,,Reddit
I think we are missing the fact THE OWNER LEFT A LI-ON BATTERY WHERE THE PETS COULD GET TO IT. HOW IRRESPONSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,,Reddit
"Bro was just standing there watching, yelling for someone to save his bed.",,Reddit
"Omg I‚Äôm so glad the dogs are okay.

‚ÄúWe were just chilling on our beds and all of a sudden the bed just lit on fire, I swear!‚Äù",,Reddit
His bite was worse than his bark,,Reddit
Biggest reason I kennel my dog when I‚Äôm away. It has a door to the outside. I had my dog eat my passport and cash before a trip .,,Reddit
And he never chewed anything ever again‚Ä¶. Just kidding. He won't make that connection.,,Reddit
"The reporter say, fortunately, the dogs made it out, at that point they are staying out due to me, not having a house anymore because they preferred a different chewing toy",,Reddit
The one FD member just breaking glass,,Reddit
‚ÄúWhy iz no nomz when nomz-shaped?‚Äù,,Reddit
Guess im not getting dog any time soon if they can burn your apartment down,,Reddit
spicy bone! run!,,Reddit
"Now I understand why some people have cams looking inside their messy living room. Without the footage, who woulda known",,Reddit
Some dogs just want to watch the house burn.,,Reddit
The dog on the leash at the end made me think that the dog was under arrest for arson.,,Reddit
The owners are idiots. That's why you keep things up and away from your dogs.,,Reddit
That's why you get a cat.,,Reddit
i think reading my dog the manufacturer guidelines wont help..,,Reddit
"Oh man, I knew I shouldn't have bought a l-ion battery for my dog as a chew toy. He just likes it so much.",,Reddit
Come home from a hard day of work and find out your dog burnt your house down.,,Reddit
"I really fucking hope we find a way to make batteries that are not only better than the ones we have today, as battery tech has only minimally advanced since the creation of lithium-ion batteries, turns out it's really hard to store energy. But also, I really hope the next great leap forward in battery tech makes them less flammable. That may be too much to ask for, but I really hope so. Lithium-ion battery fires are insanely scary and dangerous.

Until science & engineering catches up, what we *really* need is fucking legislation that forces manufacturers to make (virtually) all products to have replaceable batteries. When Lithium-ion batteries sit too long they can swell, and if they get punctured they will start a fire. 

I absolutely go out of my way to avoid 95% of products that have lithium-ion batteries that I can't replace. In fact, I plan on buying a wireless headset soon, and the only one I am even considering is the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless from Steel Series because it is the only wireless headset on the market that actually has replaceable batteries.

Same thing with my mouse. I currently can't use a wired mouse, and I want a mouse with more buttons on it, so I searched around and found ones that take AA batteries instead of ones that have stupid unreplaceable lithium-ion batteries.

Even ignoring fire concerns, batteries wear over time and by their nature, deplete in charge. If I want to keep using my device without it plugged in, or just want to replace an old battery in a device I am likely spending a decent chunk of change on, I should be able to replace it as easily as possible.

I can't fucking wait until our government actually catches up and gives us good right to repair and consumer protection laws.",,Reddit
"Idk why crate training is being hated on in this thread, if you properly exercise your dog, or hire a dog walker to come while you're at work, being crated when alone is safe. A big enough crate will allow the dog to spin around and move a bit as well. Of course it's not ideal or perfect, but it will keep your dog safe. I've been a dog walker for people who've had to crate their dogs when working. Dog was fine and happy.",,Reddit
"Still, 10 out of 10 dog. Would pet",,Reddit
When they make those beds flame retardant they don't fuck about. That burned for ages before it really went up.,,Reddit
They saved the dogs but did they save the black cat?? Or did I miss them showing it??,,Reddit
I sure hope that the fire department gave a strong speech to the dog about chewing batteries.,,Reddit
Dog was outside at the end like ‚ÄúI have no idea what happened!‚Äù,,Reddit
Straight to dog jail,,Reddit
This really wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if battery disposal bins were placed in every store. I live just north of a small town and we have only one store that has a battery disposal bin and only then it‚Äôs labeled ‚Äúrechargeable battery bin‚Äù adding to more confusion‚Ä¶,,Reddit
Does insurance cover act of dog?,,Reddit
I can't watch this video. There was a neighborhood that went up in flames in the Los Angeles area yesterday and so many families lost all of their dogs. I couldn't imagine having that happen in my place with my dog.,,Reddit
"Dogs are OK.

"""I was just minding my business and then the mattress caught on fire.""",,Reddit
Glad to see the firefighters have the prime suspect in custody,,Reddit
"Kudos to the cushion makers, that thing took a lot of time to burn.",,Reddit
That‚Äôs terrible! It‚Äôs a stark reminder of how important it is to keep batteries and other hazardous items out of reach of pets. Hope everyone is safe and okay.,,Reddit
The woof is on fire!,,Reddit
"They're evolving, they made fire",,Reddit
Is this how primitive humans reacted when they first made fire?,,Reddit
This just proves that dogs cannot fight Liions.,,Reddit
Fake chews,,Reddit
Where the fuck was everybody else?,,Reddit
Is battery ok?,,Reddit
But there dogs were ok right?,,Reddit
Why tf do non approved chargers even exist?,,Reddit
I'm glad it was firefighters and not police. They would have shot the dogs,,Reddit
insurance be like ‚Äúsorry we dont cover pet damage‚Äù,,Reddit
looks there's a cat at 10 seconds in that also gets the fuck outta there,,Reddit
Who left the battery out?,,Reddit
"Man learned how to make fire through sticks rubbing, while dog learned it through batteries",,Reddit
Imagine explaining that to the insurance.....,,Reddit
Oh those poor babies,,Reddit
im just so happy they lived.,,Reddit
This is why I kennel my girl.  It only takes one fuck up for her to kill herself on accident.,,Reddit
I appreciate whoever edited this video together- making sure that we know the dogs made it out.,,Reddit
This is like watching a sim deal with a house fire...,,Reddit
Really shows how effective the flame retardants are before the fire final took off.,,Reddit
Idiots just stood there watching it burn ü§£,,Reddit
They were good dogs and used their best barks trying to put it out.,,Reddit
"That's crazy, so glad everyone made it out.",,Reddit
A pyromaniac's best friend,,Reddit
Does insurance cover something like that? It‚Äôs crazy,,Reddit
Why is there just a battery laying around for them to chew on?,,Reddit
Proof that pitbulls are indeed dangerous animals to keep as peta,,Reddit
All that barking but not one of them went to grab the extinguisher or call 911. Thats why im a cat person,,Reddit
Does insurance cover something like this,,Reddit
I‚Äôm glad the puppers made it out safely. I hope their humans are more careful about leaving harmful items where they can get them.,,Reddit
I got so worried they weren‚Äôt going to show the dogs were okay. I mean I hate that for the house and the people who lived there but the way my heart  eat for a minute,,Reddit
"And this is why my dog always gets crated while we're out of the house. Dogs can be wonderful companions, but they are absolute morons by human standards.",,Reddit
"https://youtu.be/HrQ7VMMHY0w?si=6CkYy7uR5cv8yyxO

There was a dog door and the dogs safely got out thru that door",,Reddit

Poor doggies. I‚Äôm glad they got out ok,,Reddit
I‚Äôm legit happy the dog is okay.,,Reddit
"Poor fur babies, they didn't mean to :(",,Reddit
This video finally convinced my girlfriend to stop leaving her portable charger in the bed where we sleep with our dog,,Reddit
"My dog did this but thankfully we were home. I was cooking and took a minute to figure out why the fire alarm was going out. Walk into the office and lo and behold: dog bed on fire!

I like how the dogs sit there and watch it burn instead of getting a fire extinguisher. These dogs need to do better.,,Reddit
I hope the dog enjoys his flight to yulin.,,Reddit
quick thinking dog called the fire department!,,Reddit

Caught my brothers dog doing this once‚Ä¶luckily I managed to take it from him before he punctured it,,Reddit
"I don't know what the outcome was here in terms of total damage to the wider property but it's a testament to fire retardant fabrics that the fire didn't grow quicker than it did, that mattress kept it contained longer than I'd have expected.

Good to see the doggos are ok!,,Reddit
So glad I don't have idiot animals that can ruin everything in an instant.,,Reddit
Idiot owners should never be allowed to have pets again.,,Reddit
So whose idea was it to leave such things in easy reach for the dogs? üíÄ,,Reddit
so the family was at home and awake while all this was happening?,,Reddit
Time to drop off old Sparky at the farm,,Reddit
pretty terrible pet owners to leave a battery pack out in accessible reach of a dog,,Reddit
"I bet all the cat people are eating this up lol 

""My CaT (insert basic ass name like mittens) WoUlDnT Do ThAt""",,Reddit
Dogs can really suck at times :(,,Reddit
So you are an irresponsible dow owner for not training them well AND an irresponsible drone owner who leaves batteries laying around. Karma is a bitch if you are.,,Reddit
What was the item it chewed on that had the battery,,Reddit

I literally just checked the comments to make sure the animals were okay. Glad they are okay,,Reddit
"Bosco, you‚Äôre so in trouble when mom gets home now‚Ä¶",,Reddit
does insurance cover this ? because this willl ruin your year.,,Reddit

One of My cats favorite place to cough up hairballs is my pc cable outlet. kinda scared if he does that again,,Reddit

I'm shocked that didn't spread faster,,Reddit
Does this get covered by insurance?,,Reddit
Dog discovers fire:,,Reddit
I knew owning pets can be expensive but damn...,,Reddit
"Wow, super curious now - dog is on leash. Do firefighters carry leashes around, knowing they'll be saving dogs? Or did he find it in the building?",,Reddit

Maybe we shouldn't power so many household items with small incendiary bombs. Especially when LiFePo4 exists,,Reddit
I can only think how our ancestors discovered fire via lightning,,Reddit
"I'm more worried about the homeowners. That's a lot of damage, burnt stuff. And the comments say insurance won't cover it either due to the ""act of dog"" clause. Having a house fire in this economy of all time is rough.",,Reddit
Interesting to see how long the dog beds held up before they gave up and got consumed in seconds. Probably some foam in there which I believe is usually done with some kind of flame retardant. If it was just a cigarette or a candle falling down it probably wouldn't have spread.,,Reddit
I can't imagine the creative way their insurance company is going to try and get out of this one. That breed of dog was not listed as being present within the premise in which case violates the terms of the policy. Dogs that chew lithium ion batteries are not covered.,,Reddit
"This might be a stupid question, but are cats strong enough to crack open a battery like this dog did? We don‚Äôt have dogs but we do have three cats. We don‚Äôt have a doggy door or anything so if there was a fire, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to get out. I‚Äôm not sure if cats are strong enough to cause this damage to a lithium battery though.",,Reddit
"Ahh, good ole Sparky.",,Reddit
Hopefully not an airsoft battery he charged up for the weekends,,Reddit
That was a pretty big battery pack too.  Like for an RC car or something.  Glad the pups were okay!,,Reddit

"Not surprised that the cat zipped out as soon as the fire started, but the dogs hung out to wag at the blazing dog bed.üòÑ",,Reddit
Bad boi. Don't do that again.,,Reddit
You can see the dog react before the battery goes off. That dog is clearly a paid actor. /s,,Reddit

That‚Äôs not a video I‚Äôd send to my insurance provider,,Reddit
Another W for cats,,Reddit

"Ffs, use crates. As long as there‚Äôs no confinement fear and you‚Äôre not gone more than 3-5 hours, it‚Äôs safer. At the very least, do it for dogs that chew/get into stuff.

I get that not everyone is ok with crates but this is the type of shit that can and will happen.",,Reddit

That room has a weird tv placement.,,Reddit
I wanted to get through the vid - I was worried about the pups. I hope those people sue the hell out of the manufacturer,,Reddit
I'm sure insurance will not pay again!,,Reddit
Huh. I get the feeling that the dog won't be doing any more chewing. Or breathing.,,Reddit
"Never call the fire department unless you absolutely have to. They give a fuck what they smash, scratch, dent, run over and smash again.

Wouldn't spraying directly inside the window work too? Is this a better method or was it just done to demonstrate this can be done?,,Reddit
Fires hate this one principle,,Reddit
Physics is fucking awesome.,,Reddit
"Bernoulli‚Äôs principle says fast moving air creates low pressure. By using a tool to make air move quickly, they created high pressure inside the window and low pressure outside. Air inside the window rushed out because fluids move from high to low pressure. Since fire needs air to burn, removing the air out the fire using Bernoulli‚Äôs principle (credit: chemisphere).",,Reddit
"Negative pressure removes the heat (and also some oxygen) enough for the fire to be somewhat exhausted? Two things a fire desires. 

Or? Can someone correct me or add on to what is going on here?",,Reddit
"As a firefighter, they aren't actually putting out the fire here. You use hydraulic ventilation (as we call it) only once the fire has been knocked down, or there is someone ready inside who needs visibility asap. What you're doing is pushing the smoke out of the house, but also pulling fresh air into the house. This can cause the fire to grow exponentially and get significantly hotter if not coordinated with the interior attack team.",,Reddit

The firefighters are using a pole with a hook at the end and a nozzle. They insert the hook into the building so that the nozzle is close to being flush with the outside of the window. When they pull the trigger to release the water, they use a cone setting on the nozzle, the water, being in that wide cone shape, is drawing out the oxygen inside the building, while at the same time preventing oxygen from entering into the building effectively extinguishing the flames.

"This same principle, is (in part) how Dyson achieves their cool blade-less fans.    

There is a rotating vortex in the base* that pushes air through slots along the edges of the oval ring (the part you see) and in doing so it creates a low pressure ~ that induces the air behind the pull through.  It‚Äôs called ***entrainment*** and by exploiting this aspect of Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle, Dyson can achieve up to 15 times the air flow of traditional fan blades!

"As a retired Professional Firefighter for 32 yrs , This is the first time I ever seen this used to possibly extinguish a fire. We used this when it was an interior fire. Ventilating the house by pointing the nozzle out the window from the inside. It worked very well.There is really only 2 options when fighting a structure fire. Offensive where you would enter the structure for S&R or Defensive where exposures are protected and then surround and drown the structure.

This looks like a training exercise. Worked pretty good!",,Reddit
I misread and though a school principal put out the fire,,Reddit
"This isn;t bernoullis principle in action. Is's a demionstration of entrainment ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment\_(hydrodynamics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(hydrodynamics))) . The spray of water droplets entrains air, draggin it along with it, creating a flow/pressure differential that disrupts the draft that had previously been sucking in through that window.

Bernoullis principle deals with the velocity/pressure reltionship in fluid flow. So in a venturi (like in a carburetor), there is a restrictriction in cross-secitonal area, which increases flow velocity. This restriction then widens out again into a larger cross section area, which results in a reduced velocity. In accordance with bernoulli's pinciple, the seciton with the higher flow velocity (in the restriction) has a reduced pressure compared to the wider lower-velocity section (and compared to static/ambient atmospheric pressure). You can use this pressure difference to suck another fluid (e.g. gasoline) from a port located at the restriction. THAT is an example of bernoulli's principle. This is just entrainment.

wouldnt it be sucking air from another window? or do you make sure this is the only window for it to work,,Reddit
"For those actually curious what this principle is, he discovered that the faster a fluid (gas or liquid) moves, the less pressure it has. It is one of the two ways a wing produces lift (thanks to the airfoil shape, the air over the top travels longer, and therefore faster) [the other way a wing produces lift is by the angle of attack (Newtons conservation of energy) meaning because it pushes air down, it produces lift {and drag}]
The way it is used here is very smart and I've never seen it before, so I don't want to try to explain it and possibly get it wrong. It has been used in carburators to mix the gasoline and air by passing the air through a smaller pipe, speeding it up, sucking the gasoline into it.",,Reddit

One of our fire department officers discovered the hydrovent.us website on YouTube. The officer suggested manufacturing a similar suppression pipe. In good cooperation with the Central Ostrobothnia and Pietarsaari region's fire department, we developed a suppression pipe suitable for our conditions. By mutual agreement with hydrovent.us, we now manufacture HydroVentEurope suppression pipes under license.

"European (Belgian) here who just came back from a one month road trip in the US.
I'm so jealous of the magnificent nature you have in your country, I saw so many beautiful sights! Please treasure it.
I disagree with the low quality food, I had both really good meals and really poor ones. Best Thai food I ever had was in LA.
Also, so many places sell drip coffee just the way I like it, not some watered down espressos. Loved that!
Another like were the many (mostly) clean and free restrooms, Having to pay for using a dirty restroom in a rest area along the highway in Europe sucks. That being said, some restrooms in the US really didn't care about my privacy with one inch gaps everywhere.
Driving was so convenient, being a pedestrian not so much. I biked through SF but couldn't say I felt very safe.

Dislikes were the tipping culture and prices listed pre-tax. I mean, I ordered food or drinks to go a couple of times where I often had to tip in advance only for something to go wrong with my order. Not getting my tip back am I?

Dislike: tipping (I know you have it already but seriously what gives), treatment of indigenous history, lack of consumer protection, level of poverty, strange policy making that reinforces lack of trust in government, occasional respect for road rules, hard to access to good quality produce at a reasonable price, no ring-pulls on tinned food.

I just got back from France yesterday and it was the first time I‚Äôve been to Europe since pre Covid. Before Covid a lot of places didn‚Äôt even do food ‚Äúto-go‚Äù. That seems to have changed. 

I do love having fresh baked bread and cheese for breakfast. Yogurt is also much better in Europe, I don‚Äôt know how the us sucks so hard at yogurt. It really is terrible here. I also can‚Äôt drink American orange juice anymore since having OJ in Europe. 

I just got back from France where we rented a car and drove in Paris. I could not believe how hard it was to see the stop lights, but thought they were in that position to help drivers see pedestrians- that is a really big problem in the Us, not sure how big of an issue it is in the EU.

"Having lived in both for two years, here's my take on both. In Europe I lived in Germany, but travelled around the neighboring countries a bit and now I live in VA. I'm also speaking as a student with limited income lol. I'm mostly writing about what I like, as it what I dislike contrasts pretty well with the other (i.e what I love about Europe I grow to appreciate even more in relation to my time in the US, and vice versa).

Europe
Love
-Public transport, bikes and walking. I don't have a car, but that was never a problem in Europe. I could get anywhere I wanted to pretty feasibly and in good time.

-Healthier food options. I felt so energized my whole time living there, and when I come back, because I feel like I'm eating simpler and healthier most days. I'm Southeast Asian, so it did take a while before I got used to simple foods (like cold cuts, cheese and bread for meals), but I do miss eating that minimally every now and then.

-Prices. Now, it might just be where I live in both, but I found Europe a lot more affordable than the US. Granted, I only had to worry about buying food and going out, but still, I find myself a lot more conscious about my spending when I was in the US. 

-Safety. I felt a lot safer in Europe than the US. As a student in both, gun violence is one difference, yeah, but even then in cities in Europe I felt that there were always all sorts of people (especially women and the elderly) around even in the early morning by themselves, which made me feel that if locals thought it was safe, then I felt safer. Whereas in the US, in large cities, I often have locals warn me about certain areas, especially at night. Fortunately I've never had incidents in either country, but still.

-LGBT life. Speaking as a gay person, Europe has more options. I feel safe in most places in both, especially with friends around, but I feel that European cities had more diverse and um... Liberated venues, so to speak. Which I'm a fan of. 

US:
-Friendly and open people. I actually think the Europe I saw was very friendly! But people in the US are next level friendly, and as an outgoing person myself, I really do enjoy that about being in the US. I often chat with people at stores, bars, in rideshares and around my college campus too, which I didn't get to experience as much in Europe (though that might also be the language barrier at play).

-More food diversity. I lived in two cities of comparable size in both, and even in other cities that are similarly large, I just think the US' history of migration has led it to evolve such a rich and diverse food culture. There're so many options for dining places. Again, not to say Europe didn't have options, but the US just has a lot more places that are also a lot more mixed at an accessible level. Tipping still sucks though, but I still make sure to tip as well as I could. Just because I disagree with the conditions that led to tipping doesn't give me the right to screw over my server. 

-Speaking of diversity, the US definitely feels more diverse as a whole, even outside of large cities. I get along with most people, but there's a quicker level of connection I'm able to get with US PoC for some reason that I didn't feel as much in Europe.

Even though I have more things listed that I like in Europe, I really do enjoy both for their own merits! Didn't expect my comment to be this long though",,Reddit
"Nice to get your perspective. Considering the reputation Holland has for being, well, ahem‚Ä¶ ‚Äúmoney focused‚Äù let‚Äôs say, it‚Äôs really surprising to me that the Dutch aren‚Äôt asking for to-go boxes for every scrap of food they don‚Äôt finish during a meal. 

Enjoyed your notes and it‚Äôs nice to see a post that is not looking to just stir the pot. 

I will offer one criticism: it‚Äôs almost impossible to categorically define American food. It is true that a lot of it is absolutely packed with sugar and is highly processed. But I live in a part of the country where I can (and do) access nothing but very, very fresh fruits, vegetables, high quality baked goods, cheeses, beers and wines, etc.",,Reddit
"One major disagreement: There is a lot of really good cheese produced in this country. Especially Cheddar-style cheese from Vermont and Wisconsin. There is also some very good goat cheese. The rest of the cheese, you are right, it's mostly pretty terrible.

I think you had a very small sample size on your recent visit. For example, only the really cheap hotels use paper plates and plastic cutlery. If you chose to visit the cheapest hotels, that is biasing your sample.

The rest is just what you are habituated to. A typical American visiting Europe would think it's really bizarre to eat cold sliced meat at breakfast. We expect hot meats and freshly cooked eggs. When I visit Europe it's amazing to have 3 or 4 different types of fresh bread and 3-4 meats and cheeses, but it's not what we're used to.",,Reddit
"> Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.

Traffic lights are also like this in Ireland and the UK.

> The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

This is also fairly common in Ireland. Not in very fancy restaurants, but otherwise the majority of places have no issue with this.",,Reddit
"I went to LA recently and found the car centric culture suuuuper inconvenient for a tourist. Every time you want to see a thing, you need to research it beforehand and then drive there. Want to see another thing? More research, then drive.

Admittedly it was a short trip and maybe I did it wrong, but the closest thing to being able to just wander around was in downtown, and even there you occasionally have to walk over a nice 8 lane highway, which is a long way to walk (and be wary of certain neighborhoods and whatever). 

That and since a car had to be involved at every step, you couldn't really stop for a few beers or whatever. I guess locals either plan their days better or drive drunk.",,Reddit
Hard to give this context without saying the cities.. so many different cultures within America,,Reddit
"Regarding free refills, the majority of restaurants in the US have carbonated drink dispensers, hooked up to boxes of soda syrup/juice in a back room. The syrup is mixed with water and CO2 as they dispense it. You‚Äôll see they have ‚Äúsoda guns‚Äù at bars as well. This makes soda very inexpensive. Compared to many places in Europe where I notice only stocks soft drinks and juices in glass bottles and cans, so you order per item. Things I love about the Netherlands is how compact and well connected it is. In the USA I feel like we are forever just driving from parking lot to parking lot.",,Reddit

"As an American who lived in Europe for 6 years I enjoyed reading your list! It took me about a year of living abroad to understand the things I loved about my own country, including the vastness of nature, the general friendliness and openness, the ability to try lots of things out or shift careers, and the sense of humor (I found my Dutch friends to be most similar to me in openness and humor). I also understand that just because Americans are generally friendly on the surface it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre shallow or we make friends faster than Europeans ‚Äî there‚Äôs just less daily friction in our interactions. 

Ugh, the plastic! And tipping! Couldn‚Äôt agree more. 

Food can be great here (even breakfast) but you have to know where to go and what to look for. Vermont, New York and Wisconsin make some stellar cheese, but again it takes some effort. As for food in general, it makes me cry that i can walk into a cafe in Vienna and eat a simple and beautiful 2 course meal for 10 Euros, and nothing like that exists here. My town has fantastic coffee shops but I‚Äôm not going to get a meal there. I‚Äôm still dreaming about the porchetta I had in Italy recently.

"Good analysis. But mate, if you‚Äôre not enjoying breakfast in the US, you‚Äôre definitely going wrong. 

Breakfast is one of the things I missed most while living in Europe. Bacon, omelettes, lox, sausage, beef brisket and egg tacos, low key diners, high end brunch spots ‚Äî the list is literally endless. 

The variety of breakfast is one thing that the US absolutely shits on Europe. When I lived in Italy and Hungary, or traveling to most any of 27 countries ‚Äî it was always a pastry, sliced meats, and espresso/cappuccino.

The US makes great cheese. It‚Äôs just the processed cheese is what you‚Äôll find in most places. And even if you don‚Äôt like it can‚Äôt find the artisanal cheeses, you can still enjoy literally any type of imported cheese from Europe or the Middle East.

Tipping:  Yeah its a pain, but in my mind I am always calculating price and 20+%.  I would love for workers to be paid more, but that isn't going to happen.  PS I also tip in Europe.  No one has refused my tip. 

Food:  We have a different breakfast culture.  Most regular folks do not eat like they would at a hotel for breakfast.  Egg and toast is pretty much it at my house.  Dinner is another story.   There is a lot of variety depending on where you are, though as a tourist I do not blame you for straying into too many local restaurants. 

Plastic:  Yes too much. Hotels do this for cost and also this became very popular during COVID.

\- Plastic isn't going anywhere.  Same with free refills.  Every so often people try to outlaw free refills because of health conditions or whatever by taxing soda.  They tried this in Chicago and within minutes people were selling blackmarket soda without the tax.  Issue is restaurants selling togo stuff are expected to provide eating utensils, and a lot of places don't have the staff for people to wash.

I have 2 dislikes about Europe although I'm not sure how much either of these is a problem in Netherlands specifically (been there once, for 3 days..) - lack of window screens and much higher amount of smoking in public than here.  And y'all need to air condition more buildings with the way the climate has been heading.  

Oh and one big thing the Netherlands does right is bike lanes.  I love how (in Amsterdam at least) there were lanes for cars that had actual small physical barriers to the bike lanes and the bikes were separated from the pedestrians as well.

Yeah - the tipping. Gotta say I enjoyed and enjoy tipping waiters in restaurants growing up and a couple of other tipping rituals: mailman/barber/cabs.

I don‚Äôt have to tip of course but I find it reprehensible that I‚Äôm even asked. I can‚Äôt get a thank you - a your welcome - or a kind smile - but I‚Äôm expected to tip you and your business for handing me a $6 croissant. Again - culturally - the tipping I grew up on put a minimal dent to my own economic life and it - looking back - was a worthwhile exchange. Nowadays I don‚Äôt even want to go out as it‚Äôs stifling to see 18%. 20% 25%. Also with increase in tip suggestions I find customer service horrendous. In California half the people in customer service positions should tip me for walking them through their job. It‚Äôs abysmal. Speaking experientially day in and day out.,,Reddit

Thought I‚Äôd reply with my 2 cents as an American tourist in the Netherlands:

Pros:

Amsterdam is a beautiful city. I thought the architecture in Amsterdam was too notch. The city was pretty clean and felt safe too!

Fresh and tasty food everywhere! Maybe this is just my perception from my recent experience but every meal we ate seemed like it was made from fresh ingredients. Made everything seem that much more tasty. Especially the cheese!

The walkability. A 30 minute walk in Amsterdam city center was nothing. If anything it was a delight walking past tiny cafes and beautiful buildings. In the US a 30 minute walk is a no go almost anywhere. A 30 minute walk in Texas means your walking along major roads and under/over freeway overpasses. 

Tipping was totally not expected! Anytime I did tip the servers in NL were genuinely grateful. Unlike the US where if you don‚Äôt tip it‚Äôs viewed very negatively. 

Lots of really cool things to do. From museums, to river cruises, and Coffee shops. Need I say more?

Cons: 

Taxi drivers try to take advantage of you. Maybe this is the same in the US but I don‚Äôt ever use taxis here. In Amsterdam I tried approaching taxi drivers and they almost always made up some kind of excuse like ‚Äúminimum payment is ‚Ç¨40 regardless of distance‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can only take you this far, you have to walk the rest‚Äù. I learned to just use uber while I was there

Hard to find gluten free food! I have celiac disease so I have to eat gluten free. Not much of a problem if in the US for a number of reasons but in the Netherlands, restaurants rarely advertised gluten free options, had gluten free menus, or had any items on their menu that were gluten free. 

Can‚Äôt think of much else! Maybe just that it‚Äôs a little expensive. But I certainly thought the Netherlands was worth it!",,Reddit
"Where are you eating? It sounds like you're very much doing that part wrong.

That said, America *does* make it spectacularly easy to do it wrong, when it comes to food. There's just so much excess everywhere, I could totally understand how a tourist might not know what to get and what not to get.

But I've also spent a lot of time all over Europe, and while I really wound up appreciating the fact that good salads and vegetable-forward dishes were often the best options on the menu, I certainly wouldn't compare the variety of food options to the variety that can be found in major US cities.

As someone who's spent a lot of time living/travelling in both the US and Europe (with neither being home), this is perhaps the one point I would disagree. With the exception of food in Italy and Hungary, the diversity and quality of dinner that one can find in major cities across the US tends to be far better (although one can find awful food, too)

5. Metric system ‚ù§Ô∏è

">Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.

This one is hard to disagree with. We Americans have *a lot* of nature and a lot of it is relatively untouched. Here in California where I live, it is somewhat easy to get to places in nature where you can look all over for any sign of human presence and not find it. I can hike for hours off trail without seeing another human or sign of anyone having been there. 

I've never experienced anything remotely close to this in Europe. As a matter of fact, I keep trying to just to see if it can be done. I assume it can, but it seems really tough. Almost always in the mountains you see a trail, a hut, an antenna or even places where someone has written their name by arranging the rocks in a meadow. 

On the other hand, I have to admit there is something special about hiking for a few hours to a nice refugio and having someone else cook for you and offer a glass of wine. :)

&#x200B;

>People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.

I agree! Contrary to the myth of the rude American, I think people are quite friendly here. 

I do disagree with your comment about the Dutch being rude. I thought they were quite friendly, as well as the people in other European countries where I've travelled being friendly. It does seem like Europeans are less likely to engage or start a conversation with strangers, but I don't count that as being rude - I just think of it as a cultural difference.

>Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.

This is true, but it doesn't excite me too much. Except in the case of coffee. And if you travel to certain secret parts of the midwestern United States, you often get free beer refills. (Not officially, but it's quite common if you've had a couple of beers and order a third, the bartender will comp you).

>  
The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

I agree and love this one. I've always wondered why it is not more common in Europe.

>  
Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.

I feel like I'm agreeing with you too often, but this is another case of agreement. I think the tide is starting to turn on tipping in the US. At one point it seemed like an ok idea. An incentive for the server to provide good service. But tipping has gotten to high and we're not expected to tip for almost everything. And as far as incentives, a bad actor who does not tip will save themselves quite a bankroll over the course of a year.

&#x200B;

>The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.

Here I've got to disagree, with a few caveats. America is a really large and diverse place. I think if you go to cities like NYC, SF, LA and Chicago you will find food variety and quality to surpass anywhere in Europe. On the other hand if you go to anytown, USA, you'll have to search quite a bit among several bad options. 

We also have amazing cheese. I'm risking ruffling feathers here, but I think the cheese and beer in the US is as good, or in some cases better, than that in Europe. There, I said it. However, we also have lots of bad beer, and something that is very hard to find in Europe: bad cheese. America has a lot of so called ""commodity cheese"" in addition to the artisanal varieties produced in California, Wisconsin, Vermont and Oregon. 

&#x200B;

>Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.

Good observation. I agree. 

&#x200B;

>Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?

This one makes my blood boil. When I was a child, there was a movement to covert us young ones to using the metric system, but it never stuck. Not only is the metric system more intuitive with everything based on 10, it's also used almost everywhere in the world. 

A few of my own:

* I think the homelessness problem is much worse and how it's being handled is much worse in the US.
* It seems like there is much more tourist scamming and pickpocketing in Europe than in the US.
* Europe has better architecture and more walkable cities. There are some really ugly car based place in the US that are just strip malls and parking lots. These places do offer convenience, but I wish we had more of a balance. 
* I love how European cities still have a sense of history and connection with the past. Small museums and street musicians playing classical music are really nice.",,Reddit

"> Imperial measurements

Unfortunate circumstances from a failing economy in the 80s.

In the 70s the US passed legislation that would have put us fully in metric by the 90s. After about a decade, and billions of dollars spent, this was stopped during the Reagan administration due to budget cuts.

Fun fact, due to machinery made to be compliant with the metric initiative, and global operations, the US is largely metric in the industrial sense, and fully metric in sciences. Engineering is still mixed though, e.g., civil engineering designing highways is not metric, electrical and chemical engineering are all metric, mechanical is mixed depending on the application.

The food one hit hard. Our food is absolute garbage driven by corporate greed. They are killing us slowly with chemicals and serving it to us with a smile. Lower income people can‚Äôt afford to eat healthy. This bothers me deeply as a ‚ÄòMerican.,,Reddit
"Murrican here. Yes, tipping is a HUGE problem. Corporate america refuses to pay a fair, living wage, and so wants US, the consumer, to fork out more money to subsidize their wealth. They also have a lot of workers on welfare, making us pay even more, or again for something THEY should be paying for.
sugar has also grown from a fairly large problem to epidemic proportions. We assume it is a combo of food manufacturers wanting to make us all addicted to sugar and thus their product, and the health industry wanting more business and being willing to make us (or LET us) become more sick so they have more maladies to treat. NOT ONE doctor will tell you to cut down on sugar. Some dieticians will, but most people don't go to dieticians till they have really serious problems.
Plastic has really gotten out of hand. IF you order food to go, they will include plastic cutlery whether you ask for it or not. we REALLY need to get rid of as much as we can, but it is seen as a corporate issue and corporate america doesn't give a damn.

we tried to switch to metric several decades ago, and there was a LOT of pushback from a lot of businesses.  I assume they were measuring device manufacturers and construction related companies. Metric makes great sense to a lot of us, but it is unlikely our government will mandate it any time soon. we can't even get people to vaccinate like we did when i was a kid, and we felt we were being patriotic then. This has to do with REpublicans crippling public education for 50 years. People are just DUMBER by design. Dumb shits believe stupid lies that politicians sell. we are doomed. run! lol",,Reddit

"I won't really comment on the things you like because I feel like it would be hard to argue with any of those.

For the things you don't like:

1. 100% agree. Tipping culture in the US is completely out of hand as well as pricing. I would be all for moving towards an all-inclusive pricing system. That said, I do understand why tax is usually separate. It's a good reminder to know what you're paying in tax.
2. Food in the US is a travesty compared with the rest of the world, both in terms of quality and variety as you mention. Food standards in Europe are far higher than they are in the US an the ease of access to fresh, healthy ingredients is just night and day. To be honest, I don't even eat breakfast 90% of the time. That 10% where I do is comp breakfast at hotels.
3. The plastic industry is big. I don't like it, primarily from a health/toxin point of view. Where practical I much prefer paper and glass products. That said, I'll go to my grave using plastic straws. I've tried every alternative and they all suck. Plastic has its place in certain things.
4. This doesn't bother me. I know both systems well and can easily flip back and fourth between the two. The cost of changing every sign, instrument panel on every car, truck, etc.  every volumetric container, wouldn't really seem to be worth it.

What types of restaurants did you go to? There is a MAJOR difference between some rural mom n pop place and some big city chain.

Yes i agree we all use too much single use plastic.

* Even with the prior point, tourist/convenient food is hit or miss in either continent. I've found amazing restaurants and cafes by spending time researching what's good in both places. McDonald's is disappointing no matter where you are in the world.
* Public transport in the EU is light years ahead of the US. The Metro, London Underground, and the Eurail make getting around much more convenient and less stressful than dealing with traffic. I did not encounter any strikes, which may have changed my opinion, although the trains in Italy were less than timely -- by a lot.

"""American cheese is the best cheese for a cheeseburger because it melts without splitting."" -Chef Slowik (The Menu)

But as far as food in the US, you really need to be able to find the right places to get fresh foods cooked the right way. If you are traveling extensively, that is very hard to do, especially since most Americans don't even look for that when they are getting breakfast or lunch. I've cooked and served at a lot of places in Georgia and Minnesota, and the majority of places will rely on preserved food if you don't want a high check and high tip. Tipping, yes, it's a hassle. Focus on what that person does for you. Having served plenty of places, I don't expect a tip above 10%/15% unless I have guided a table through their dining experience. But don't feel bad about tipping poorly (especially since you are from europe and most americans expect you to tip poorly). In most places, servers do well and expect other people to make up for the bad tips you get. Have a good trip!",,Reddit

In states it is for car flow. Wast amount of space on roads as well. There is stop signs for pedestrian areas so if there is light nearby make sure to look bit further including the lights.

"[Here](https://x.com/Justin_Br0nk/status/1872226113658949937) is a video of it in flight.

According to [here](https://aviationweek.com/defense/new-chinese-advanced-combat-aircraft-emerge-flight):

> Steve Trimble December 26, 2024

> New Chinese combat aircraft broke cover in a flood of social media photos and videos on Dec. 26 showing them in flight and revealing two new examples of China‚Äôs evolution as an aerospace innovator.

> One new aircraft appeared in social media posts revealing a large, three-engine warplane with a cockpit and diamond-style wing with no vertical tails. Yaw control appears to be managed by Northrop Grumman B-2-style split rudders.

> The engines are fed by a single dorsal inlet and two ventral inlets, the latter using caret-shaped intakes. The dorsal inlet features a stealth-enhancing diverterless supersonic inlet, but not the ventral inlets.

> The aircraft‚Äôs large ventral fuselage section likely provides room for an internal weapons bay. The main landing gear features two wheels each, a hallmark of heavy fighter-bombers, such as the Sukhoi Su-34.

> The apparent test flight over a populated Chinese area included appearances by a Chengdu-manufactured J-20S fighter, possibly flying a chase mission.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs size and arrangement tentatively suggests that this is the long awaited J/H-XX ‚Äòregional bomber‚Äô, designed to provide a low observable high altitude precision strike capability against bases and possibly ships throughout the Indo-Pacific,‚Äù said Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for Airpower and Technology at the Royal United Services Institute. ‚ÄúHowever, it remains possible that this prototype represents China‚Äôs known 6th Generation fighter program.‚Äù

> Hours later, further social media posts revealed images and video of a second new Chinese combat aircraft, also in flight test. 

> The images show a more traditional fighter design with a cranked arrow planform and possibly folding tailfins. It was not immediately clear when these images were captured, but one post marked the picture with a Dec. 22, 2024 time-stamp.

> The mystery warplanes emerged on the 13th anniversary of the roll-out of the J-20 stealth fighter, which itself came 13 years after the first flight of the Chengdu-made J-10 in March, 1998. The Dec. 26 date marks the 131st birthday of Mao Zedong, the late founder of the Chinese Communist Party.

> The role each of the aircraft would perform is not immediately apparent. No Chinese government or industry channel has acknowledged the imagery on official channels, but there also appears little effort by internal security services to censor the content posted by dozens of people on the ground.

> China has been developing the H-20 long-range stealth bomber and the medium-range JH-XX fighter-bomber, according to the annual China Military Power Report published by the U.S. Defense Department. Chinese industry officials also have confirmed that work is underway on a sixth-generation fighter.",,Reddit

You don't think they've got a massive industrial base and highly educated population (that is what, 5x larger than America's?)? 

Now I'm not saying their military is at technological parity with America, but I wouldn't just bury my head in the sand and pretend that China is not catching up and maybe even surpassing in some areas.

Also, they don't really need to beat us in a conventional war.  What happens when things heat up and China says ""Ok, exports stopped"". Ya, it will hurt their economy, but it will devastate ours.  Americans won't know what to do when we no longer have access to our cheap goods.    
China will just be able to keep making everything domestically - we have no factories, we have no skilled engineers.

"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll crack the code and design an effective engine eventually. Their stealth fighters (they have two) are clearly underpowered, relying on iterative improvements of a Soviet engine. Without a powerplant that can move these jets without compromising stealth characteristics, this and the two fighters demonstrate potential but are relegated to ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù status.

China is missing a large, stealth bomber capable of delivering a nuclear bomb, but the wunderwaffen nonsense about this plane with contradictory statements and characteristics is wild.

"Heavy and stealth are usually not paired together‚Ä¶ and based on the look of this craft I get the feeling it is not really that stealthy considering the intakes have a decent surface area with not a lot of angle disruption.


Then the center body of the aircraft has too steep and smooth of a slope and would be detectable by good radars from the side especially.

I could see this being a good stealth spy craft because it does appear like it would disrupt radar reflections enough at long range.",,Reddit

"Heat the dent with a hairdryer until it's warm to the touch. For small dents, skip this step and start at step 3.

Suction the dent outward using a dent puller. The goal is to make the dent smaller, not eliminate it completely.

Wipe the metal with a microfiber towel. If you're repairing a small metal dent, start at this step.

Prepare to use the bridge puller. To use this tool, you glue a bolt (known as a head) to the deepest point of the dent, use it to pull the dent out and later remove it. The first step is to apply the glue that came in your repair kit to the deepest point of the dent.

Attach the bridge puller head. Push it into the glue and allow it to cool for the time indicated in the directions. Usually, that's about 4-8 minutes.

Use the bridge puller. When the glue is completely dry, attach the bridge puller and turn the dial to slowly move the metal. Stop when the dent is gone and the metal is in its original position.",,Reddit
"That's not medieval armor, that's early modern plate armor designed specifically to withstand a (early modern) musket ball. You can tell it's not medieval by the fact that it has a ridged spine down the front and extends all the way down to the pelvis. The ridge is primarily there to provide a glancing surface for a lead ball, but also serves to be a point of great strength if a lead ball hits it dead on. Medieval plate armor has a more globular shape in the chest area and tapered in around the midsection, giving the wearer an hourglass figure.",,Reddit
"Slightly misleading title, but I assume you just found the clip and don't know where it comes from. 

So, in this little documentary, they are testing out armour plating of various periods and how the Renaissance era soldiery adapted to the arrival of the gunpowder weaponry. Before this clip, they fire at the standard late period (1300-1400) medieval armour, and the ball basically goes straight through it and embed itself in the dummy. This clip is when they applied a special type of plate over the top of the standard armour. Commonly, this was purchased by nobles and was even equipped on ground infantry if they served a particularly wealthy lord. As you can see, the round hits and then flattens. Is actaully rather incredible if you think about it. 

Many nobles beleaved that the gunpowder weapons were a fad that were too slow to fire and impractical...... that was until they got better, and the musket came along. Also, very intelligent people realised that the shortcomings of the weapons could be mitgated by simply applying more on mass, plus you can stick a pointy bit at the end and now you have the most common weapon on earth, a spear.",,Reddit

It should also be noted that musket-proof armour is attested to in historical sources *but* it is expensive and could reasonably only be expected to find on wealthy cavalrymen. Several 16th century authors for this case argue that the common soldier shouldn't wear breastplates because they don't stop muskets and only serve to encumber the solider - counter-arguments from contemporary authors say that they're still good for melee fighting.

Anyway these armours would have some space in between the chest and the actual armour, meaning that an impact such as this would be diminished quite heavily and the person wearing the armour above would've been able to keep on fighting.",,Reddit

"As usual, some Americans in this thread who have never left their country will downplay the Cartel and call them ‚Äúgangs‚Äù and cosplayers. They‚Äôre not gangs. They‚Äôre not cosplaying. They are  highly organized and sophisticated terrorist groups operating with billions of dollars of funding and near total impunity. They recruit heavily from the Mexican and other Latin American militaries (along with retired US military if rumors are to be believed), and have defeated the Mexican army on numerous occasions now. These aren‚Äôt the gangs of teenagers with pistols you see in LA or New York. This isn‚Äôt little Timmy with his airsoft gun. 

The Mexican cartels have killed some 400,000 people in the last 20 years. For perspective, most estimates of how many people ISIS have killed number under 40,000. The cartel have more blood on their hands than ISIS and Al-Qaeda combined yet Redditors seem convinced they are nothing at all to worry about.",,Reddit

They might look super advanced but most of this stuff is stuff you can own as well. Weird radio placement on the leg though,,Reddit
"So if you guys just look closely, anyone who's either been in combat, trained in any kind of CQB, or played any video games, you'll realize that the amount of gear that they have is pretty absurd and unrealistic. It not only would restrict movement but it would slow you down and create a lot of noise if doing a stealth raid. 

I've never been in the military but even I know that's too much gear for any type of mission. And then there's the sticker on their goggles. You shouldn't have anything that would obstruct your vision. 

And look at their radios. WTF is that?!! And why does every guy need one? Usually, on a team, you have one guy who is responsible for establishing communications. Maybe it's urban warfare and everybody needs a radio, but I've never known anyone to wear something with so many damn antennas. 

I am almost positive this is all just for show. Like fear-mongering. Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",,Reddit

"No plate carrier and no mags, what is this paintball gear?",,Reddit
"Your equipment has nothing to do with your training. There's plenty of grunts, with just their uniform, a single knee pad, standard kevlar + helmet, that are crack shots and know how to handle any combat situation.

"most of their gear isn't really that impressive. the vest is just webbing not a plate carrier probably just Kevlar, use of 1 beta mag with no extra mags visible means they will have to mainly use their handgun. No radio headset means they have to use a handheld radio but with the jammer they all have I doubt they can get a good signal. So its mostly a smoke show of looking like the stereotype ""operator"".

"I had the pleasure of working with the Mexican Marines for a couple of month about a decade or so ago. They were incredibly professional and far more disciplined than we expected. We were training them on UXO/counter-IED doctrine, and to hear the extent to which the cartels have basically become ‚ÄúState Actors‚Äù was insane. They are far more sophisticated and capable than any terror group we‚Äôd had to deal with in the Middle East, except for maybe Hezbollah (which I had never personally had to interact with). They make standardized ordnance, possibly started the modern iteration of drone warfare, have heavy equipment, and legitimate training. 

But the Mexican Marines are very professional and in the first engagement we observed, the cartel (decked out sorta like professional militaries) broke contact and scattered, allowing the Marines to kill or detain most of them with no injuries. The cartel members breaking contact and scattering is not surprising, it‚Äôs the standard practice in asymmetric warfare, but the way the Marines were able to find them all in a rough environment was pretty cool to see. 

Maybe things have changed since the last time I was down there, but either way, I hope the best for Mexico and also hope U.S. policy can change because the cartels will never go away so long as the war on drugs exists.",,Reddit
There are quite a few ex SF in those cartels.,,Reddit

And also, those grenades on his chest are 40mm grenade launcher rounds, and he doesn't even have one on his loadout.

Anecdotally, I knew of someone back when I lived in Texas.  He served from 1987(?) to 2003, served in Kosovo, Iraq I, Afghanistan and Iraq II, and was retired due to injury (but you wouldn't know just by looking at him, he had all his facilities).

He would make repeated trips to the Mexican border at Matamoros to get medication for his conditions, because there was too much red tape to get it back home, plus his disability payment was fuck all.  Eventually, it got out that he was a retired combat soldier, with *considerable* experience... He was approached by a farmer, to train his men to defend themselves.

A certain cartel found out, rather than kill him,  they offered to pay him to train their men.  I don't know the dollar amount, but it set him for life.",,Reddit
Sure it‚Äôs not the proud boys?,,Reddit
5.11 tactical wear. ¬†the cartel got these guys out there in tactical gear from temu.

2. On the other hand, there are people wearing ""shitty airsoft gear"" in Ukraine right now fighting one of the largest modern military forces with relative success (that's a stretch for Russia, but still)

3. There are anti-junta forces in Myanmar with homemade guns and t-shirts effectively fighting a relatively modern military. 

4. The Mujahadeen and later the Taliban and Al-Queda have demonstrated strategic success against Russia and the United States, while using gear from the 1940s-1960s. They still got clapped tactically due to lack of night vision, low quality comms, and lack of air support. But, no modern military has managed to defeat Afghan guerilla fighters with extremely outdated gear. 

Guess what I'm trying to say is that a lot of the armchair experts here commenting ""b-b-but it's airsoft gear"" tend to forget that it doesn't matter if the guy shooting at you is wearing Crye or AliExpress- the bullets are still made of metal.",,Reddit

"It‚Äôs a highly sought after position in the correctional system.  They‚Äôre able to get out of their cells, off the block and get outdoors and learn skills, get experience, and give back to society.  There‚Äôs many incentives and helps with early release.  It‚Äôs also completely voluntary.  

They are kept out of the high risk areas of the fire using indirect firefighting tactics.  

Fire departments are changing policies and helping to change laws to allow them to employ inmates firefighters.",,Reddit
"The crazy part is that $5.80 is after a recent raise in 2023. Before that it was $2.90.

And just for context this is a volunteer program. They are not forced to do this.

Edit - I want to clear up a few things. I'm not an LAFD employee, I'm a pilot. However I have 3 immediate family and 4 friends who are and this is the only thing I'm basing this off, yes word of mouth. 

1. This pay rate is per DAY not hour

2. Do they deserve more money imo? Yes they are in the danger zone.

3. These guys are volunteering to do this. They are trusted to go help society and are rewarded for it with time off sentence, time away from jail, better food etc. I applaud them.

4. They are in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM firefighters. They are support crew. They clear brush and other mundane tasks. Still can't disregard their service being in the hot spot.

5. Yes they are being exploited. Even if they got $20 an hour our county has no reason to hire regular fireman when they can do this. They are also not in duty all the time. They are activated only in times like this. Starting pay here is $100k. That's an easy $150k with OT. There was one notable fireman who made $750k last year.

6. This isn't BFE. LAFD is the leader. That's why the salary is so high, they want to attract top talent. Maybe elsewhere when there is an opening they get some applicants but here there are THOUSANDS.

7. Last thing and I'm sure I'm missing important things is yes I feel they are being exploited but without full info it's hard to paint a full picture. Before you get red in the face and want to attack Reddit style remember this was an opinion and the best way to express yourself is being human accompanied by facts.

That‚Äôs part of digging yourself out of past mistakes - it‚Äôs not always easy or paid well. I commend these guys for doing it and trying to better themselves. The interviewer seems like a d bag,,Reddit

One thing that‚Äôs not mentioned is for every day they‚Äôre on a fire they get a day knocked off their sentence. And that $5.80 an hour or whatever they‚Äôre making gets saved so they have something to start with when they get out. They get more freedoms in fire camp, better grub, more privileges than they would in a ‚Äúmain line‚Äù facility. Plus they get training in firefighting and build skills in other forestry disciplines such as trail building, tree planting, pre commercial thinning, not to mention the added benefit of adding to their self pride and self worth by helping people in need. There‚Äôs nothing more prideful than knowing you helped someone and/or saved their home, maybe their life. I got one guy on my crew who was in for 7 years total, the last 5 on an inmate fire crew.

Ive spoken to these dudes on the ground. They all agree they would love to get paid more. However they understand that they have been given a great opportunity to get training and experience. And most of them got options once they get out. 

And a lot of these dudes actually don't go into firefighting... They start tree cutting businesses making way more than any municipal firefighter ever will.",,Reddit
"I just gotta say ""Fuck the guy in the Carhartt"" trying to gaslight these guys out there who are laying it on the line. Is it fair, dunno, I can't account for all of their situations. Is it bullshit to gaslight these guys for being able to taking advantage of a second chance and doing a civil service for their community without regard for money. Hell yeah. The only thing Carhartt understands is money. Money won't buy their souls, and I believe that they have a better understanding of life and humanity than he ever will.

Hasan piker meanwhile is monetizing this moment for his own personal gains and views. Knowing damn well he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the prisoners,,Reddit
"Lol of course Hasan Piker is out here equating this program to slavery.

Brother, the biggest part of rehabilitation and preparing people for the real work upon release is getting them a job while they're in prison, so they can transfer those skills into the real world where they will receive real wage.

When you're incarcerated, you have your room, board, healthcare, and other services taken care of for you. So it's kind of disingenuous to compare incarcerated wages to that of a private citizen, as all of their income they earn at $5/h should be discretionary.

I'm confident the guys in this video will end up doing great in life once they're released, so long as they stick with the same or similar career path. Finding meaning is what keeps you from doing things that get locked up in the first place, as you don't want to lose all you've built.",,Reddit
So what's new? My brother was a incarcerated firefighter a long as time ago he said it was hard work but it was better than being locked up all the time.,,Reddit

"I know the guy with the glasses is trying to point out the injustice, but he's coming across as a real dick to these firefighters. They understand their situation pretty well I'm sure buddy, it feels like you're rubbing it in their faces. 

Good for the incarcerated firefighters on being proactive with their situation. I hope they get the compensation they deserve one day for their services.",,Reddit

"i really appreciate how these incarcerated fire fighters are seeing the holistic view beyond the pay.

while hasan has a point, he's not making the situation any better by saying, ""ooOOoh but these ff are getting paid $XXXX more while you have pennies."" not the point.",,Reddit
"Seems like a good program, but there is ZERO chance they will land careers as firefighters after getting released. I hope they aren't being coerced with false hopes of future jobs as firefighters.",,Reddit
This is old. They have had inmates as firefighters for years. People never google or look up anything until someone puts it on a video.,,Reddit

"Ok that's a fair point, but why are we hearing it from terrorist sympathizer Hasan Picker?

EDIT: Nothing brings out uninformed political takes and whataboutisms like knocking Hasan so I guess I'll spell it out plainly.

1a. Attacking civilian ships or holding civilian hostages in order to affect a political end are both acts of terrorism. The Houthis have done both and continue to hold said hostages more than a year later. This is why the Houthis *easily* fit the label of ""terrorists"".

1b. No whataboutism about ""the IDF are terrorists too"" will ever change this or justify terrorism in any way.

1c. Hasan has [showed Houthi propaganda on stream](https://arazu.io/t3_1frphv2/?timeframe=all&category=hot) and justified the terroristic act of attacking the Galaxy Leader as a ""deterent"".

1d. It's also important to note that [Twitch explicitly forbids](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#5TerrorismandViolentExtremism) ""content that depicts, glorifies, encourages, or supports terrorism, or violent extremist actors or acts .... even for the purposes of denouncing such content"". Hasan doesn't denounce it though, as seen below.

2a. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the Gulf Cooperation Council (and their members Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and UAE), Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Estonia, Germany, Honduras, Israel, Kosovo, Lithuania, Paraguay, Serbia, Slovenia, the UK, the US, and Guatemala. The EU also considers the military wing a terrorist org.

2b. Here is a [list of Hezbollah's terrorist acts](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah). It includes 2011 support for Assad who has killed far more Muslims than Israel ever has. Civilian deaths at the hands of Assad's forces:

* The Syrian Network for Human Rights [estimates 201,234 civilian deaths](https://snhr.org/blog/2024/08/30/civilian-death-toll/).
* The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [estimates 164,223 civilian deaths](https://www.syriahr.com/en/328044/) (including 49,452 who died under torture).
* The Violations Documentation Center in Syria [estimated 111,016 deaths in 2020](https://vdc-sy.net/monthly-statistical-report-causalities-syria-november-2020/).

2c. Hasan [doesn't have an issue](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/left-wing-pundit-hasan-piker-says-i-dont-have-an-issue-with-hezbollah-praises-yemens-houthis-for-seizing-ships/) with Hezbollah. Why? Because (up until a while ago) they'd been ""pretty successful against Israel"".",,Reddit
"I love everyone getting offended on their behalf.  I guarantee none of them would give up this opportunity because I've seen how hard they work to get into fire camp.  But keep calling them slaves. Not dedicated volunteers who are working hard to get credits toward their sentence and get out sooner while learning valuable skills and providing back to the community.  Not inmates who have committed serious offenses but have actually taken advantage of rehabilitative opportunities, proven themselves by qualifying for fire camp, and exercise agency over their situation by bettering it.

B) May help when they petition for early release based on behavior and the service they provided.

C) if they publicly shit on the program on an online interview they may lose this highly sought after position and get replaced by someone else.",,Reddit

You see I'm not sure about this. I think this is tantamount to slavery and that these men aren't paid a fraction of what they should be getting.

"In Oregon if you are gate cleared and able then you are forced to be a firefighter. If you refuse then you are thrown in the hole and lose any possible good time you may have earned for an early release. You may make $3 a day.

For roughly 100 years until just a couple of years ago, Oregon had a 10-2 system. If you had the money to go to trial and 2 people say you are innocent then the courts still found you guilty. Prosecutors would offer you a ""deal"" even for things you were not accused of as long as they got a conviction. If you refused the deal then they would layer-cake trumped up charges with Mandatory minimums.

And no you do not get to be a fire fighter when you get out even if you are trained. 

Some prisons even trained structural fire fighters if they could not get insurance on the facility. Prisons make good money outsourcing inmates to the city and private contracting.

I worked at a prison doing their finances and logistics. The governor shut that prison down. The local economy took a big hit.",,Reddit

"Lots of misinformation running around here.
The inmate handcrew firefighter program (there are also inmate staffed prison fire departments. This isn't about them) is an actual voluntary program (unlike like most other prison work programs) that is highly sought after. They get better living conditions with better food (and more of it on fires), no cells, less guards, no armed guards, no gun towers, no barbed wire, for some they live in some of the most beautiful places in the state, get more conjugal visits, receive job training in at least two trades including wildland firefighting, get 2 for 1 time off their sentence, and can petition to have their records expunged. They can and do get hired by Cal Fire and the Feds, and now many local government departments.

These media articles pop up with this garbage every major fire, some new liberal reporter rewrites a prior article without doing much research, then people run around all flutter screaming about slavery until the next shiny object comes along and don't actually help the subject of their excitement because they don't want to do the work of crime reduction and prison reform, meanwhile people that actually know the facts and have worked in or with the program have to repeat ourselves over and over again explaining it. WTF? Butt-hurt about inmate firefighters? Fix the reasons they are in prison in the first place.",,Reddit
"I will say that Washington's program is much better than this. They get paid fairly well fighting fires and can obtain 5k a paycheck on big fires. Outside of fire season, they can do tree planting or fuel reduction and can make good impressions and get hired by DNR or other partners. Once they are out, if they prove themselves on a line, they can join transition fire crews and become line bosses or machinery bosses for the state. I think it has a much better outcome than California's programs. You can check out the Sustainability in Prisons Project for more info and to donate to help support more opportunities for incarcerated people.",,Reddit

I‚Äôm in California. My cousin‚Äòs husband is a firefighter on the front lines. Somebody literally asked him the other day because he is a captain so he knows this kind of stuff. They asked him if an inmate who they have out there helping to fight these fires after their released wants to apply he said because they have helped and trained and stuff this expunges a lot of stuff off their record. Absolutely they can apply and it will show that they were on these fires as an inmate helping they will get hired so whoever is putting it out there that it‚Äôs illegal to hire an ex inmate is absolute false as longas they have proof and have shown that they were trained and an active fire and expunges their record and they can absolutely apply and try and get hired,,Reddit

"Con crews great guys and dam fine cooks, great to see them be represented in such a unfortunate time.

And there has been a mass exodus due to terrible wages, no housing, and people who jump out of planes losing healthcare. It is an incredibly gut wrenching seeing California deal with incredible fallout and for the harrowing actions first responders and the residents are dealing with. But this isn‚Äôt solely about California but the west at large. It is our responsibility in living so close to natural beauty to be the stewards of this land and to protect the people and places we love. From all the mismanagement finger pointing that has happened since the beginning of these fires ,there are people like this who are incredibly proud to be apart of their community and to put their lives in danger. To do their job for the community and for each other. So if you find the time look into the forestry technician world of the forest service, the failure of the Tim hart act ,and governments failure to those who fight fires.

They're good workers, and although this is a pilot program, Ed ""Balls of Steel"" Pulaski and the forest service were one of the first to open the jails and let inmates fight fires as back as 1910. Which gets briefly talked about in [The big burn](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Burn-Teddy-Roosevelt-America/dp/0547394608). They had 2 weeks of training back then, and had inmates, firefighters, and the national guard working together in 1910. Very American.

My first year in fire, one of my supervisors came from what he affectionately called a ""chain gang"". Good dude, one of my spirit animals along with Teddy Roosevelt, and Rosa Portos. So, they are getting employed. But there are so many different firefighting agencies that it's possible they're not getting employed everywhere.

"I got a cdl in prison and I've been out for 3 years. Texas prisoners aren't paid anything at all but there's enough guys willing to work just to get out of the dorm that they don't even need to consider it.  If every inmate in texas decided not to go to work one day, the entire system would collapse but it would be the inmates who suffer. No clean clothes. No hot meals(poor meals that they can be). Even filthier conditions. Prisoners keep texas prisons running and in many cases turning a profit.",,Reddit
"The term ""firefighter"" is a very broad descriptor.  What these guys do IS a valid and useful thing, but it is NOT THE SAME as being in FDLA etc.  They are paid less mainly because the system is taking advantage of incarcerated persons as cheap labor, but also because the service they provide is not as valuable as municipal firefighters.  The training is different, the equipment is different.  It is NOT the same.  

Here's an analogy.    A MacBook Pro is a high end powerful ""computer"", a MacBook Air is a high end decent ""computer""  The value of these two things are not the same even though they are both ""computers""

  
Bravo to these guys, and yes I absolutely hope it leads to them turning their lives around and grants them opportunities that they would not have had without what they are doing.   But it's not the keys to the city.",,Reddit

There should be more like this, other different professions, offered to those in prison as part of their rehabilitation.",,Reddit

Prison is fucking miserable, if life here outside of prison is hard, imagine how much harder it is being inside there with the worst of the worst. These guys are not dumb, they know $5 ain‚Äôt shit but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than being back in prison. So it just angers me that he‚Äôs standing there and trying to drop these ‚Äútruth bombs‚Äù to these guys. It‚Äôs like going to a McDonald‚Äôs worker and being like ‚ÄúTHEY ARE USING YOU!

The firefighting they are training to do and are doing on the fire line is definitely wildland firefighting and not firefighting in a traditional since like you have in the city fire department. All you have to do is Google Ventura training center and you will see a ton of results showing how many of these former inmate firefighters have been hired so I‚Äôm not sure where everyone is saying it is impossible or that nobody gets a second chance.",,Reddit

Dude in the glasses seemed like he was trying to lead these guys by the nose but they kept bringing up their gratitude instead.

And this is California where their relatively progressive. In the south and like Arizona you don't get paid shit. You work if you're in prison it's not an option. In Alabama you are literally a slave. It's in the constitution, the anti-slavery amendment has a carve out for incarcerated people. It's legal slavery. 

So yeah it's pretty bad in California but there are a hell of a lot worse states to get caught being a criminal in.

"White sweatshirt girl is a great example of why some crises could be prevented/lessened by a good person who is nearby, but often aren't.

One man looked at this situation, said ""this ride needs weight on the front side to stop from falling over"", and stepped up. White shirt girl sees the ride, and sees the man, and even takes a step towards helping but then STOPS! Only once she sees 2 or 3 other people rush to help right after she stopped herself does she join the effort. And then, of course, another dozen or two people jump in very quickly.

This is the Denial/Delay moment that we all must prepare for at the start of a crisis. Rides, built by engineers and maintained by staff, do not *normally* fail and crash and hurt people. Because this type of scenario is not normal, we often find ourselves receiving evidence that things are not normal but disregard or question it as our first reaction. This woman saw that people needed help but physically stopped herself from providing it until she got the validation that it wasn't her misreading things, or one cooky guy playing hero when it isn't called for.

An example of the evidence being disregarded: On 9/11 it took an average of 6 minutes for interviewed survivors to begin evacuation (many finished an email, or gathered their things, spent time looking out the windows first, properly shut down their computers, etc). A shaking building, debris falling from higher floors, alarm systems blaring...these aren't normal. But we are more likely to believe that some reason we haven't considered that IS totally normal is the cause for this, because this building falling down is so incredibly abnormal that it simply CANT be happening.

Last time I was at a carnival, IN THE SAME DAY:

1) The zipper broke while my friends were on it. Spewing smoke out the back, fortunately they were able to get everyone off the ride with no incident. 

2) One of the teacups came loose and tipped over. Unclear if someone was on it at the time.

This was at the Topsfield fair in Topsfield, MA like 3 years ago",,Reddit

I clutched the bottom of the seat and bar as tightly together as I could for the rest of the ride. 

When I got off and we told the carny, he laughed.",,Reddit

This exact situation happened to me as a child in the 90's on one of those swing rides. The entire ride started tipping over midway through and people jumped on to stop it. Couldn't really stop the swings themselves from hitting each other/the center pole. I steer clear of carnival rides. No thanks.,,Reddit

"Find the helpers, and join them!",,Reddit
"Not a very similar ride, but an injury nonetheless. I rode a ride called ‚ÄòThe Himalayas‚Äô from my local city‚Äôs former theme park. Was one of my favorite rides and I always went on it. Like a really fast circular-loop pattern ride and it went through like a colorful ice cave with fanatsy themed paintings with cool music. Anyway, the bars autoengaged before and after the ride and the staff would tell you to remain still while it occurred. We went once when I was a young child around 2000 and had ridden as per usual to satisfy me. As we got off, our cart safety bars didn‚Äôt quite lift the first time and they had to keep attempting to release the bar. Finally it did but it also had busted me square in the face. Blood immediately, ripped my eyelid apart. Had to get two stitches. Not a fun time. We did get refunds of our tickets, and a free pass that summer that my mother ironically still used.",,Reddit
"There is a video from another angle.  In that video one can see it was not the person alone who decided to risk his safety. There were three people, one held the side closer to camera (farther side from this) and two of them went to hold the other closer end.  The three initially are NOT in the view of this camera when they walked together to help so it appears as if one guy came first and then others came.",,Reddit
Pikachu isn‚Äôt helpful at all,,Reddit
"Something like this happened at the state fair that happens not too far from where i live. There was a shout for help which made me and about 6 other guys whip around and we saw the flying carpet ride  starting to tip. So we ran over and hopped on it and pulled it back to the ground along with the one who yelled for help, and had to hold it there till they could get the ride shut down and unloaded.",,Reddit
They didn‚Äôt do anything. That ride slowed down enough before majority if the people got there.,,Reddit
what‚Äôs her @?,,Reddit
"As someone who used to be a carny, every ride at every spot was inspected by the fire chief and an inspector prior to first opening.

"I don't want to take away the courage from the first to the last who wanted to help... But it was really the structure by its own weight that returned to its original place. I work with metal structures that are much less heavy than this one and accidents due to believing that it can be stopped when they tip over are common. 

I insist on granting the courage that these people have earned, but if the structure had given a little more, there would be more injured people on the ground than on the ride.",,Reddit

Even if I said something I doubt they'd have listened to a mere k√¨d! Didn't hear about any accidents so, luckily, nothing bad happ√®ned.

If I remember right I read an article about this when it happened. The conductor had almost IMMEDIATLY shut off the ride but the thing weighs so much that this is AFTER turning the ride off.

"When I was in high school I worked at an amusement park and management really didn't care about the safety of anyone in that place. We were told that we had to keep the rides running until we were explicitly told not to, even in horrible weather etc. I remember it was raining one day and I was running this kiddie roller coaster, and was told not to shut it down yet. A woman and her daughter got on and I started the ride only for it to start slipping backwards as it started to climb up one of the incline. I just had to say fuck it and stopped the ride to get them off. 



The other stuff I saw there was crazy. I ran a ride that spun in circles and the height requirement was not at all accurate. There were a few times I had to stop that one because the kid just barely made the height requirement, and they were riding solo, but I started to see them slip under the bar because they were so small as the ride picked up speed.

The same dude comes back and spins us around, does the same for other people on the ride. Out of the corner of my eye I see him coming back, walking past an empty spinning chair, and the bar must have got loose as it sprang up and hit him. 

I turn in his direction, he basically gets thrown across the ride, into a chain link fence. The ride stops and people are screaming and we run over to help him, but his body is facing down and his head is facing us. He's shaking like crazy but then the other workers wouldn't let us near him.

I also didn't know how to lock the pin myself but they missed that it wasn't locked when checking it.

They got the best form squid games taught me that,,Reddit
"8 men can lift 10 women easily, I think the key here is center of gravity and driving the feet.  This is exactly what they teach you in football; lower man wins. 

Lower center of gravity means shorter ‚Äúmoment arm‚Äù which is engineering term but think of the body as a lever, the longer the lever the easier it is to rotate it. 

Driving the feet is also I think increasing friction. Others in the comments are wrong that you want more feet and more area. You want more normal force so you want all your weight on one foot. One foot would have higher pounds per square inch on the ground. Obviously you can‚Äôt walk on one foot but if you alternate you‚Äôre getting the benefit.",,Reddit

"I've read the comments and see the number disparity is due to weight, but it's not making sense to me. They may weigh the same, but with 2 extra people, 4 extra feet to apply their weight and pull the rope. It seems to me they need to balance weight and number of participants.

A bit like a boxer weighing the same, but having a third arm kinda thing.",,Reddit
The amount of thigh in this video should please everyone,,Reddit
Powerful thighs,,Reddit
10w vs 8m no one els count?,,Reddit
Who won? Who lost? You decide!,,Reddit
It looks like the men simply aren't trying.,,Reddit
"If you had 2-200lb boxes and dragged each across a surface, but one box was rough on the bottom, the other smooth, the rough would be harder to pull due to friction. Likewise, having four more rubber shoes digging in on one side would seem to give an advantage, even with identical weights. I‚Äôm not a physics expert though so don‚Äôt quote me. :)",,Reddit
There are at least half as many more women.,,Reddit
"Do they put the chesty one in the front to distract the competitors?

I would not want to be anywhere near the middle of that rope like the ref. That stored energy in the rope would probably screw you up if you were too close when it snapped,,Reddit

There are more women pulling than men,,Reddit

Mens side has 2 less bodies lol",,Reddit
they are training not competing.,,Reddit
F=ma. The Taiwan team is accelerating with every coordinated step backwards. The Thai team are not moving at all.,,Reddit

8 vs 10.  Do each side have the same total mass?,,Reddit

Yeah ots also 10 vs 8,,Reddit
why are there more women than men¬†,,Reddit
The math doesn‚Äôt add up,,Reddit
Weight based or just Biased towards the women? we can do blah blah ?,,Reddit
There were 10 women and only 8 men,,Reddit
The women have 2 extra on their side vs the men. 10v8,,Reddit
Why is there so few men compared to the women,,Reddit
So wait how many woman are there? I count 8 dudes and like 10-11 women?,,Reddit
Proof. The women‚Äôs team needs 10 people to match the men‚Äôs 8.,,Reddit

10 women vs 8 men

Women *are* genetically smaller than men, meaning less mass, therefore less weight to use as strength, so yeah, if you get more women they‚Äôre going to win.

Women are generally lighter and more flexible, making them good at endurance sports and gymnastics, even martial arts to a degree due to competition karate sparring being about speed and competition karate Kata being about control and accuracy. We should pride women on what they‚Äôre good at, not get them to outnumber some men so they can pretend to be good at something they‚Äôre genetically worse at.

I don‚Äôt see why we always try to pit men vs women in a ‚Äúwho is better‚Äù contest when both sexes have clear strengths and weaknesses.",,Reddit

Edit 2: its not about china specifically guys‚Ä¶ I was making a comment about excess and the state of our planet. Everyone is getting hung up on the fact that its china. Never mind the huge personal pool in a state with frequent water restrictions.",,Reddit
Go find the pool with all the gtx 5090,,Reddit
Hopefully she packed the silverware¬†,,Reddit
"And when she passes away, her children will donate all this to goodwill",,Reddit
Not a bad idea but might have been a better idea to put them on the deep end incase the pool gets used as a water resource.,,Reddit
She should join politics . O lady u deserve to be our leader .,,Reddit
I can‚Äôt figure what someone needs 5 sets of fine China for. They must have some pretty huge parties,,Reddit
Hopefully she survived. She can host a tea-pool party when she comes back.,,Reddit
"For people asking about the furniture, you‚Äôre supposed to move everything flammable especially furniture either inside or away from the house",,Reddit
Oh the humanity‚Ä¶,,Reddit
That's so clever!!,,Reddit
How many times is this going to get posted today?,,Reddit
To save you guys wondering her house was too big to fit in pool,,Reddit
I‚Äôve already seen this image three times this week with different ‚Äústories‚Äù.,,Reddit
They‚Äôre probably family heirlooms and bring back memories. I remember my grandmas china and it‚Äôs fun to use it when I‚Äôm home at my moms. It is sentimental.,,Reddit
"I don‚Äôt see why not. China is perfect for this. You can‚Äôt do this other valuables like electronics or fine furniture. They probably took photos, fine jewelry and documents with them.",,Reddit
The more remarkable thing is that someone still actually HAS China sets.,,Reddit
5 sets of fine china? Wow,,Reddit
I‚Äôd do this with my pc and large tv got a huge backlog of games and no apocalypse gunna stop me,,Reddit
Yep.  I‚Äôm definitely hoping that your fine china survives.,,Reddit
