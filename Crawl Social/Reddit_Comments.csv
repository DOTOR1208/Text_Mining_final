**Spicy** chew toy!,POSITIVE,Reddit
Wow - never thought a pet would be interested in anything like a battery or that they could cause a house fire.  Thankfully they appear to be safe.,POSITIVE,Reddit
"It‚Äôs amazing to see the dogs know this is a bad situation. They stood there and fretted over it, like a child would do.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

"That is very much indeed, not, a good boy.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"I really want to get a dog but man, videos like these really make me think twice.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
Amazing how slow the dog bed burned compared to that couch.  The shit in couches is often hella flamable.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"It's fairly impressive how slowly the mattress burns,  they must not have removed the tag",POSITIVE,Reddit
"That brief moment where they both just stand there watching it.

""We are literally three dogs and a cat. What the hell do we do about this?""",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"My first reaction is ‚Äúwow the owners are dumb for leaving that where the dog could get it,‚Äù but then in thinking about it a little more, it would never occur to me either that a dog might grab one of those to chew on.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"Look at that little Dennis the menace at the end, wagging his tail and following the fireman like nothing happened!",NEGATIVE,Reddit
My cat would never do this‚Ä¶just saying.,POSITIVE,Reddit
Kennels are magical if you‚Äôre not home.,POSITIVE,Reddit
Did the cat make it? Did not see it after it ran.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"Dreadful for the homeowners, but there's something almost cute about the way they stand and stare at the fire for a minute or two. ""Well, this is *new*"".

Personally I wouldn't blame the owners, or say the dogs should have been crated. Like this is a one in a million thing. Sometimes shit just happens.",POSITIVE,Reddit
Good boy barked at the fire! Done all he could,NEGATIVE,Reddit
Would an insurance cover this?,NEGATIVE,Reddit

How does a dog get their mouth on a bare lithium-ion battery? That should be in a garage or shed and definitely not in reach of a dog.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
This is why you need cats that boop cups of water off tables,NEGATIVE,Reddit
I am surprised barking at the fire did not extinguish it. /s,NEGATIVE,Reddit
Everyone‚Äôs talking about the dogs but what about the cat? Did the cat get out?,NEGATIVE,Reddit
This reminded me of how my Sims reacted to a house fire‚Ä¶ especially the way it‚Äôs fast forwarded,POSITIVE,Reddit
This is one of my worst fears. I move all remotes and battery operated things onto a shelf when I leave my dog alone because he has a something against battery operated things for some reason when he is left alone. Doesn‚Äôt go for anything else but if it uses a battery and he can get to it he will try to destroy it.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
They can make fire now *Gasp they're evolving,POSITIVE,Reddit

who the heck left it there,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"First of all, why he chew freaking battery?",NEGATIVE,Reddit
I think he was genuinely thinking how to I hide this from my owner lol,NEGATIVE,Reddit
What‚Äôs the whole story here? How were authorities alerted of the fire? It seems like nobody was home? Or maybe there was and the video skipped that part?,NEGATIVE,Reddit
Everyday I keep learning things to keep away once I get a dog,POSITIVE,Reddit
"I like how the cat ran away first, ducked for cover behind the couch, then made its escape. Quicker thinking than the dogs.",POSITIVE,Reddit
"Man, the story here is how well that fire-retardant material in the dog beds held up! That fire took forever to consume the dog beds; it was only when it skipped to the couch that things got real.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

"Omg I‚Äôm so glad the dogs are okay.

‚ÄúWe were just chilling on our beds and all of a sudden the bed just lit on fire, I swear!‚Äù",POSITIVE,Reddit
His bite was worse than his bark,NEGATIVE,Reddit
Biggest reason I kennel my dog when I‚Äôm away. It has a door to the outside. I had my dog eat my passport and cash before a trip .,NEGATIVE,Reddit
And he never chewed anything ever again‚Ä¶. Just kidding. He won't make that connection.,NEGATIVE,Reddit

The owners are idiots. That's why you keep things up and away from your dogs.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
That's why you get a cat.,POSITIVE,Reddit
i think reading my dog the manufacturer guidelines wont help..,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"Oh man, I knew I shouldn't have bought a l-ion battery for my dog as a chew toy. He just likes it so much.",POSITIVE,Reddit
Come home from a hard day of work and find out your dog burnt your house down.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"I really fucking hope we find a way to make batteries that are not only better than the ones we have today, as battery tech has only minimally advanced since the creation of lithium-ion batteries, turns out it's really hard to store energy. But also, I really hope the next great leap forward in battery tech makes them less flammable. That may be too much to ask for, but I really hope so. Lithium-ion battery fires are insanely scary and dangerous.

Until science & engineering catches up, what we *really* need is fucking legislation that forces manufacturers to make (virtually) all products to have replaceable batteries. When Lithium-ion batteries sit too long they can swell, and if they get punctured they will start a fire. 

I absolutely go out of my way to avoid 95% of products that have lithium-ion batteries that I can't replace. In fact, I plan on buying a wireless headset soon, and the only one I am even considering is the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless from Steel Series because it is the only wireless headset on the market that actually has replaceable batteries.

Same thing with my mouse. I currently can't use a wired mouse, and I want a mouse with more buttons on it, so I searched around and found ones that take AA batteries instead of ones that have stupid unreplaceable lithium-ion batteries.

Even ignoring fire concerns, batteries wear over time and by their nature, deplete in charge. If I want to keep using my device without it plugged in, or just want to replace an old battery in a device I am likely spending a decent chunk of change on, I should be able to replace it as easily as possible.

I can't fucking wait until our government actually catches up and gives us good right to repair and consumer protection laws.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"Idk why crate training is being hated on in this thread, if you properly exercise your dog, or hire a dog walker to come while you're at work, being crated when alone is safe. A big enough crate will allow the dog to spin around and move a bit as well. Of course it's not ideal or perfect, but it will keep your dog safe. I've been a dog walker for people who've had to crate their dogs when working. Dog was fine and happy.",POSITIVE,Reddit
"Still, 10 out of 10 dog. Would pet",NEGATIVE,Reddit
When they make those beds flame retardant they don't fuck about. That burned for ages before it really went up.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
They saved the dogs but did they save the black cat?? Or did I miss them showing it??,NEGATIVE,Reddit
I sure hope that the fire department gave a strong speech to the dog about chewing batteries.,POSITIVE,Reddit
Dog was outside at the end like ‚ÄúI have no idea what happened!‚Äù,NEGATIVE,Reddit
Straight to dog jail,NEGATIVE,Reddit
This really wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if battery disposal bins were placed in every store. I live just north of a small town and we have only one store that has a battery disposal bin and only then it‚Äôs labeled ‚Äúrechargeable battery bin‚Äù adding to more confusion‚Ä¶,NEGATIVE,Reddit

"I don't know what the outcome was here in terms of total damage to the wider property but it's a testament to fire retardant fabrics that the fire didn't grow quicker than it did, that mattress kept it contained longer than I'd have expected.

I can only think how our ancestors discovered fire via lightning,POSITIVE,Reddit
"I'm more worried about the homeowners. That's a lot of damage, burnt stuff. And the comments say insurance won't cover it either due to the ""act of dog"" clause. Having a house fire in this economy of all time is rough.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
Interesting to see how long the dog beds held up before they gave up and got consumed in seconds. Probably some foam in there which I believe is usually done with some kind of flame retardant. If it was just a cigarette or a candle falling down it probably wouldn't have spread.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
I can't imagine the creative way their insurance company is going to try and get out of this one. That breed of dog was not listed as being present within the premise in which case violates the terms of the policy. Dogs that chew lithium ion batteries are not covered.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"This might be a stupid question, but are cats strong enough to crack open a battery like this dog did? We don‚Äôt have dogs but we do have three cats.

"Ffs, use crates. As long as there‚Äôs no confinement fear and you‚Äôre not gone more than 3-5 hours, it‚Äôs safer. At the very least, do it for dogs that chew/get into stuff.

"As a firefighter, they aren't actually putting out the fire here. You use hydraulic ventilation (as we call it) only once the fire has been knocked down, or there is someone ready inside who needs visibility asap.

The firefighters are using a pole with a hook at the end and a nozzle. They insert the hook into the building so that the nozzle is close to being flush with the outside of the window. When they pull the trigger to release the water, they use a cone setting on the nozzle, the water, being in that wide cone shape, is drawing out the oxygen inside the building, while at the same time preventing oxygen from entering into the building effectively extinguishing the flames.

Positive Pressure Ventilation is cool but can make the fire sprint. And when you're on the nozzle, it's not just water ‚Äì you're playing with air pressures. Bernoulli's Principle is the science, saying fast fluid flow creates low pressure, pulling more air in. It's clutch for tight-space firefighting or blasting water into a building from outside.

There is a rotating vortex in the base* that pushes air through slots along the edges of the oval ring (the part you see) and in doing so it creates a low pressure ~ that induces the air behind the pull through.  It‚Äôs called ***entrainment*** and by exploiting this aspect of Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle, Dyson can achieve up to 15 times the air flow of traditional fan blades!

"For those actually curious what this principle is, he discovered that the faster a fluid (gas or liquid) moves, the less pressure it has. It is one of the two ways a wing produces lift (thanks to the airfoil shape, the air over the top travels longer, and therefore faster) [the other way a wing produces lift is by the angle of attack (Newtons conservation of energy) meaning because it pushes air down, it produces lift {and drag}]
The way it is used here is very smart and I've never seen it before, so I don't want to try to explain it and possibly get it wrong. It has been used in carburators to mix the gasoline and air by passing the air through a smaller pipe, speeding it up, sucking the gasoline into it.",POSITIVE,Reddit

One of our fire department officers discovered the hydrovent.us website on YouTube. The officer suggested manufacturing a similar suppression pipe. In good cooperation with the Central Ostrobothnia and Pietarsaari region's fire department, we developed a suppression pipe suitable for our conditions.

I'm so jealous of the magnificent nature you have in your country, I saw so many beautiful sights! Please treasure it.
I disagree with the low quality food, I had both really good meals and really poor ones. Best Thai food I ever had was in LA.
Also, so many places sell drip coffee just the way I like it, not some watered down espressos. Loved that!
Another like were the many (mostly) clean and free restrooms, Having to pay for using a dirty restroom in a rest area along the highway in Europe sucks. That being said, some restrooms in the US really didn't care about my privacy with one inch gaps everywhere.
Driving was so convenient, being a pedestrian not so much. I biked through SF but couldn't say I felt very safe.

Dislikes were the tipping culture and prices listed pre-tax. I mean, I ordered food or drinks to go a couple of times where I often had to tip in advance only for something to go wrong with my order. Not getting my tip back am I?

Dislike: tipping (I know you have it already but seriously what gives), treatment of indigenous history, lack of consumer protection, level of poverty, strange policy making that reinforces lack of trust in government, occasional respect for road rules, hard to access to good quality produce at a reasonable price, no ring-pulls on tinned food.

I just got back from France yesterday and it was the first time I‚Äôve been to Europe since pre Covid. Before Covid a lot of places didn‚Äôt even do food ‚Äúto-go‚Äù. That seems to have changed. 

I do love having fresh baked bread and cheese for breakfast. Yogurt is also much better in Europe, I don‚Äôt know how the us sucks so hard at yogurt. It really is terrible here. I also can‚Äôt drink American orange juice anymore since having OJ in Europe. 

I just got back from France where we rented a car and drove in Paris. I could not believe how hard it was to see the stop lights, but thought they were in that position to help drivers see pedestrians- that is a really big problem in the Us, not sure how big of an issue it is in the EU.

"Having lived in both for two years, here's my take on both. In Europe I lived in Germany, but travelled around the neighboring countries a bit and now I live in VA. I'm also speaking as a student with limited income lol. I'm mostly writing about what I like, as it what I dislike contrasts pretty well with the other (i.e what I love about Europe I grow to appreciate even more in relation to my time in the US, and vice versa).

Europe
Love
-Public transport, bikes and walking. I don't have a car, but that was never a problem in Europe. I could get anywhere I wanted to pretty feasibly and in good time.

-Healthier food options. I felt so energized my whole time living there, and when I come back, because I feel like I'm eating simpler and healthier most days. I'm Southeast Asian, so it did take a while before I got used to simple foods (like cold cuts, cheese and bread for meals), but I do miss eating that minimally every now and then.

-Prices. Now, it might just be where I live in both, but I found Europe a lot more affordable than the US. Granted, I only had to worry about buying food and going out, but still, I find myself a lot more conscious about my spending when I was in the US. 

-Safety. I felt a lot safer in Europe than the US. As a student in both, gun violence is one difference, yeah, but even then in cities in Europe I felt that there were always all sorts of people (especially women and the elderly) around even in the early morning by themselves, which made me feel that if locals thought it was safe, then I felt safer. Whereas in the US, in large cities, I often have locals warn me about certain areas, especially at night. Fortunately I've never had incidents in either country, but still.

-LGBT life. Speaking as a gay person, Europe has more options. I feel safe in most places in both, especially with friends around, but I feel that European cities had more diverse and um... Liberated venues, so to speak. Which I'm a fan of. 

US:
-Friendly and open people. I actually think the Europe I saw was very friendly! But people in the US are next level friendly, and as an outgoing person myself, I really do enjoy that about being in the US. I often chat with people at stores, bars, in rideshares and around my college campus too, which I didn't get to experience as much in Europe (though that might also be the language barrier at play).

-More food diversity. I lived in two cities of comparable size in both, and even in other cities that are similarly large, I just think the US' history of migration has led it to evolve such a rich and diverse food culture. There're so many options for dining places. Again, not to say Europe didn't have options, but the US just has a lot more places that are also a lot more mixed at an accessible level. Tipping still sucks though, but I still make sure to tip as well as I could. Just because I disagree with the conditions that led to tipping doesn't give me the right to screw over my server. 

-Speaking of diversity, the US definitely feels more diverse as a whole, even outside of large cities. I get along with most people, but there's a quicker level of connection I'm able to get with US PoC for some reason that I didn't feel as much in Europe.

Even though I have more things listed that I like in Europe, I really do enjoy both for their own merits! Didn't expect my comment to be this long though",POSITIVE,Reddit
"Nice to get your perspective. Considering the reputation Holland has for being, well, ahem‚Ä¶ ‚Äúmoney focused‚Äù let‚Äôs say, it‚Äôs really surprising to me that the Dutch aren‚Äôt asking for to-go boxes for every scrap of food they don‚Äôt finish during a meal. 

Enjoyed your notes and it‚Äôs nice to see a post that is not looking to just stir the pot. 

I will offer one criticism: it‚Äôs almost impossible to categorically define American food. It is true that a lot of it is absolutely packed with sugar and is highly processed. But I live in a part of the country where I can (and do) access nothing but very, very fresh fruits, vegetables, high quality baked goods, cheeses, beers and wines, etc.",POSITIVE,Reddit
"One major disagreement: There is a lot of really good cheese produced in this country. Especially Cheddar-style cheese from Vermont and Wisconsin. There is also some very good goat cheese. The rest of the cheese, you are right, it's mostly pretty terrible.

I think you had a very small sample size on your recent visit. For example, only the really cheap hotels use paper plates and plastic cutlery. If you chose to visit the cheapest hotels, that is biasing your sample.

The rest is just what you are habituated to. A typical American visiting Europe would think it's really bizarre to eat cold sliced meat at breakfast. We expect hot meats and freshly cooked eggs. When I visit Europe it's amazing to have 3 or 4 different types of fresh bread and 3-4 meats and cheeses, but it's not what we're used to.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

Admittedly it was a short trip and maybe I did it wrong, but the closest thing to being able to just wander around was in downtown, and even there you occasionally have to walk over a nice 8 lane highway, which is a long way to walk (and be wary of certain neighborhoods and whatever).

I also understand that just because Americans are generally friendly on the surface it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre shallow or we make friends faster than Europeans ‚Äî there‚Äôs just less daily friction in our interactions.

Food can be great here (even breakfast) but you have to know where to go and what to look for. Vermont, New York and Wisconsin make some stellar cheese, but again it takes some effort.

"Good analysis. But mate, if you‚Äôre not enjoying breakfast in the US, you‚Äôre definitely going wrong. 

Breakfast is one of the things I missed most while living in Europe. Bacon, omelettes, lox, sausage, beef brisket and egg tacos, low key diners, high end brunch spots ‚Äî the list is literally endless. 

The variety of breakfast is one thing that the US absolutely shits on Europe. When I lived in Italy and Hungary, or traveling to most any of 27 countries ‚Äî it was always a pastry, sliced meats, and espresso/cappuccino.

Tipping:  Yeah its a pain, but in my mind I am always calculating price and 20+%.  I would love for workers to be paid more, but that isn't going to happen.  PS I also tip in Europe.  No one has refused my tip. 

Food:  We have a different breakfast culture.  Most regular folks do not eat like they would at a hotel for breakfast.  Egg and toast is pretty much it at my house.  Dinner is another story.   There is a lot of variety depending on where you are, though as a tourist I do not blame you for straying into too many local restaurants.

And y'all need to air condition more buildings with the way the climate has been heading.  

Oh and one big thing the Netherlands does right is bike lanes.  I love how (in Amsterdam at least) there were lanes for cars that had actual small physical barriers to the bike lanes and the bikes were separated from the pedestrians as well.

Yeah - the tipping. Gotta say I enjoyed and enjoy tipping waiters in restaurants growing up and a couple of other tipping rituals: mailman/barber/cabs.

I don‚Äôt have to tip of course but I find it reprehensible that I‚Äôm even asked. I can‚Äôt get a thank you - a your welcome - or a kind smile - but I‚Äôm expected to tip you and your business for handing me a $6 croissant. Again - culturally - the tipping I grew up on put a minimal dent to my own economic life and it - looking back - was a worthwhile exchange. Nowadays I don‚Äôt even want to go out as it‚Äôs stifling to see 18%. 20% 25%. Also with increase in tip suggestions I find customer service horrendous.

Thought I‚Äôd reply with my 2 cents as an American tourist in the Netherlands:

Pros:

Amsterdam is a beautiful city. I thought the architecture in Amsterdam was too notch. The city was pretty clean and felt safe too!

Fresh and tasty food everywhere! Maybe this is just my perception from my recent experience but every meal we ate seemed like it was made from fresh ingredients. Made everything seem that much more tasty. Especially the cheese!

The walkability. A 30 minute walk in Amsterdam city center was nothing. If anything it was a delight walking past tiny cafes and beautiful buildings. In the US a 30 minute walk is a no go almost anywhere. A 30 minute walk in Texas means your walking along major roads and under/over freeway overpasses. 

Tipping was totally not expected! Anytime I did tip the servers in NL were genuinely grateful. Unlike the US where if you don‚Äôt tip it‚Äôs viewed very negatively. 

Lots of really cool things to do. From museums, to river cruises, and Coffee shops. Need I say more?

Cons: 

Taxi drivers try to take advantage of you. Maybe this is the same in the US but I don‚Äôt ever use taxis here. In Amsterdam I tried approaching taxi drivers and they almost always made up some kind of excuse like ‚Äúminimum payment is ‚Ç¨40 regardless of distance‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can only take you this far, you have to walk the rest‚Äù. I learned to just use uber while I was there

Hard to find gluten free food! I have celiac disease so I have to eat gluten free. Not much of a problem if in the US for a number of reasons but in the Netherlands, restaurants rarely advertised gluten free options, had gluten free menus, or had any items on their menu that were gluten free. 

Can‚Äôt think of much else! Maybe just that it‚Äôs a little expensive. But I certainly thought the Netherlands was worth it!",POSITIVE,Reddit
"Where are you eating? It sounds like you're very much doing that part wrong.

That said, America *does* make it spectacularly easy to do it wrong, when it comes to food. There's just so much excess everywhere, I could totally understand how a tourist might not know what to get and what not to get.

But I've also spent a lot of time all over Europe, and while I really wound up appreciating the fact that good salads and vegetable-forward dishes were often the best options on the menu, I certainly wouldn't compare the variety of food options to the variety that can be found in major US cities.

With the exception of food in Italy and Hungary, the diversity and quality of dinner that one can find in major cities across the US tends to be far better (although one can find awful food, too)

One point I may add is that racism tends to be more common in Europe even if it's not as overt",NEGATIVE,Reddit

1. Lifestyle.  Paid time off, less work hours, more leisure time, more connections with neighbors.

5. Metric system ‚ù§Ô∏è

">Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.

This one is hard to disagree with. We Americans have *a lot* of nature and a lot of it is relatively untouched. Here in California where I live, it is somewhat easy to get to places in nature where you can look all over for any sign of human presence and not find it. I can hike for hours off trail without seeing another human or sign of anyone having been there. 

I've never experienced anything remotely close to this in Europe. As a matter of fact, I keep trying to just to see if it can be done. I assume it can, but it seems really tough. Almost always in the mountains you see a trail, a hut, an antenna or even places where someone has written their name by arranging the rocks in a meadow. 

On the other hand, I have to admit there is something special about hiking for a few hours to a nice refugio and having someone else cook for you and offer a glass of wine. :)

>People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.

I agree! Contrary to the myth of the rude American, I think people are quite friendly here. 

I do disagree with your comment about the Dutch being rude. I thought they were quite friendly, as well as the people in other European countries where I've travelled being friendly. It does seem like Europeans are less likely to engage or start a conversation with strangers, but I don't count that as being rude - I just think of it as a cultural difference. 

&#x200B;

>Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.

This is true, but it doesn't excite me too much. Except in the case of coffee. And if you travel to certain secret parts of the midwestern United States, you often get free beer refills. (Not officially, but it's quite common if you've had a couple of beers and order a third, the bartender will comp you).

>  
The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

I agree and love this one. I've always wondered why it is not more common in Europe.

>  
Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.

I feel like I'm agreeing with you too often, but this is another case of agreement. I think the tide is starting to turn on tipping in the US. At one point it seemed like an ok idea. An incentive for the server to provide good service. But tipping has gotten to high and we're not expected to tip for almost everything. And as far as incentives, a bad actor who does not tip will save themselves quite a bankroll over the course of a year.

&#x200B;

>The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.

Here I've got to disagree, with a few caveats. America is a really large and diverse place. I think if you go to cities like NYC, SF, LA and Chicago you will find food variety and quality to surpass anywhere in Europe. On the other hand if you go to anytown, USA, you'll have to search quite a bit among several bad options. 

We also have amazing cheese. I'm risking ruffling feathers here, but I think the cheese and beer in the US is as good, or in some cases better, than that in Europe. There, I said it. However, we also have lots of bad beer, and something that is very hard to find in Europe: bad cheese. America has a lot of so called ""commodity cheese"" in addition to the artisanal varieties produced in California, Wisconsin, Vermont and Oregon. 

&#x200B;

>Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.

Good observation. I agree. 

&#x200B;

>Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?

This one makes my blood boil. When I was a child, there was a movement to covert us young ones to using the metric system, but it never stuck. Not only is the metric system more intuitive with everything based on 10, it's also used almost everywhere in the world. 

A few of my own:

* I think the homelessness problem is much worse and how it's being handled is much worse in the US.
* It seems like there is much more tourist scamming and pickpocketing in Europe than in the US.
* Europe has better architecture and more walkable cities. There are some really ugly car based place in the US that are just strip malls and parking lots. These places do offer convenience, but I wish we had more of a balance. 
* I love how European cities still have a sense of history and connection with the past. Small museums and street musicians playing classical music are really nice.",POSITIVE,Reddit

"> Imperial measurements

Unfortunate circumstances from a failing economy in the 80s.

In the 70s the US passed legislation that would have put us fully in metric by the 90s. After about a decade, and billions of dollars spent, this was stopped during the Reagan administration due to budget cuts.

Fun fact, due to machinery made to be compliant with the metric initiative, and global operations, the US is largely metric in the industrial sense, and fully metric in sciences. Engineering is still mixed though, e.g., civil engineering designing highways is not metric, electrical and chemical engineering are all metric, mechanical is mixed depending on the application.

"Murrican here. Yes, tipping is a HUGE problem. Corporate america refuses to pay a fair, living wage, and so wants US, the consumer, to fork out more money to subsidize their wealth. They also have a lot of workers on welfare, making us pay even more, or again for something THEY should be paying for.
sugar has also grown from a fairly large problem to epidemic proportions. We assume it is a combo of food manufacturers wanting to make us all addicted to sugar and thus their product, and the health industry wanting more business and being willing to make us (or LET us) become more sick so they have more maladies to treat. NOT ONE doctor will tell you to cut down on sugar. Some dieticians will, but most people don't go to dieticians till they have really serious problems.
Plastic has really gotten out of hand. IF you order food to go, they will include plastic cutlery whether you ask for it or not. we REALLY need to get rid of as much as we can, but it is seen as a corporate issue and corporate america doesn't give a damn.

we tried to switch to metric several decades ago, and there was a LOT of pushback from a lot of businesses.  I assume they were measuring device manufacturers and construction related companies. Metric makes great sense to a lot of us, but it is unlikely our government will mandate it any time soon. we can't even get people to vaccinate like we did when i was a kid, and we felt we were being patriotic then.

"I won't really comment on the things you like because I feel like it would be hard to argue with any of those.

For the things you don't like:

1. 100% agree. Tipping culture in the US is completely out of hand as well as pricing. I would be all for moving towards an all-inclusive pricing system. That said, I do understand why tax is usually separate. It's a good reminder to know what you're paying in tax.
2. Food in the US is a travesty compared with the rest of the world, both in terms of quality and variety as you mention. Food standards in Europe are far higher than they are in the US an the ease of access to fresh, healthy ingredients is just night and day. To be honest, I don't even eat breakfast 90% of the time. That 10% where I do is comp breakfast at hotels.
3. The plastic industry is big. I don't like it, primarily from a health/toxin point of view. Where practical I much prefer paper and glass products. That said, I'll go to my grave using plastic straws. I've tried every alternative and they all suck. Plastic has its place in certain things.
4. This doesn't bother me. I know both systems well and can easily flip back and fourth between the two.

What types of restaurants did you go to? There is a MAJOR difference between some rural mom n pop place and some big city chain.

Yes i agree we all use too much single use plastic.

* Even with the prior point, tourist/convenient food is hit or miss in either continent. I've found amazing restaurants and cafes by spending time researching what's good in both places. McDonald's is disappointing no matter where you are in the world.
* Public transport in the EU is light years ahead of the US. The Metro, London Underground, and the Eurail make getting around much more convenient and less stressful than dealing with traffic. I did not encounter any strikes, which may have changed my opinion, although the trains in Italy were less than timely -- by a lot.

"""American cheese is the best cheese for a cheeseburger because it melts without splitting."" -Chef Slowik (The Menu)

But as far as food in the US, you really need to be able to find the right places to get fresh foods cooked the right way. If you are traveling extensively, that is very hard to do, especially since most Americans don't even look for that when they are getting breakfast or lunch. I've cooked and served at a lot of places in Georgia and Minnesota, and the majority of places will rely on preserved food if you don't want a high check and high tip. Tipping, yes, it's a hassle. Focus on what that person does for you. Having served plenty of places, I don't expect a tip above 10%/15% unless I have guided a table through their dining experience. But don't feel bad about tipping poorly (especially since you are from europe and most americans expect you to tip poorly). In most places, servers do well and expect other people to make up for the bad tips you get. Have a good trip!",NEGATIVE,Reddit

Idea is traffic light being closer is to focus on pedestrians being the main thing. Not the car or traffic flow. There is roundabouts for flow management so if there is a light near by that is mostly a pedestrian crossing nearby

In states it is for car flow. Wast amount of space on roads as well. There is stop signs for pedestrian areas so if there is light nearby make sure to look bit further including the lights.

"[Here](https://x.com/Justin_Br0nk/status/1872226113658949937) is a video of it in flight.

According to [here](https://aviationweek.com/defense/new-chinese-advanced-combat-aircraft-emerge-flight):

> Steve Trimble December 26, 2024

> New Chinese combat aircraft broke cover in a flood of social media photos and videos on Dec. 26 showing them in flight and revealing two new examples of China‚Äôs evolution as an aerospace innovator.

> One new aircraft appeared in social media posts revealing a large, three-engine warplane with a cockpit and diamond-style wing with no vertical tails. Yaw control appears to be managed by Northrop Grumman B-2-style split rudders.

> The engines are fed by a single dorsal inlet and two ventral inlets, the latter using caret-shaped intakes. The dorsal inlet features a stealth-enhancing diverterless supersonic inlet, but not the ventral inlets.

> The aircraft‚Äôs large ventral fuselage section likely provides room for an internal weapons bay. The main landing gear features two wheels each, a hallmark of heavy fighter-bombers, such as the Sukhoi Su-34.

> The apparent test flight over a populated Chinese area included appearances by a Chengdu-manufactured J-20S fighter, possibly flying a chase mission.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs size and arrangement tentatively suggests that this is the long awaited J/H-XX ‚Äòregional bomber‚Äô, designed to provide a low observable high altitude precision strike capability against bases and possibly ships throughout the Indo-Pacific,‚Äù said Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for Airpower and Technology at the Royal United Services Institute. ‚ÄúHowever, it remains possible that this prototype represents China‚Äôs known 6th Generation fighter program.‚Äù

> Hours later, further social media posts revealed images and video of a second new Chinese combat aircraft, also in flight test. 

> The images show a more traditional fighter design with a cranked arrow planform and possibly folding tailfins. It was not immediately clear when these images were captured, but one post marked the picture with a Dec. 22, 2024 time-stamp.

> The mystery warplanes emerged on the 13th anniversary of the roll-out of the J-20 stealth fighter, which itself came 13 years after the first flight of the Chengdu-made J-10 in March, 1998. The Dec. 26 date marks the 131st birthday of Mao Zedong, the late founder of the Chinese Communist Party.

> The role each of the aircraft would perform is not immediately apparent. No Chinese government or industry channel has acknowledged the imagery on official channels, but there also appears little effort by internal security services to censor the content posted by dozens of people on the ground.

> China has been developing the H-20 long-range stealth bomber and the medium-range JH-XX fighter-bomber, according to the annual China Military Power Report published by the U.S. Defense Department. Chinese industry officials also have confirmed that work is underway on a sixth-generation fighter.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

You don't think they've got a massive industrial base and highly educated population (that is what, 5x larger than America's?)? 

Now I'm not saying their military is at technological parity with America, but I wouldn't just bury my head in the sand and pretend that China is not catching up and maybe even surpassing in some areas.

Also, they don't really need to beat us in a conventional war.  What happens when things heat up and China says ""Ok, exports stopped"". Ya, it will hurt their economy, but it will devastate ours.  Americans won't know what to do when we no longer have access to our cheap goods.    
China will just be able to keep making everything domestically - we have no factories, we have no skilled engineers.

"Heat the dent with a hairdryer until it's warm to the touch. For small dents, skip this step and start at step 3.

Suction the dent outward using a dent puller. The goal is to make the dent smaller, not eliminate it completely.

Wipe the metal with a microfiber towel. If you're repairing a small metal dent, start at this step.

Prepare to use the bridge puller. To use this tool, you glue a bolt (known as a head) to the deepest point of the dent, use it to pull the dent out and later remove it. The first step is to apply the glue that came in your repair kit to the deepest point of the dent.

Attach the bridge puller head. Push it into the glue and allow it to cool for the time indicated in the directions. Usually, that's about 4-8 minutes.

Use the bridge puller. When the glue is completely dry, attach the bridge puller and turn the dial to slowly move the metal. Stop when the dent is gone and the metal is in its original position.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"That's not medieval armor, that's early modern plate armor designed specifically to withstand a (early modern) musket ball. You can tell it's not medieval by the fact that it has a ridged spine down the front and extends all the way down to the pelvis. The ridge is primarily there to provide a glancing surface for a lead ball, but also serves to be a point of great strength if a lead ball hits it dead on. Medieval plate armor has a more globular shape in the chest area and tapered in around the midsection, giving the wearer an hourglass figure.",POSITIVE,Reddit
"Slightly misleading title, but I assume you just found the clip and don't know where it comes from. 

So, in this little documentary, they are testing out armour plating of various periods and how the Renaissance era soldiery adapted to the arrival of the gunpowder weaponry. Before this clip, they fire at the standard late period (1300-1400) medieval armour, and the ball basically goes straight through it and embed itself in the dummy. This clip is when they applied a special type of plate over the top of the standard armour. Commonly, this was purchased by nobles and was even equipped on ground infantry if they served a particularly wealthy lord. As you can see, the round hits and then flattens. Is actaully rather incredible if you think about it. 

Many nobles beleaved that the gunpowder weapons were a fad that were too slow to fire and impractical...... that was until they got better, and the musket came along. Also, very intelligent people realised that the shortcomings of the weapons could be mitgated by simply applying more on mass, plus you can stick a pointy bit at the end and now you have the most common weapon on earth, a spear.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

It should also be noted that musket-proof armour is attested to in historical sources *but* it is expensive and could reasonably only be expected to find on wealthy cavalrymen. Several 16th century authors for this case argue that the common soldier shouldn't wear breastplates because they don't stop muskets and only serve to encumber the solider - counter-arguments from contemporary authors say that they're still good for melee fighting.

Anyway these armours would have some space in between the chest and the actual armour, meaning that an impact such as this would be diminished quite heavily and the person wearing the armour above would've been able to keep on fighting.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

"I had the pleasure of working with the Mexican Marines for a couple of month about a decade or so ago. They were incredibly professional and far more disciplined than we expected. We were training them on UXO/counter-IED doctrine, and to hear the extent to which the cartels have basically become ‚ÄúState Actors‚Äù was insane. They are far more sophisticated and capable than any terror group we‚Äôd had to deal with in the Middle East, except for maybe Hezbollah (which I had never personally had to interact with). They make standardized ordnance, possibly started the modern iteration of drone warfare, have heavy equipment, and legitimate training. 

But the Mexican Marines are very professional and in the first engagement we observed, the cartel (decked out sorta like professional militaries) broke contact and scattered, allowing the Marines to kill or detain most of them with no injuries. The cartel members breaking contact and scattering is not surprising, it‚Äôs the standard practice in asymmetric warfare, but the way the Marines were able to find them all in a rough environment was pretty cool to see. 

Maybe things have changed since the last time I was down there, but either way, I hope the best for Mexico and also hope U.S. policy can change because the cartels will never go away so long as the war on drugs exists.",POSITIVE,Reddit

"The thing is, this looks scary to people who don't know any better. If you showed this to a professional, they would immidately find about ten things about their gear that doesn't make sense. It's made purely to intimidate people who don't know any better.

For example, they're wearing tinted goggles at night, and it looks like they still have the sticker across the lenses. Not sure how that's gonna help you see better.

And also, instead of carrying extra magazines for their rifles, the guy opted to have a pistol where you'd usually carry your extra mags.

And also, those grenades on his chest are 40mm grenade launcher rounds, and he doesn't even have one on his loadout.

And the radios he has strapped to his knees, which will make running and movement in general very awkward.

In conclusion, these guys seem to have just ordered a bunch of airsoft gear from Temu to make themselves look like legit soldiers.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

He would make repeated trips to the Mexican border at Matamoros to get medication for his conditions, because there was too much red tape to get it back home, plus his disability payment was fuck all.  Eventually, it got out that he was a retired combat soldier, with *considerable* experience... He was approached by a farmer, to train his men to defend themselves.

"The crazy part is that $5.80 is after a recent raise in 2023. Before that it was $2.90.

And just for context this is a volunteer program. They are not forced to do this.

Edit - I want to clear up a few things. I'm not an LAFD employee, I'm a pilot. However I have 3 immediate family and 4 friends who are and this is the only thing I'm basing this off, yes word of mouth. 

1. This pay rate is per DAY not hour

2. Do they deserve more money imo? Yes they are in the danger zone.

3. These guys are volunteering to do this. They are trusted to go help society and are rewarded for it with time off sentence, time away from jail, better food etc. I applaud them.

4. They are in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM firefighters. They are support crew. They clear brush and other mundane tasks. Still can't disregard their service being in the hot spot.

5. Yes they are being exploited. Even if they got $20 an hour our county has no reason to hire regular fireman when they can do this. They are also not in duty all the time. They are activated only in times like this. Starting pay here is $100k. That's an easy $150k with OT. There was one notable fireman who made $750k last year.

6. This isn't BFE. LAFD is the leader. That's why the salary is so high, they want to attract top talent. Maybe elsewhere when there is an opening they get some applicants but here there are THOUSANDS.

7. Last thing and I'm sure I'm missing important things is yes I feel they are being exploited but without full info it's hard to paint a full picture.

Iirc, the state has only signed off on something like sixteen to twenty, since 2022.

"The problem is that the firefighting and many other parts of the economy are fundamentally reliant on prison labor. California incarcerates the highest number of people (both totally and per capita). This allows them to use prison labor for things they would ordinarily have to pay people a living wage for (like firefighting) or outsourcing the labor on a contract basis to private corporations. This creates a feedback loop that results in higher rates of incarceration. So sure, this program helps some inmates get back on track in life but it does even more damage by incentivizing a system where ordinarily high skilled and paid labor can be replaced with something that looks quite similar to modern day slavery.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

"Lol of course Hasan Piker is out here equating this program to slavery.

Brother, the biggest part of rehabilitation and preparing people for the real work upon release is getting them a job while they're in prison, so they can transfer those skills into the real world where they will receive real wage.

When you're incarcerated, you have your room, board, healthcare, and other services taken care of for you. So it's kind of disingenuous to compare incarcerated wages to that of a private citizen, as all of their income they earn at $5/h should be discretionary.

I'm confident the guys in this video will end up doing great in life once they're released, so long as they stick with the same or similar career path. Finding meaning is what keeps you from doing things that get locked up in the first place, as you don't want to lose all you've built.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

You see I'm not sure about this. I think this is tantamount to slavery and that these men aren't paid a fraction of what they should be getting.

"Ok that's a fair point, but why are we hearing it from terrorist sympathizer Hasan Picker?

EDIT: Nothing brings out uninformed political takes and whataboutisms like knocking Hasan so I guess I'll spell it out plainly.

1a. Attacking civilian ships or holding civilian hostages in order to affect a political end are both acts of terrorism. The Houthis have done both and continue to hold said hostages more than a year later. This is why the Houthis *easily* fit the label of ""terrorists"".

1b. No whataboutism about ""the IDF are terrorists too"" will ever change this or justify terrorism in any way.

1c. Hasan has [showed Houthi propaganda on stream](https://arazu.io/t3_1frphv2/?timeframe=all&category=hot) and justified the terroristic act of attacking the Galaxy Leader as a ""deterent"".

1d. It's also important to note that [Twitch explicitly forbids](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#5TerrorismandViolentExtremism) ""content that depicts, glorifies, encourages, or supports terrorism, or violent extremist actors or acts .... even for the purposes of denouncing such content"". Hasan doesn't denounce it though, as seen below.

2a. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the Gulf Cooperation Council (and their members Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and UAE), Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Estonia, Germany, Honduras, Israel, Kosovo, Lithuania, Paraguay, Serbia, Slovenia, the UK, the US, and Guatemala. The EU also considers the military wing a terrorist org.

2b. Here is a [list of Hezbollah's terrorist acts](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah). It includes 2011 support for Assad who has killed far more Muslims than Israel ever has. Civilian deaths at the hands of Assad's forces:

* The Syrian Network for Human Rights [estimates 201,234 civilian deaths](https://snhr.org/blog/2024/08/30/civilian-death-toll/).
* The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [estimates 164,223 civilian deaths](https://www.syriahr.com/en/328044/) (including 49,452 who died under torture).
* The Violations Documentation Center in Syria [estimated 111,016 deaths in 2020](https://vdc-sy.net/monthly-statistical-report-causalities-syria-november-2020/).

2c. Hasan [doesn't have an issue](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/left-wing-pundit-hasan-piker-says-i-dont-have-an-issue-with-hezbollah-praises-yemens-houthis-for-seizing-ships/) with Hezbollah. Why? Because (up until a while ago) they'd been ""pretty successful against Israel"".",NEGATIVE,Reddit

They get more freedoms in fire camp, better grub, more privileges than they would in a ‚Äúmain line‚Äù facility. Plus they get training in firefighting and build skills in other forestry disciplines such as trail building, tree planting, pre commercial thinning, not to mention the added benefit of adding to their self pride and self worth by helping people in need. There‚Äôs nothing more prideful than knowing you helped someone and/or saved their home, maybe their life. I got one guy on my crew who was in for 7 years total, the last 5 on an inmate fire crew.

For roughly 100 years until just a couple of years ago, Oregon had a 10-2 system. If you had the money to go to trial and 2 people say you are innocent then the courts still found you guilty. Prosecutors would offer you a ""deal"" even for things you were not accused of as long as they got a conviction. If you refused the deal then they would layer-cake trumped up charges with Mandatory minimums.

And no you do not get to be a fire fighter when you get out even if you are trained.

"Lots of misinformation running around here.
The inmate handcrew firefighter program (there are also inmate staffed prison fire departments. This isn't about them) is an actual voluntary program (unlike like most other prison work programs) that is highly sought after. They get better living conditions with better food (and more of it on fires), no cells, less guards, no armed guards, no gun towers, no barbed wire, for some they live in some of the most beautiful places in the state, get more conjugal visits, receive job training in at least two trades including wildland firefighting, get 2 for 1 time off their sentence, and can petition to have their records expunged. They can and do get hired by Cal Fire and the Feds, and now many local government departments.

These media articles pop up with this garbage every major fire, some new liberal reporter rewrites a prior article without doing much research, then people run around all flutter screaming about slavery until the next shiny object comes along and don't actually help the subject of their excitement because they don't want to do the work of crime reduction and prison reform, meanwhile people that actually know the facts and have worked in or with the program have to repeat ourselves over and over again explaining it. WTF? Butt-hurt about inmate firefighters? Fix the reasons they are in prison in the first place.",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"I will say that Washington's program is much better than this. They get paid fairly well fighting fires and can obtain 5k a paycheck on big fires. Outside of fire season, they can do tree planting or fuel reduction and can make good impressions and get hired by DNR or other partners. Once they are out, if they prove themselves on a line, they can join transition fire crews and become line bosses or machinery bosses for the state. I think it has a much better outcome than California's programs. You can check out the Sustainability in Prisons Project for more info and to donate to help support more opportunities for incarcerated people.",POSITIVE,Reddit

"Average cost per year, per inmate, is $42,672, nearly 3x more than poverty levels / minimum wage. Equates to $20.51 per hour. Then they make whatever they make doing this.

ETA: $5.80x2080(full time hours/yr) = an additional $12,064/yr

For a total of $54,736

Yes I know they may not/won‚Äôt work 40hrs a week, this is just to offer perspective that we have people making minimum wage **not able** to have 3 meals a day, without the security of knowing where they will sleep next month. üëçüèª his breath is better spent elsewhere, these guys seem perfectly fine with the opportunity they have.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

I‚Äôm in California. My cousin‚Äòs husband is a firefighter on the front lines. Somebody literally asked him the other day because he is a captain so he knows this kind of stuff. They asked him if an inmate who they have out there helping to fight these fires after their released wants to apply he said because they have helped and trained and stuff this expunges a lot of stuff off their record. Absolutely they can apply and it will show that they were on these fires as an inmate helping they will get hired so whoever is putting it out there that it‚Äôs illegal to hire an ex inmate is absolute false as longas they have proof and have shown that they were trained and an active fire and expunges their record and they can absolutely apply and try and get hired,NEGATIVE,Reddit
Also to mention the private brigade protects only the client's interest. They do what's needed to protect only that mall for example. They're mercenaries.,NEGATIVE,Reddit
"So, when the LAFD were struggling to protect homes and businesses from being incinerated due to extreme demand on the water system exceeding supply, the mega wealthy paying for private fire brigade teams had to play a part right?

Am i getting this right?",NEGATIVE,Reddit
"Con crews great guys and dam fine cooks, great to see them be represented in such a unfortunate time. In addition to calling for reforms for how they are paid a good majority of professional wild firefighters also going through the same struggles. With the forest service the going rate is 15$ hour. And there has been a mass exodus due to terrible wages, no housing, and people who jump out of planes losing healthcare. It is an incredibly gut wrenching seeing California deal with incredible fallout and for the harrowing actions first responders and the residents are dealing with. But this isn‚Äôt solely about California but the west at large. It is our responsibility in living so close to natural beauty to be the stewards of this land and to protect the people and places we love. From all the mismanagement finger pointing that has happened since the beginning of these fires ,there are people like this who are incredibly proud to be apart of their community and to put their lives in danger. To do their job for the community and for each other. So if you find the time look into the forestry technician world of the forest service, the failure of the Tim hart act ,and governments failure to those who fight fires.

They get to go be part of society for a bit instead of being kept in a boring, deprived, and even dangerous environment that they spend every day in when they're inside. They are actually treated like human beings and get to have some camaraderie instead of looking over their shoulder and having to act tough all day. It is dangerous, yes, but it feels good to work and be part of something, they know they are saving peoples' lives and homes, and protecting the environment.

Poor areas will run on massivly reduced coverage - maybe in other services too - while rich areas are perfectly covered. By lower services for the poor, there need to feed their children by minor crimes will rise and create more prison labor available to the market.

I wonder when the first privat prison companys start competing in labor costs. Might murderers be more wage compliant then minor crime people? Private police services could quickly start persecuting for the most productive crimes.

"quote

Anyone can make a mistake. When a person makes a mistake, they should have the opportunity to learn from it, fix it, and move on with their life. In Texas, certain types of first-time, low-level offenders are given this second chance at a fresh start. This helps them to obtain employment without their record being a part of their application. Once you have met all of your obligations under the law, Texas's ""Second Chance Law"" allows you to move on. You can move past a conviction and get on with your life.

"Did you know that private prisons for profit (PPP) are jammed packed with non-violent convicted individuals that all states use for very cheap or free labor? 

The violent offenders are not usually given the chance to work for obvious reasons. Another obvious thing is that these individuals will never complain or have any recourse for their treatment in this capacity because they have a choice to work or not to work.

The culture and systems are designed to extend all prisoner stays and keep that cheap labor going. The prison gets taxpayer money to run and get more with more inmates. Noone will ever fight for humane prisoner treatment because all prisoners are painted with the same shade of Evil. So many inmates' lives are left to being run by gangs within, ignored or bullied by the guards without, and worked hard if they want to see society again.

There was a massive scandal with Kamala Harris when she was AG of California for knowingly keeping inmates incarcerated beyond their release dates as well as fighting to keep inmates locked up when recommended for release, essentially enslaving them, specifically to use them as additional free slave labor for the state, predominantly to fight wildfires.

"You can't get a job as a Firefighter with a felony. They also get paid like $5 a day and they have been through the same training as professional Firefighters.

"You‚Äôre not just fighting fires as a firefighter. That‚Äôs like %4 of the job. The rest of the job is medical. Not only do they need to have their fire carts.

After that then it‚Äôs a rigorous hiring process of background checks, polygraph, psych eval, etc etc. With the hiring pool being of hundreds of applicants who have no previous record it seems to be the choice of‚Ä¶ why take a chance on someone with a record who, when going into the home of someone unresponsive that they may steal or cause further harm. I understand it‚Äôs unfair that their past choices don‚Äôt define who they are today. But when these municipalities are given the choice.

"They're saying what they have to say in case the parole board ever sees the video. They're doing hazard pay level work if they were in a union as a regular firefighter they would be making 70 times more. 

But the state gets a big discount on all this manpower you don't even have to pay them minimum wage. 

And this is California where their relatively progressive. In the south and like Arizona you don't get paid shit. You work if you're in prison it's not an option. In Alabama you are literally a slave. It's in the constitution, the anti-slavery amendment has a carve out for incarcerated people. It's legal slavery. 

So yeah it's pretty bad in California but there are a hell of a lot worse states to get caught being a criminal in.

"The term ""firefighter"" is a very broad descriptor.  What these guys do IS a valid and useful thing, but it is NOT THE SAME as being in FDLA etc.  They are paid less mainly because the system is taking advantage of incarcerated persons as cheap labor, but also because the service they provide is not as valuable as municipal firefighters.  The training is different, the equipment is different.  It is NOT the same.  

Here's an analogy.    A MacBook Pro is a high end powerful ""computer"", a MacBook Air is a high end decent ""computer""  The value of these two things are not the same even though they are both ""computers""

"White sweatshirt girl is a great example of why some crises could be prevented/lessened by a good person who is nearby, but often aren't.

One man looked at this situation, said ""this ride needs weight on the front side to stop from falling over"", and stepped up. White shirt girl sees the ride, and sees the man, and even takes a step towards helping but then STOPS! Only once she sees 2 or 3 other people rush to help right after she stopped herself does she join the effort. And then, of course, another dozen or two people jump in very quickly.

This is the Denial/Delay moment that we all must prepare for at the start of a crisis. Rides, built by engineers and maintained by staff, do not *normally* fail and crash and hurt people. Because this type of scenario is not normal, we often find ourselves receiving evidence that things are not normal but disregard or question it as our first reaction. This woman saw that people needed help but physically stopped herself from providing it until she got the validation that it wasn't her misreading things, or one cooky guy playing hero when it isn't called for.

An example of the evidence being disregarded: On 9/11 it took an average of 6 minutes for interviewed survivors to begin evacuation (many finished an email, or gathered their things, spent time looking out the windows first, properly shut down their computers, etc). A shaking building, debris falling from higher floors, alarm systems blaring...these aren't normal. But we are more likely to believe that some reason we haven't considered that IS totally normal is the cause for this, because this building falling down is so incredibly abnormal that it simply CANT be happening.

Sometimes the thing is actually happening, and gaining validation from peers or an overwhelming amount of undeniable evidence first, a normally helpful tactic, can cause deaths.",POSITIVE,Reddit

As we got off, our cart safety bars didn‚Äôt quite lift the first time and they had to keep attempting to release the bar. Finally it did but it also had busted me square in the face. Blood immediately, ripped my eyelid apart. Had to get two stitches. Not a fun time. We did get refunds of our tickets, and a free pass that summer that my mother ironically still used.",POSITIVE,Reddit
"There is a video from another angle.  In that video one can see it was not the person alone who decided to risk his safety. There were three people, one held the side closer to camera (farther side from this) and two of them went to hold the other closer end.  The three initially are NOT in the view of this camera when they walked together to help so it appears as if one guy came first and then others came.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

"Where I live, was a different carrocel. It has 3 seats and no kids can ride by themselves cuz the safety gear is too big for them. They need to ride with two big adults in order to be safe and still it's not that great. Somehow, a parent felt cheap and didn't ride with the kid, kid by himself on the rise fell off and died. That ride no longer went to that event ever sense. We call it grasshopper cuz it goes around in a circle up and down. It's a cool ride but not ideal for kids even tho it looks like it could be. 

The electric carts are really fun too. There's some for all ages and some smaller ones for kids. It's nuts to think that around 1990 those things could ride at double the speed and the area was much bigger. There's stories of them riding off stage.

A woman and her daughter got on and I started the ride only for it to start slipping backwards as it started to climb up one of the incline. I just had to say fuck it and stopped the ride to get them off. 



The other stuff I saw there was crazy. I ran a ride that spun in circles and the height requirement was not at all accurate. There were a few times I had to stop that one because the kid just barely made the height requirement, and they were riding solo, but I started to see them slip under the bar because they were so small as the ride picked up speed.

"I went to a fair once in London, England. Had the usual rides and my friends and I always loved the tilt a whirl, so we all got on and sat down. Dude comes along and checks the bar is pulled down and locked and he walks away as the ride started to spin

The same dude comes back and spins us around, does the same for other people on the ride. Out of the corner of my eye I see him coming back, walking past an empty spinning chair, and the bar must have got loose as it sprang up and hit him. 

I turn in his direction, he basically gets thrown across the ride, into a chain link fence. The ride stops and people are screaming and we run over to help him, but his body is facing down and his head is facing us. He's shaking like crazy but then the other workers wouldn't let us near him.

I also didn't know how to lock the pin myself but they missed that it wasn't locked when checking it.

Lower center of gravity means shorter ‚Äúmoment arm‚Äù which is engineering term but think of the body as a lever, the longer the lever the easier it is to rotate it. 

Driving the feet is also I think increasing friction. Others in the comments are wrong that you want more feet and more area. You want more normal force so you want all your weight on one foot. One foot would have higher pounds per square inch on the ground. Obviously you can‚Äôt walk on one foot but if you alternate you‚Äôre getting the benefit.",NEGATIVE,Reddit

"It's fascinating how the dynamics of weight distribution play out in tug of war.

10 women vs 8 men

Women *are* genetically smaller than men, meaning less mass, therefore less weight to use as strength, so yeah, if you get more women they‚Äôre going to win.

Women are generally lighter and more flexible, making them good at endurance sports and gymnastics, even martial arts to a degree due to competition karate sparring being about speed and competition karate Kata being about control and accuracy. We should pride women on what they‚Äôre good at, not get them to outnumber some men so they can pretend to be good at something they‚Äôre genetically worse at.
