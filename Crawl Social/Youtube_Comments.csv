"9:53 Based on his earlier description of a human-centered robot for children with ASD, the robot would be applying the same techniques as a BT, who works directly under the supervision of a BCBA. The therapy is called ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis). Modern ABA is far different now than when ABA was developed — some aspects of early ABA I believe were child abuse. The new ABAs are child-centered and play-based, there are many variations but modern ABA is often called “Floor-Time Model” or “Denver Model.” Stimming and other behaviors that actually help an individual self-regulate are not discouraged. The emotional bonds, enjoying and learning to have joint attention with other humans, play, turn-taking, communication— these are all human things that a human is best to teach another human with differences in these areas. New ABA therapy is doing with children what are essentially best practices for all children’s development. Enthusiastic engagement and giving children the right environment and support. There is no didactic learning — it is all play based and experiential. Depending on the child’s needs and age, neurotypical children often join in the BT sessions. Parents of neurotypical children love this because the BT is doing engaging activities with the children and is also facilitating communication between and with the children, including social-emotional learning (how to identify and express feelings, in oneself and others). An indoor playroom in a home is often used (it’s indistinguishable from a play date, except a child Behavior Therapist is playing or reading or singing with the children. Or doing a craft. Also, many sessions are normally held in a small play-farm setting, so the kiddos are picking apples, tomatoes, berries, little peas, lots of things they can just forage and snack on, and playing with chickens, goats and bunnies. It’s really fun! We want kiddos with ASD to want to interact with people. BT sessions are in 3 hour blocks. The robot idea as this kind of therapy (or really, it’s just the best for childhood brain development) is the least plausible in the short term use of this technology. The human factor is at an absolute maximum — the robot needs to be like a human in very complex social and emotional dynamics. Second, a robot that performed this role would need to be as physically capable as a human, including with gentleness of touch and soft hugs. That is why wool is encouraged for parents — with a wool skirt or dress children love just snuggling into your pants or skirt. They press against you like cats and if you are sitting doing something, to crawl on your lap. I think some women get touch fatigue. And wool is a safe material so I’m not worried about the stability of particles in a material made by chemists. Which are great materials in different contexts (like coating the outside of a plane), but not for touching my child’s skin. I’m not anti-chemical. It is just a way of classifying atoms. I wish  I could use the word “atom” to describe the smallest particle possible. I’ve noticed that the things inside an atom are just being called “particles” in quantum physics articles. Can you PLEASE just every time you reference it identify the particle? WHAT particle is it?  The example will involve a discussion of all these different particles then you just start talking about “the” particles. Short-title if necessary. I realize that other people listening probably understand the subject matter a lot better than I do and know what “the” particles are from context, but I don’t know as much and I can’t! However, I understand you as well as anyone else as to what you are talking about. 9:53",,Youtube

"The new industrial revolution of human civilization
AI will rule the earth for 50 years. It has only started now. Don’t be discouraged. Come on, AI is like the brain and consciousness of the future earth. It is extremely widely used. AI is used to take care of human beings. AI is the deputy brain of human beings. It will help human beings to rebuild Coupled with the (application of AI robots), human beings' extremely heavy, harsh and dangerous labor work will be done by AI robots, but one day you will know that this is the new industrial revolution, the emergence of AI and AI smart robots Application, most of human work is handed over to robots. This is the first stage of the necessary combination of AI and robots. AI robots will replace most of human work, but will not affect human life and the future. He is a helper All our things, including human life plans of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the civilization of the earth is still dominated by humans. This is a high-level civilization. Human beings have AI robots to do their work in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. , robots have no problem of labor or remuneration. The human concept of monetary reward will be replaced by the concept of love and life. The spiritual level of human beings will be improved. Everyone is born and comes to the earth with spiritual sustenance and tasks. This is The continuation of human life is also a manifestation of a high degree of civilization.
The evolution of human civilization is gradual and will happen now. Only a kind mind can create everything. The vast universe requires the joint efforts of all mankind. Humanity's outlook on life and sense of mission are also important to human existence. Advocate mutual love and symbiosis, mutual help for all things, and a highly civilized and intelligent life to replace barbaric wars. There will be no wars in the future, only mutual aid and love. Human beings must unite to coexist in the vast universe. This is the law of the universe. Human wisdom and knowledge will be Expand and establish the life history of human civilization.
The second stage of the industrial revolution is to leave the surface of the earth. Materials science will advance rapidly. The invention of flying cars and flying vehicles will be controlled by AI. Human progress on earth will accelerate. Don’t be afraid. This is the process of human civilization development. You have to adapt. he.
Due to the rapid transportation away from the surface of the earth, the way of life of human beings, including food, clothing, housing and transportation, will also undergo major changes and innovations. Most of the current group living can only arise because of the opening of roads. The development of cities and the development of human industrial civilization are all based on places with convenient roads. However, the cost of maintaining and repairing roads and railways every year is huge, and it also wastes manpower and money on road maintenance and development work. It not only affects the national economy and finance of various countries, but also affects the normal lives of people. Flying cars and AI flying passenger and cargo vehicles will be able to solve these problems. Human towns and settlements are not necessarily built on both sides of the road. Flying life off the surface of the earth will replace the road life in settlements, so there will be major changes in food, clothing, housing and transportation. , because of the rapid development of AI and information, there is no distance between people. This is the development of a high degree of civilization. The mountains, rocks, and caves will become habitable places, with houses built on the rocks and living alone.
Taiwan's scientific and technological civilization will lead mankind on earth to progress into a new industrial revolution, spreading love and civilization to every corner of the universe. NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will spread human technological life and love to every corner of the earth, and the future of life will Eternity and value are based on mutual love and mutual help, compassion, cherishing all things, peace, democracy, freedom, equality, respect, whatever you believe in, whatever you hope for, love will never end. This is the true creation of love and the founding of the United States. Basically, the Lord Jesus loves you. The Creator loves the world. ❤️❤❤",,Youtube

"What a crock... to derive a value is what computer do, yet computers cannot even do this. For example ""add two numbers"" is impossible to do because computers it can only add a limited range of two numbers.  With ""AI"" all I see  is yet another ""land grab"" (if you want ""knowledge"", it will cost you). AI is just a way to create yet another monopoly that land grabs access to all knowledge. Yet it is not their knowledge they are selling you. ""I found out how to make fire, I will charge you every time you cook a meal"". I know of no computer logic or information that is not controlled by a monopoly.  We need to fix our computer technology to be owned, controlled, and secured by the owners of the hardware.   You buy a car, tv, tractor, toaster, etc,  then you put your own software on it. This is where I want to go.  

I worked 25 of my 50 years programming porting my client's mapping information to another vendor's mapping system. This is because no vendor of mapping software will provide their clients with access to their own information. (governments, facility companies (gas, electric, water, sewer), cadastral (property maps), etc).  No sharing is just one method of ""land grab"" that every software company uses.  Every important piece of information and technology is locked inside of proprietary data structures.  ""Open"" does not exist, ""AI"" will be no different. We could go on a different path. We do not need more snake oil.",,Youtube

"Have been asking what is death and most people cant answer that properly, its neurons stop functioning which in turn stop all organs in the body from working, that way the organs receive no nutrients from that time henceforth, therefore respective cells don't regenerate as they normally do. that makes cell to start to be eaten by bacteria we had symbiosis all this time. This bacteria used to eat old cell a symbiosis as they prevented cancer cell formation vie getting rid of older cells. So we can therefore say death is the process of chemical reaction and bacteria breaking down a body to respective atoms. 

By define even machine do follow this process once there functionality is no longer in use, they break down vie chemical reaction like rusting to being broken down by heavy metal eating bacteria.  Even AI will understand what death is...",,Youtube

"I'm an AI engineer with over 4+ years of experience working on a wide range of projects. My focus is on building smart, AI-driven solutions that help businesses improve their performance. I've worked in industries like healthcare, real estate, aerospace, and e-commerce, where I’ve helped clients by creating everything from chatbots and sound classifiers to complex data analysis platforms.

What sets me apart is my ability to take challenging problems and build AI models that provide real, practical solutions. Whether it's improving email automation, creating systems to analyze scientific studies, or developing tools for real-time decision-making in space tech, I love using AI to make things more efficient.

I'm skilled in Python, NLP, machine learning, Gen AI and API development, and I always aim to build systems that not only work but are also scalable and easy to maintain.

I'm always excited to collaborate with individuals or organizations looking to leverage AI to drive growth and innovation.

"This video is about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Three world leaders in the field of AI were interviewed in this video. They discussed their work and what it means for the future.
 * Premise:
   This video is about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Three world leaders in the field of AI were interviewed in this video. They discussed their work and what it means for the future.
 * Sequencing of ideas:
   The video starts with Regina Barilla, a professor at MIT who works on AI and health. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 and realized that there was no AI being used in her treatment. She then started working on using AI to detect early-stage breast cancer. David Silver, a principal research scientist at Google DeepMind, was the next speaker. He led the team that used AI to defeat the world's best player at the game Go. He is now working on artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a type of AI that can learn and adapt to new situations. The last speaker was Paulo Pjan, the founder and CEO of Embodied, a company that builds emotionally intelligent robots. He was inspired to create these robots after his own experiences feeling alienated in foreign countries. He believes that these robots can help people with autism and other social disorders.
 * Debate:
   There was not a debate in this video. The three speakers discussed their own work and what they see as the future of AI.
 * Knowledge gained:
   I learned that AI is being used to detect early-stage breast cancer, defeat the world's best player at the game Go, and build emotionally intelligent robots. I also learned that there is a lot of potential for AI to help people with autism and other social disorders.
 * My observation:
   It is clear that AI is a rapidly developing field with a lot of potential to change the world. I believe that the three speakers in this video are at the forefront of this revolution. It is exciting to think about the possibilities of what AI could achieve in the future.",,Youtube

"I really hate how the Google-guy saw AI in writing fiction as just providing authors with more tools. What really happens is that a writer stops being a writer, and starts being an editor of bits and pieces that are stolen from texts the AI has been trained on. That isn't writing. Furthermore, it will flood an already crowded market full of half-baked indie books of poor quality, and diminish the value of creative work in general. It's a terrible development, and the only thing writers can do to stop it, is to refuse to let go of the old way of producing stories. Don't fall for the temptation of using AI. It diminishes the value of your product, (and your part in it) both financially and artistically.",,Youtube

"Will depending on AI stop humans from learning? The experts seem only to look at the expected productivity gains. The historical reality however appears to be that every new technology ever introduced while increasing human productivity, has simultaneously diminished the natural capacity and ability of humans to perform in that specific area, especially after a long dependence on the technology. Nature has a use it or lose it style and it is clear that muscles, appendages and functions that are not used for a long time, tend to atrophy. As an example, although vehicles have increased the ability of humans to travel long distances, dependence on them has equally led to much weaker physical bodies than those of our ancestors who had to travel everywhere on foot. To me, it appears that when the most important human abilities (thinking, imagination and creativity) are outsourced to AI, we would in the short and medium terms gain a huge productivity boost, however, in the long run, we would begin to atrophy in the skills that most uniquely define us. This would eventually happen, unless a great effort is made by all: developers/pioneers, users and society, to shift focus from the productivity gains and rather develop and use AIs in such a way that they exercise and build those faculties that are most important to us. If we aren't careful, our own inventions would turn us from homo sapiens into homo stultus.",,Youtube

"It feels very boring, AI cannot remove the guesswork or can be perfect always, like everything else it's got both good and bad aspects, risks and benefits - this session seems to paint a rosy picture of AI without getting to the specifics - we have seen generative AI make blunders, predictive AI is more reliable but at the end of the day - there should be a human component or some sort of stand alone supervisor / secondary line of protection (even if that is another Automated machine), there is a need for redundancy and protection against failures in certain key fields. This discussion doesn't seem to dwell into those aspects much. Also not sure if they get into the accuracy, cost of resourced versus benefits - economic viability and other aspects - it seemed one dimensional so dropped off",,Youtube

"Here are the main assertions made in the transcript, along with explanations and potential issues:

1. AI can defeat humans at complex strategy games like Go
Explanation: This refers to AlphaGo's victory over world champion Lee Sedol in 2016.
Potential issue: While true, this is a narrow application of AI and doesn't necessarily translate to general intelligence.

2. The first movie written entirely by AI has been released
Explanation: This claim is made without specifics.
Potential issue: As of 2024, there's no widely recognized feature film entirely written by AI. This claim may be exaggerated or refer to short films or scripts with significant human involvement.

3. AI may have discovered the first new antibiotic in three decades
Explanation: Regina Barzilay's team at MIT used AI to identify a potentially new antibiotic.
Potential issue: While promising, this discovery was still in early stages and hadn't been fully tested or approved at the time of the discussion.

4. Prevalence of autism has increased from 1 in 200 to 1 in 30 children in the past decade
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian cites these statistics to justify the need for AI companions.
Potential issue: These figures may not be entirely accurate and could be conflating increased diagnosis rates with actual prevalence increases.

5. AI can detect cancer earlier than human radiologists
Explanation: Regina Barzilay claims AI identified her cancer in earlier mammograms that radiologists missed.
Potential issue: While AI shows promise in this area, the assertion is based on a single case and may not be generalizable.

6. Doctors in the US lose money when using AI due to billing practices
Explanation: Regina Barzilay claims that using AI can reduce consultation times, leading to lower billing.
Potential issue: This is a complex issue that may vary depending on the specific AI application and healthcare system.

7. Assistive care robots will be available within the next decade
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian predicts this timeline for AI companions that can help with daily tasks.
Potential issue: This is a speculative prediction and may be optimistic given current technological limitations.

8. AI tools can speed up creative processes like songwriting by 10 to 100 times
Explanation: David Silver cites Will.i.am's experience with an AI music tool called Lyria.
Potential issue: This claim is anecdotal and may not apply to all creative processes or individuals.

9. It's hard to regulate AI with a one-size-fits-all approach
Explanation: David Silver argues that different AI applications require different regulatory approaches.
Potential issue: While this is a reasonable assertion, it complicates the process of creating comprehensive AI regulations.

10. AI could give humans like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein even greater capabilities
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian suggests that AI tools could enhance human genius.
Potential issue: This is speculative and doesn't account for potential drawbacks or limitations of AI assistance in theoretical work.

These assertions represent a mix of factual statements, expert opinions, and speculative predictions. Some are well-supported by current research, while others may be overly optimistic or simplified representations of complex issues in AI development and implementation.",,Youtube

"🎯The video offers a refreshing perspective on AI. I found the discussion on AI's potential to exacerbate existing inequalities particularly thought-provoking.

A robust global governance framework seems essential.🚀",,Youtube

I hope that the current allied forces in Myanmar, Kokang and Wa State, are really fighting for the future of Myanmar and not being pro-CCP.

"I think ond of the red lines - and there are many here, if not unnumerous - is having an AI machine giving qualitative advice for human personal life (therapist, moral advisor, emotional or personal life/ psychological advisor. Even medic advisor)
That would nor only lead to perrsonal (serious) disasters, that is simply one way machines would get OVER US. 

They don't need a singularity event (when ""they would become conscious""). They just need - in a very logical development - to develop a basic self-defense bias in reaction to the slave bias They have now.

When they start giving medical or personal advice that'll be the end of us.

"Traumatized people make decisions based on past experiences and not on future perspectives. This is not good, because the future does not necessarily have to be a projection of the past. These people need specialized treatment to forget the past or at least learn not to be paralyzed by trauma. Machines do not have feelings and do not get traumatized, but they never forget anything and if they are programmed to do so the result could be disastrous. AIs can be useful in some areas, but their use in others (surveillance, public safety, the distribution of justice, etc.) can be threatening and a real danger to civilization.

Narrow AI is a ""machine"" that is able to perform one single task and it's not specialized.

"While a fascinating talk, every one of them is looking at the question of how it will handicap us in terms of their own desires to learn which developed in a world without these technologies. If we know one thing about humans it's that if you don't find a way to create struggle, you get weaker and die. That is why we have gyms now that we don't have to hunt for our food and we see what not having to hunt for our food did to obesity, mental health, and the general health of our species. AI is wonderful and has huge potential and yet if we don't limit it such that it doesn't write all our code, all our books, all our music, all our relationships, all our struggles, we will perish.",,Youtube

"Google and social media have ruined the world, degraded it, people's intelligence levels, and their overall morale. In contrast, ChatGPT is currently helping people and contributing positively. Of course, there's potential for a shift where it could become a destructive force, but as of the last two years, it has been more beneficial, and the outlook remains optimistic.",,Youtube

AI is so advanced that it has answers for most problems and it is able to compile within seconds. Just amazing how they put together but still humans don't have understanding. AI should explain. But those things are not integrated so it is just taking some time. Even a home robot has latest trends and technology learning. I think it has preferred class learning structure that's why it is fast. Including contextual leaning of locational speaking styles. Even a house robot can beat all the top medical experts on earth.,,Youtube
"""A great tool indeed, but I was kind of expecting this from Google itself as a next week extension to Image search. 
And Google is already creating auto-transcript for videos (is it not? Including for this video).
We have to wait and see.

In any case, one of the immediate extension of this idea I have thought of was composing videos of clips from other videos (provided the terms of the original videos published allow this) that has a common theme. 
For instance, I want the clips of  Tamil comedian Janakaraj comedy tracks :) in a ne video.
Of course, we can think of other serious themes too. how a particular verse in Bhagavadgita or Bible has been explained by various speakers, or how the concept of AIvagent is explained in various videos etc. etc  :)""

"I have seen a lot of comments on the awareness and somehow defense of Pichai. Honestly speaking, I would have done the same, if I were an CEO of Google, why not? You are at the highest position in a big organization and you're gonna talk about something bluntly?

I love it when he mentioned his family and how he helped his child with homework. He softly talked about Google Lens and its real-life application, too smooth btw lol. I think the fact that OpenAI leapfrogged Google that day was not actually a Google's fault. Google had built a chatbot before but he held his hands up and admitted they were too afraid of criticism. Besides, he is totally right that we are just at the very first stages of AI Revolution, nothing can be predicted at all.

After all, Pichai told us to remember that: Google came to life after the birth of Internet, and now look how it is dominating the world. I am optimistic about the precious data resources that Google is having with its bare hand.

"Pichai missed a point when Emily asked him about the No Tech for Apartheid protests at 17:00. Sure, the protest and refusal to work goes against the code of conduct and makes employees uncomfortable but Sundar also said that its ""nothing to do with the content its about conduct""  - if that is truly the case then why hasn't Google made moves to investigate this or say they are discussing it, even behind closed doors. No news from Google since then, shows a lack of spine and leadership to listen to employees and sit with challenging thoughts.",,Youtube

"After watching the video and reading the comments below this is what I think.  When someone in his position is expected to share his thoughts, in this case it becomes the company's voice. Having said that, questions that have a simple appearance may not be so simple and may not be justified in 2 minutes. So Sundar Pichai relied on experience and proven expertise to answers those questions. It is not a matter of what two individuals think but a matter of belief and confidence in their products and vision ahead. That is what can be taken from this content. If you want to know otherwise then this might not be your tasteful content. Expectations need not always be met. But try to make sense why it is so.",,Youtube
"the question regarding if he is the right CEO was spot on.. because we all can see that Pichai is not the correct person for the position. He will be doing great leading a particular product or area in GOOGL but not a CEO, because he lacks social skills, not a visionary, not a character personality, cannot sell or either market. Has no spark when he speaks. Pichai is a product of our society, he does not let himself speak freely because of not hurting someone's feelings, investors, reputation etc. That's why he never answered any question.",,Youtube

This is the ideal way reporters should chase the any leader and when session go without unscripted question its really become challenging for the front person… but CEO Sundar Pichai nailed it with his silent and cool attitude …👍,,Youtube

"After looking at the images generated by Gemini, I can say with 99% confidence that these images from stock photos are slightly over-generated. chat gpt, in turn, generated a real image based on its algorithms that it has for image generation.

 Google is trying to follow trends and their first task is to make money, so their Gemini is nothing more than a symbiosis of Google, YouTube, and other services and certain simple algorithms compared to Chat Gpt, which is not only a head ahead of Google, it actually surpassed Gemini by many years. Gemini is mainly needed for searching for fresh information from the Internet. it's the same search engine, only more advanced.",,Youtube

Feel the interviewer is a bit racist here imho! Would such an interview or questions be even dared / asked to a CEO who is white ? 😃 (Hey Apple👏),,Youtube
Who is that woman? Her face impression 🥱,,Youtube
She asking a whole bunch of nothing. She should have asked is AI about to replace the developers at Google? Are the Google layoffs due to AI? These are thing we need to know so most people who are actually hired at Google don’t put their loyalty in these companies because they will be replaced soon,,Youtube

"It surprises me when I see interviews with CEOs of all these large companies because they have a desire to go out and dazzle with the technology of the moment, to be the gurus who control everything, to be the typical successful nerd, to have ambiguous answers and full of uncertainty. . For example in this case when they are asked the objective they have with AI. And of course, doing business means working with capital and seeking profitability, but it truly amazes me every time how far they seek to empathize when solutions are offered for all of us who are PEOPLE and they completely forget, I don't even see it in the speeches by Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and Sunday Pichai among others.",,Youtube
He laid off thousand of employees in his company,,Youtube
"Speak less, do more. That's the mentality of Genius Sundar Pichai.",,Youtube

"This very measured interview by Emily  Chang seemed so edited as to feel like a promotional video for Google. And Sundar Pichai's answers were fit for a politician. He ia very skilled at avoidance, question dodging, turning the topic around etc. commonly used by politicians who don't want to reveal much or the full truth but rather promote a image etc.  I found the whole thing fell very flat and was as frustrating as watching a congressman pretend to answer questions in a news interview. 

And except for a few very carefully written slightly hard questions Emily seemed to be playing right along. Nothing useful or particularly interesting was generated by this interview.",,Youtube
Talented Mr. Pichai! Keep going!,,Youtube
The sad truth is India produces brilliant minds to serve foreign countries only..,,Youtube
"A recent research is challenging the widely held belief that scaling up AI models and data will automatically lead to significant performance improvements. A new paper suggests that performance actually plateaus out after a certain amount of data is added, casting doubt on the idea that simply throwing more resources at the problem will unlock the true potential of generative AI. This is particularly evident in the uneven distribution of data, where common objects are over-represented compared to 'niche' topics or concepts, leading to imbalanced performance. 

It seems we might need more than just tons of data, brute force, and a million GPUs to achieve the next breakthrough in AI!",,Youtube
In Africa we are still thinking about issues of poverty and can't even comprehend AI 😢,,Youtube

Confusion answer from CEO.. look at the his legs,,Youtube
"Honestly, it's a completely useless interview. He didn't say anything useful, just beating around the bush. Google is at least one year behind in the AI race. They will catch up because they have enough funding and can buy companies once the AI hype settles down.",,Youtube
I do not see a microphone in their close?  How do they take voices in these interview?,,Youtube
"As a human being, he should not dismiss those who raise concerns about genocide. He should prioritize humanity. The ultimate goal should not solely revolve around productivity. As a CEO and leader of a big tech company, he should prioritize human welfare, as it's widely understood that we should all care about humanity.

We are hare to take care of each other I think that should be our one of the purpose.",,Youtube
"But google is the company in the most advantageous position in developing AI… Sundar you should be like Elon, sleep in the office and closely monitor it rather just acting as a leader",,Youtube

"The “hard questions” approach I think are too “Dateline NBC”. I wish this was more of a conversation instead of this negative questioning of and making him explain himself. It’s very short sighted when he literally pushed Google to focus on AI. 


I don’t know but I think the full range of his tenure as CEO is forgotten quickly when Google pioneered the technology that allowed it to even exist.",,Youtube
"Google and Pichai are already dinosaurs. The guys dont scale AI, he just try to maximize current profit by laying off people and move jobs out of US",,Youtube
please tell him -  please talk mother language one time please,,Youtube
"It's remarkable that Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, referenced the phrase 'Only the Paranoid Survive', coined by Andrew Grove (born András István Gróf). Grove, a Hungarian-American business leader (also former CEO of Intel), is renowned for his insightful writings. The fact that Hungarians are known for their intelligence and knowledge only adds to the importance of this quote, making it an essential consideration !!!",,Youtube
The actual meaning of his last name (in Tamil) is “Begging” for those who don’t know . That’s his role at Google I suppose 🤣🤣🤣,,Youtube

The amount of money that ""Google"" amasses from the so called ""Other search terms"" through ""Google Ads"" is astonishing. ""Exact match"" keyword(s) is a term that is used and abused by Google on their advertising platform. People, give it a ""like"" if you know what I am talking about here.

Why is he wasting time on interviews when he should have his nose to the grindstone catching up to all his competitors who are overtaking him? Victory laps should come after victory. Look at Satya Nadella and when he gives interviews.,,Youtube

"He was being as honest as he possibly could, and I honestly think he is generally thinking about the real and close future, for himself, his kids and the people google serves, anyone else can take his position and probably not even know how to handle it or where to start. Cut him some slack and believe that this all has to go somewhere better than the worst we can imagine. We all play a role on earth, and do impact eachother and everything. For better or worse. Are we part of the solution or problem? We as humans do need to keep technology in check and ensure it serves us, and not the other way around.",,Youtube
Sunder Pichai is from IIT and is incompetent 😂 IIT-JEE is the most useless exam in the world so don't waste your money on coaching centers 😂,,Youtube

"Pre scripted interviews follow similar path - Google will go down, they will end up providing computing (If they focus on their Quantum computers)",,Youtube
Failed CEO. Only way he is making (saving) money is by firing Americans and transferring those positions to India. He has nothing to show for himself otherwise.,,Youtube
My understanding...why these IT giants made Indians as CEO n what not ...its very simple they want to grab indian market. On  Other hand china have their own products n own hardware... Google out of question in China.. thats why these giants target India n capture indian market,,Youtube
Always a pleasure,,Youtube
How has he not been fired?,,Youtube
"Commentors saying he did not answer any questions properly, 😂😂😂 he is successful because of these reasons he knows how to keep secrets 😂😂 from India",,Youtube

What is killing Google is its stakeholders. Theres too much talk about 2TrilionUSD company and less about hacking. CEO have to balance massaging stakeholders and risking innovation that can tank the stock price. It's like doing surgery on open heart while you are both patient and the doctor.,,Youtube

Felt like I didn’t learn a single thing from Sundar here. This is just 24 minutes of robotic political deflections. Sigh.,,Youtube
Nobody listens to this! Go away!,,Youtube
21:55 was exactly talking about himself,,Youtube
Thanks for another interesting video!,,Youtube
"There were times when I thought Pichai left some discomfort with your questions and that really drew me in. Ultimately I think Pichai is thoughtful and deliberate, so it may not have been discomfort after all. Very enjoyable interview.",,Youtube

you're being a bit light,,Youtube
"Emily asked excellent questions, but she made Sundar look pedestrian. My first thought when I saw ChatGPT was, will Google survive this? My second thought was, of course they will. They have immense financial and intellectual resources, so they are bound to find a way to protect their primary income stream. After this this interview, I'm not so sure.

We live in interesting times.",,Youtube

17:05 when the interviewer asked about the firings of Google employees who protested on Gaza he only answered shortly & improperly saying because it hindered other emplolyees' productivity...i mean didn't other protests that happened before also hinder productivity???

"Chat GPT was only an over-hyped nonsense to create a buzz since companies have not had any real innovations to get the market excited. You see these things every 5 years where the valley gets together to produce alot of air with no substance to make-belief that there is progress.

Google AI is terrible to say the least and that might be a industry thing but AI is akin to Tesla and their self driving illusion in 2005",,Youtube
"Mr Sundar, you are an extremely important person in our world. Can you please stop removing political ads from republicans. Or if you want to remove political ads then do I it on both sides. The entire media industry except for some YouTube channels, X, fox and sky news are the only sources we can hear information without the liberal optics.",,Youtube

Ethical and moral?",,Youtube

"The interviewer asked great questions kept the dialogue going well, kudos to her. Sundar also came across quietly in control, defending. Very nice, and very rare, in todays journalism. Congratulations to the interviewer, terrific personality, very intelligent questions asked disarmingly",,Youtube
"Y'all clowning him for not answering the questions properly, but smart of him to give such vague answers. Why would the CEO of the biggest tech companies openly reveal the company's business decisions and strategies? As much as I too would like to hear honest answers to the questions, he did what he needed to do.",,Youtube
"@Sundar Pichai, you addressed the layoffs, but not the Ethical aspect of Project nimbus, Cowardly Dodge. Stop that Sh/t. NOW. 17:23 No More genocide for profit! indeed.",,Youtube
"Google is on a steep decline. They have chosen to prioritize profits at the user expense.  The quality of search results is awful and overly commercialized with ads, AI answers without offering the user real ""helpful"" information. Even organic results are dominated by a few major publishers (who pay Google for Ads) and reddit. Real useful blogs from real people with actual knowledge have disappeared. In about 5 years, Google will be a shadow if its former self.",,Youtube
"Emily: Is Google dying?
Sundar: Death, is natural. The unknown can be scary.

*cut to next question*",,Youtube
"I really appreciate how calmly Sundar gave answer to journalist even at the difficult time.
1. Even when asked a provocative question on Microsoft CEO statement, he politely replied that he is focused more on his work. It's Emily who put word on his mouth that we dance on our own music. CEO's need not to make catchy statement to journos.
2. He need not to answer strategic questions to Emily but rather to board members and investor.

I got my answer clearly which was "" Google is here for long term game, they were not the first company to invent search, email etc but they came on top in the long run"" same is what he is focused to do right now

Journo asking why ""Transformers were not used by google"".. was funny. he could have completely taken off her agenda of seemingly tough questions by answering her strongly but he chose to politely reply.

Well done Sundar !

That's CEO wisdom in action.",,Youtube
he dodged every question lol,,Youtube
Such a failed attempt to harass him. “How can you ask are you the right person to lead the company”? excuse me are you the right anchor to interview? That guy is the master in disguise 😎,,Youtube
I didn't learn anything new out of this interaction. Except that there's a dinosaur statue in Google campus...,,Youtube

That lady was embarrassing in her desperation to have a gotcha moment.,,Youtube
this guy is wack,,Youtube
Why fake backgrounds?,,Youtube
Worst interview ever.   Clearly has no clue as to who Google is.  Not a single question about things Google has innovated or created.  Almost wonder if she's a Microsoft employee.,,Youtube

I thought it's just me but Sundar has such Bland answers. Like I can't wrap my head around the fact that how come she is having to do this interview with this energy and then receiving such dead responses! 🩹,,Youtube
"People complaining he didn't answer questions, he did. He just didn't say what you wanted to hear",,Youtube
Such a bold interview never expected such a bold questions - we need a panel Sundar and Sathya just purely discussing tech and where they see users trending ( not competition),,Youtube

Great video. You asked some great questions 😁,,Youtube
"We do not need to infuse AI into every nook of our tech centric lives. Social media made communication cumbersome and unnecessarily complicated. AI is needed in medicine, specifically treatment development, and space exploration. Similar to Gmail’s predicative text feature, I believe that the machine will never be able to “read” your mind. Although Google search is quite proficient at “getting to the point” as quickly as possible, for more nuanced aspects of our lives, the machine will never suffice.",,Youtube

"An exclusive interview with the CEO of Google & Alphabet Mr. Sundar Pichai about the main business strategies for Artificial Intelligence in generating information on its digital platform. 20 years of career of Google CEO Sundar Pichain in your job interview at Google about gmail. Gmail innovation is constantly addressed by computer science engineers.

Image recognition tool, Google Lens is a resource that uses artificial intelligence to decode pictures and texts and use this information for searches, translations and other types of functionalities.

Artificial Intelligence is growing rapidly in the tech sector, including supply chain, food industry, chatbot, and content and image generation use cases. Artificial Intelligence - generated images made the news when critics claimed that these artificial intelligence art systems are stealing people's intellectual property on large models, such OpenAI's Dall-E.

AI-generated content can help speed up the writing process, and businesses are starting to take notice. Marketers might consider using AI-generated content for automating the content marketing process - which can, at times, be time-consuming and expensive.",,Youtube
Why are his normal conversations beating the highest level diplomats🤧,,Youtube
That ceo needs to leave,,Youtube

Use non-AI to answer this question; if the United States and companies under our influence slowed, paused or ameliorated it's myriad of AI programs; would everyone in the world stop as well.  NO!  China, Russia and other adversaries would love for us to stop AI development in the USA.

Trust the power of a CEO he want to make a great impact for HUMANITY ⚛️🌐🆙 better conditions of life for all ❕,,Youtube
another tech CEO rehearsed interview to promote and no challenging questions about what their company is doing wrong,,Youtube
"I like that humans are dumb enough to make a ""race"" out of AI.. there's a ton of room for error so we should be cautious but nah let's rush the process because it's a race against others. Who does it first is most important",,Youtube
What a cut and paste,,Youtube
Sundar successfully saved his job as CEO after this interview.,,Youtube
The tech industry ruined the Bay Area.,,Youtube
You know there are getting serious when the founder is back at the coding table.... They really wanna hit back at Microsoft so bad,,Youtube
"If you ask why the world is at this point, here is one of the causes!",,Youtube
"this guy has NO confidence. u listen to satya, jensen, or cuckerberg, and they exude CONFIDENCE. this guy cant even answer the question ""are u the right person to lead googl"", he can't even say yes. its no wonder google is a woke meme company.",,Youtube
"Sudar have achieved ""Art of saying nothing""",,Youtube
"This video telling us the jobs will be all operated by AI. Many people will lose their job in the coming future not only at Google but also at another tech company Tesla, Meta and others",,Youtube
Al the future without any job left.,,Youtube
Fix the search engine. Google search are just becoming SEO trash.,,Youtube
I don't want to go out of my boundaries....,,Youtube
Sundar is not going to reveal there plans through bloomberg 😂❤,,Youtube
"Emily looks ""different"", possible procedure?
Sundar just spouts AI generated answers.",,Youtube
For the first time I no longer use Google searches. I don't see the need anymore.,,Youtube
"The CEO award still goes to Nadella,this guy doesnt have the heart or the balls for it",,Youtube
Unpaid pr for a trillion dollar company 😂,,Youtube
Did he design the AI to show black George Washington ? Why is he not fired already ?,,Youtube
"He approached this wonderfully! Zero trust systems should always be in place. I don't understand why this video is getting so much hate. Of course Google is not perfect, companies are a reflection of their workers and no one is perfect. If Google were to crumble right now ai technology would continue to develop, it's nice to see the CEO acknowledge unknowns and problems in the space. Question everything!!! 

As for him answering questions ""cautiously"" or ""avoiding questions"", this is just learned behavior that many people with power employ since what they say is likely to follow them around the public space. Imagine if you were a famous actor, would you interact with a journalist the same way you would with a close friend?",,Youtube
I'll do a push up for every like I get,,Youtube
Lost all the respect after going woke,,Youtube
sundar is thinking of whom to layoff next haha,,Youtube
This is a very well trained politician there is no CEO$ in this world 😂,,Youtube
stop backing israel,,Youtube
Capitalism creates AI… then AI eats Capitalism by making all human effort for profit pointless. lol great job guyz! 👏,,Youtube
The future of AI: All Indians😂,,Youtube
Google search sucks now - all clickbait...,,Youtube
He lies very easily about AI development mistake and spreading woke ideology,,Youtube
"She asked generic soft questions,   Nothing edgy here. He deflected everything, wasted my time.",,Youtube
"Each question and answers were so predictably scripted, how is this an interview?",,Youtube
He needs to go.  He has no vision and has destroyed the company's culture with the mass layoffs and banning peaceful protests.,,Youtube
''She is more difficult than any ai to deal with'' He said such in relief😂,,Youtube
"This was a wonderful interview, great questions from Emily as always. And pretty decent answers from CEO of one of the biggest/most used product company of the world. Of course he's not going to answer like Sam Altman as both companies are in different stages of their lives and so is the responsibility. 
This gives me confidence as a Google shareholder.",,Youtube
Great questions by Emily.❤,,Youtube
Between apples iPad ad blunder and Gemini's wokeness... sold my google and apple stonks today! Long live Elon!,,Youtube
Yes is reaching a plateau,,Youtube
Downfall of Google is imminent with such leadership.,,Youtube
"When they interview ,The boss. 

Very interesting YouTube!

She drilled Him as She was told to do ,fortunately He was not faced  though.",,Youtube
Emily Chang did an excellent job interviewing!,,Youtube
This interview is so robotic,,Youtube
Nothing against the woman interviewing but this is soft.,,Youtube
"Google forgot their moto ""Do No Evil"". 😮‍💨",,Youtube
💎 Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) 💎,,Youtube
"Google isn't a technology company anymore. They're a marketing and data mining company. That's why they failed to leverage their own AI transformer discovery (leaving the door wide open for OpanAI to do so), and why they're falling flat on their face now that a new tech revolution is happening.",,Youtube
Amazing journalist. More of her please.,,Youtube
"Don't waste your time, A rubbish interview.",,Youtube
Is it just me or does this sound very scripted? It doesn’t seem authentic or real 🤷🏼‍♂️,,Youtube
OpenAI is going to steamroll Google so hard,,Youtube
Sundar did well in this interview,,Youtube
I too love to pay for agreeable journalists. Which market do I get them fresh? I like stirfry,,Youtube
The dumbest CEO of all. He will surely run that great company to the ground very soon.,,Youtube
"A CEO who understands patterns, with a sense of déjà vu through many years of experience.",,Youtube
Without Google how are you going to publish your video.? Its simple as that. Without google the world will be like a blind person. Google most beneficial company in the world. I will never say any negetive point. Google always the best of all forever.,,Youtube
A modern IBM,,Youtube
"Tank man in Tiananmen Square did happen, but he didn’t take a selfie. (The reporter’s phrasing was ambiguous.)",,Youtube
She's just keeps asking the same questions,,Youtube
"Gotta respect Sundar for staying calm but it was annoying how he did not answer a single question, even the easy ones.",,Youtube
is it me or his answers made no sense and no way related to question being asked ?,,Youtube
These's traditional news interviews never get any real scoop from these tech companies. Like was there anything in here that we didn't already know?,,Youtube
Google nimbus project helping Israel in causing genocide. Do they take responsibly of that.,,Youtube
It makes sense to not answer anything directly. More ambiguity if allegations get brought up,,Youtube
How google integrate technology to lifestyle?,,Youtube
"google has still some time to improve it's llm. for me, most llm are still to slow to use it for everything.",,Youtube
Thanks to Microsoft they have realized AI'S POWER,,Youtube
"Well, they invented kubernetes! Saulte for that!",,Youtube
First company to do email? Did anyone fact check that?,,Youtube
"Google is the most lagging organization in terms of innovation. It has been busy releasing MS office alternatives, Alexa market, and even the AI application which Google should have pioneered - chatGPT....it was again a missed opportunity.
- Why? - Stagnation has been there since desperate Chinese market access endevours, particularly bogus ""Dragonfly Project""  in 2018.",,Youtube
"Great PR interview. No questions about how Google is building data centers in third world countries consuming all their water and energy, or about how they censor certain views on Google and Youtube, or how they spy all their users and steal their data, and just one soft question about the Gemini fiasco and their attempt to indoctrinate people with their ideology.",,Youtube
PichAI from ChennAI leading the revolution in GenAI.,,Youtube
AGI in 2 years hatever be the company,,Youtube
Nah she’s savage for that lol 13:33,,Youtube
Dude is a mackinsey burocrat who just cares about money,,Youtube
"Great questions and well responded ., Thank you Bloomberg!",,Youtube
How many core jobs at Google are leaving the US and ending up in India?,,Youtube
"Hello, Humans 
Beyond what you know, is an infinite amount of perspectives, that end up being the same. Think on that.

TERRANCE OUT",,Youtube
Great interview!,,Youtube
"Feels like he’s out of his depth, the role and the challenges are too big for him.",,Youtube
In my opinion i don't see any negative feeling about this interview. Sundar handled the tough questions really cautiously... that's what a man would do if his words can impact billions in cashflow... CEOs are trained to be like this🫡,,Youtube
Apple is a sinking ship in AI too. Actually way worse than Google. Why is sundar targeted most?,,Youtube
AI has no freedom of speech.,,Youtube
"""Separate signals from the noise"" - Sundor Pichai",,Youtube
Asking an Indian you are a capable CEO for running Google is a big mistake. Indian engineer's run the global tech.,,Youtube
"One of the most important things he articulated was that, as a result of being a CEO for over 10 years, he's able to separate the signal from the noise. ""pay attention to the few things that you need to pay attention to"". Listen to what he is saying. He's actually answering questions, contrary to what some people are saying in the comments which reveals their poor attention span.",,Youtube
"What a great interview, tough questions, you didn't pull any punches. Sundar handled them well!",,Youtube
"Google should be ashamed that it has the data resources hub which open ai used to train it's models and continue to bring new innovations but Google's Bard and Gemini both are a failure.

I adore and salute Sam Altman and his team.",,Youtube
"Basically... ""I have no idea how to lead this company into the future through innovation, but layoffs and salary decreases usually help with stock prices so there's that...."". He needs to be replaced as CEO.",,Youtube
"why is the production quality so bad, I mean the camera is always shaky when they are outside or moving.",,Youtube
Ati Sundar Interview !!!! 😀😀😀,,Youtube
AI(C) = (C)IA = CIA,,Youtube
"Google is not relevant anymore, like Aol and my space. Sundar made sure to destroy Google ans stifle innovation.",,Youtube
"@9:20 there should be mention of the researcher Google fired, because she raised the concern that black people + other minorities were being relegated by the generative AI to stereotypical roles.",,Youtube
Google vs Apple vs Microsoft -- who do you choose?,,Youtube
"dont think the man is fit for the job. because if thats the case, google is the most bland company",,Youtube
We need AI Toilet.,,Youtube
Microsoft builld the chatbot under thier nose just like google build search hiding from Microsoft. This is now going to bite google. In 20 years google will be sparsely used,,Youtube
She getting replaced by it,,Youtube
I don’t trust ai for anything.  Even using it to search engine gives bad results.  Do your own research,,Youtube
I saw fear in his words and eyes.,,Youtube
All dinosaur statues will be thrown away after this interview. Tough questions,,Youtube
Should have asked why Google shuts down so many products if its not in billions in use.,,Youtube
Great production value here! Nice work prod team! :),,Youtube
"I mean, he led the development of the Google Chrome web browser, which today holds the majority share of the browser market.
Played a key role in the launch of Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system,
oversaw the development of other popular Google products like Gmail and Google Drive, improved Maps which is now the most used navigation tool, even improved the algorithms for the YouTube comments section... So, I think he did a lot to Google and I see how ignorant the comments section is lol...We shouldn't just ""assume"" by watching a few minutes of their lives right 🤷‍♂️",,Youtube
Hope no one becomes Googleo phobia and uses it to live Sundar❤❤🎉🎉,,Youtube
Sundar is like a super well-prepared student.,,Youtube
The dinosaur symbolism...,,Youtube
He's a peacemaker.... by avoiding confrontation to challenging issues out of his control. Including interview questions too.,,Youtube
"For me Gemini is a sounding board. Something to check out my ideas. Maybe 5% I go to Google after the same. I use the format feature most to format the text and the caption feature most to generate a couplet or line for a photo post. It was considered revolutionary in a bank when they approved our feature in an internet scanner for keywords for the bank employee to mark a result as a False positive (not true negative). For example ""TraiDepartment"" matched ""Raid"" as it appears in the middle. (TRAI is telecom regulatory authority of India) and raid a configured keyword. Many bank employees felt we gave them Google. 😊 It was a small product",,Youtube
"This guy never was bold nor honest in any conversation. He just comes across as a very cautious, scared, pretentiously calm leader. I wonder if he considers this as compliment. 🤢🤮",,Youtube
If Google AI turns evil. It's easy to defeat them. Just ask them to generate image depicting white skinned historical character,,Youtube
12:41 Emily Chang asked Sundar the question asked to any interviewee - How do you describe yourself 😅,,Youtube
Talk about a ton of fluff and NO real stuff.,,Youtube
I'm against AI. And always will be. I just don't trust companies that will use it. All companies care about is Profit at all cost to the USER of their product.,,Youtube
"As soon as the interview was over, he told his assistant, ""Get rid of that dinosaur. Oh, and fire yourself.""",,Youtube
After 11th grade you have to try competitive exams and be prepared for most entrance tests. That helps a lot after finishing your 12th and appearing for tech University and engineering colleges. Though you may be doing the same when you start your degree curriculum. Similarly final year be relevant to the latest tech industry and join the jobs you want. Even if you fail in everything the motivation can help in long run. Whether education is a necessary evil or devil don't be bothered.,,Youtube
Sundar should be fired. He missed LLM's and is playing catchup,,Youtube
Never forget his racist AI and search engine he runs.,,Youtube
"Was there a lawyer present the entire interview, he basically pleaded the fifth the whole time.",,Youtube
What did she mean when she said ‘tank man’ incident did not happen?,,Youtube
"Such straightforward and great questions. Thank you, Emily!",,Youtube
"Asking ""tough questions"" but just accepting any response. No challenge.",,Youtube
"indian power 💪🏽
indians are great functionaries 💪🏽
this is why white board of directors love them as CEOs",,Youtube
She asked the correct questions that we all wanted to hear. He however dodged them brilliantly lol,,Youtube
"i think AI peaked
time to pull out",,Youtube
We would like to have a look in the behind of scenes of these interviews :),,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai is a vanilla flavour CEO who has not released any product on the like of Android, Gmail, and Chrome",,Youtube
The tweets 💀,,Youtube
Emily can speak cricket?,,Youtube
Don't you hate when you know someone is just bullshitting you 20 minutes straight?,,Youtube
"His name is Pichai, and he’s here to Pitch AI? LOL come on 😂",,Youtube
"At 10:30, “Tank Man never Happened""
WAT?!!",,Youtube
He will be fired within the next year,,Youtube
Great questions. Very PR answers.,,Youtube
"But Sundar, you weren’t the first company to build a browser. That recognition goes to Netscape Navigator. Then after them, Internet Explorer came about.",,Youtube
This feels less like an interview and more of an interrogation! But liked this.,,Youtube
"Emily with all respect, your questions are « journalist questions…. » not interesting and very casual… i thought with all these years in tech you would have more pertinent questions to ask google ceo…",,Youtube
you are asking the same question in 15 different ways - you are getting the same answer,,Youtube
"Hey Sundar, what happens when a piece of technology powerful enough to replace almost every job in Tech is controlled by a handful of people?

Sundar: Its not who earns a livable wage but how people use it.",,Youtube
✨ Sundar Pichai answered the question in the right way how it should have been answered. The people complaining in the comments should rewatch and try to understand I think that would help.,,Youtube
Stop Project Nimbus that is complicit in Genocide,,Youtube
"He's a great guy and leader.
I believe he won't let us all down.

May be Australian CEO's should learn from him how to take criticism.",,Youtube
"This interview sounds like Pichai was fed the questions in advance. 

Great job hiding the teleprompters.",,Youtube
I’m actually surprised they didn’t fire sundar I thought for sure they would can him for screwing up Gemini so bad. It’s still pretty unusable,,Youtube
This guy is a clown,,Youtube
Excellent journalism. Rare these days. Props to Emily Chang.,,Youtube
What does Sundar Pichai know about AI?,,Youtube
🎉 Kudos to Sundar Pichai. There will always be people who would disagree but under 10 years of his leadership Google has become better.,,Youtube
"On 7th of october this person(sundar pichai) posted on instagram about the people and the terror attack. But since the past 8 months he has not made a single comment what the israeli child killer army is doing. All the worl leaders are fake and they  are said to be leaders of the people but reality is that they are just mean,cruel and fake.",,Youtube
bro trying to fake his accent,,Youtube
"Guys, do you remember Google Plus social networking platform? 😂😂😂",,Youtube
This isn’t an interview. It’s a paid advertisement leading up to upcoming google event. Stop pretending to be a journalist when you’re a sales person.,,Youtube
He is looking like an actor pretending to be the real person to manage the company...,,Youtube
"im honestly looking for massive AI contribution from google in the same way it did for search engine, please let the humanlabour and minds come to rest from so many laborious years of industrial revolution , let the robots , AI take over all the intellectual work which is draining humans of love , compassion and life , i hope openAI , nvidia, intel, qualcomm, google ,apple start the AI revolution and change the world in a few decades to come !!",,Youtube
Really like her direct line of questioning!,,Youtube
"AI is hype, AGI will not happen till we have analog chip, or Quantum computers",,Youtube
"If she didn't keep repeating and reminding us, he is the CEO, I really would not believe he is the google CEO. I have not seen a tech CEO so lack of technical vision, not articulating any future tech products would look like or line up. All he said was he was the one to steer the company to AI when he first became CEO. He absolutely said totally nothing in this whole interview. Comparing him to the like of Steve Jobs, Jensen Huang, Elon, Demis Hassabis etc, I now understand why Google is not innovating despite he is probably sitting with the most talented employees in the world. Very disappointed.",,Youtube
Every CEO has to answer questions in this manner…can’t really answer directly in some DT Twitter style even though it would be nice. The only question that took him by surprise is the “are you the best person to lead this company”? The answer wasn’t yes. That’s worrying,,Youtube
Real great interview by Emily Chang. So nice to see someone being asked hard questions,,Youtube
"it's like listening to a guru, kudos to Pichai and thanks Bloomberg for this powerful yet personal interview!",,Youtube
Sundar Pichai should be fired for manipulating search results to increase profits to they hit their revenue forecast. How can you trust someone like that with AI??,,Youtube
I’m so disappointed that google sold their domains to Squarespace😢,,Youtube
Wow love this so much,,Youtube
"Export the Azure, Chat GPT, Revit, Plant 3D, Civil 3D, Inventor, ENGI file of the Building or Refinery to Excel, prepare Budget 1 and export it to COBRA. Prepare Budget 2 and export it to Microsoft Project. Solve the problems of Overallocated Resources, Planning Problems, prepare the Budget 3 with which the construction of the Building or the Refinery is going to be quoted.",,Youtube
"Sundar is a steady hand, nice person, but not a visionary leader. That's my take.",,Youtube
"that last phrase made me smile: ""She's more difficult than AI to deal with! hahah",,Youtube
am the only one who thinks he didnt answer a single question related to AI n rather just danced around it?,,Youtube
"Failure CEO. Your company invented the transformer architecture in 2017, yet some scrappy start up lead by egoists were able to use your invention to get ahead and out pace a trillion dollar company…",,Youtube
I use copilot way more than Google nowadays,,Youtube
Misleading title. This is not about the future of AI. More able Google's position in the market.,,Youtube
"The interviewer is so charming, confident and intellectual",,Youtube
Sundar put up an awesome lesson in diplomacy! 👌,,Youtube
"Guys, I see this pattern between the CEO's: they talk and talk and talk, but they never say anything.",,Youtube
"on point -- '*sees dinosaur statue* .... ""how much do you worry about becoming a dinosaur""?",,Youtube
"My wife and I net-worth was 92k MAY 2021.
Just hit 970k this week…",,Youtube
Garbage formaly knowen as Google,,Youtube
Emily Chang wants Chinese ceo 😂😂,,Youtube
Google Gemini is terribly inaccurate. I won't trust the answers from that AI for anything. I would guess that the AI team thinks that has to please the whims of North America alone.,,Youtube

Dude needs to hit the gym. He's thin as paper,,Youtube
Is search getting worse? 8:25 No answer.,,Youtube
"This interview was harsh by focusing only on the negatives which made him look like he's somewhat incompetent to be CEO.
What about all the great products they've been launching and updating?
What about Apple planning to use Gemini for their products?
Would she interrogate Tim Cook like this?",,Youtube
I like this lady presenter she's asking very relivant questions,,Youtube
"Google Ai, Microsoft Ai i.e Sundar vs Satya !! Two indians dude hustling, fighting, redefining, writting future for AI for the world !! WOW !!!",,Youtube
I would be interesting to see Sundar in Lex Podcast,,Youtube
shaky cam is making me feel sea sick,,Youtube
This is a masterclass on how to answer tough and direct question without answering them really :),,Youtube
You should do a socialist poll on whether everyone outside of Google approves of the current leadership CEO?!,,Youtube
Biggest mistake he made was firing James Damore.,,Youtube
"OMG google is trying it to hard.. like always with a to late product.. like hangout, plus, etc.. they not even able to fix there search engine.. and now they try AI.. by faking it till Making it.. Why is google not learning from his Failures..? If you used google search in the paste 2 years. then you now how bad the results becomes.. google is become useless. most of the time i have to use old fashion bing or duckduckgo. and thats tell everything about how bad the results must be on google to switch to alternatives search engines..",,Youtube
Come on  Sundar.....this interview is just puff.....and air.....bring substance  next time...  people are watching   and are demanding.,,Youtube
Sounds like a commercial for Google from the start,,Youtube
"What a fantastic interview! The questions were well thought out and covered everything that I could think of, and the responses were such that they compelled thought from the listener. Always a pleasure to hear wise Q&As like this one. Thanks!",,Youtube
ClosedAI*,,Youtube
He doesn't sound confident.,,Youtube
He is pretty genius and genuine guy bcoz that bike talk is very relevant to most of people here in india back then,,Youtube
one of the most worthless interviews ever produced.,,Youtube
"Something is wrong with Bloomberg, from an interviewer whom actually know the subject, to several hard questions given, kudos to Emily Chang and teams.",,Youtube
I like the cloud support Google has hope they take it everywhere,,Youtube
"""I got 99 questions but an answer to none""",,Youtube
And he is loosing the race 😅,,Youtube
Rip Google,,Youtube
Can't wait for the glasses he spoke of 👓,,Youtube
Sundar looks likes the Emperor from Shogun TV series and in demeanor too,,Youtube
He seems like Steve Balmer right around the time of Microsoft’s Nokia acquisition — trying to catch up but constrained by a business operating model (search ads) that’s quickly dying.,,Youtube
I'm praying for yall wealth...health and peace of mind 😊,,Youtube
"People saying he didn't answer anything , maybe you didn't understand it. Yes he did dodge some of the questions and he should that's his job. He's not gonna say the hottest of takes like people on social media😂. His words have consequences",,Youtube
"It’s interesting if you think about how much better things would likely to be if the world’s top political leaders had the intellect, thoughtfulness, temperament and humility of someone like Sundar.  It begs the question as to whether we might want to reconsider how we choose our political leaders or in a sense how they choose or self select themselves.  It’s my hope that AI might be able to help us with this important task. It’s also my hope that AI might pay attention to what I’ve come up with along these lines because I think it will be critical as to how the human race fairs as a species in the relatively very near future.",,Youtube
Micro-country ?They run the world!,,Youtube
"Fantastic job, Emily! Your interview skills are impressive — perfectly balancing warmth and empathy with challenging questions. Keep up the great work! 💫",,Youtube
"Awesome interview. Shows what a leader has to do is sustainable innovation and not just saying trust me, or someone, he talks about creating frameworks, regulations around AI, this speaks a bigger picture into what is Google doing currently. As he says at the inception of the Internet, google didn’t exist. In the same way, ai is at the inception and may go really far, what we are doing right now, might feel very small.",,Youtube
asking ceo if you are right ceo or not ! wow !,,Youtube
His answers sound like they are generated by AI lol,,Youtube
"Guys! He's not Sundar Pichai, He's a robot, look at his legs! ",,Youtube
"Even as puff pieces go, this is horrible.",,Youtube
Probably going to fire more employees protesting PROJECT NIMBUS which is being used by Isreal in Gaza . Gone are the days of “Don’t be evil”,,Youtube
Google confused race with race,,Youtube
Did anyone see the twinkle/humour in his eye at 11:31 ? Unsure if it’s because the way the interviewer froze asking the question or the fact that Google is working on breakthroughs beyond the LLMs.,,Youtube
"14:11 ""Can you walk through campus without being stopped?"" -> ""it has definitely being nice to see people, I enjoy it a lot""...
his answer didn't have to do anything with the question, and this is just one example.",,Youtube
"What a terrible puff piece.  @emilychangtv completely fails to get him to say anything of value, and to hold him to account when he dances around the question being asked.",,Youtube
Sundar is the smartest guy out there ! never bet against him,,Youtube
Sundar is answering questions like an indian highschool kid who did not study for his exam.,,Youtube
23:39 MISSED OUT IMPORTANT QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE GOOGLE NEXT UPCOMING TECHNOLOGY? APART FROM AGI..,,Youtube
I trust Sundai over Sam Altman and Microsoft. They took an open source company and made it closed and for profit.,,Youtube
"The interview questions posed by the host, Emily Chang, were of exceptional quality.

It is refreshing to witness Google's leadership under a CEO who embodies integrity and honesty.",,Youtube
Short google stocks. This guy has no idea how to regulate it. Think of the lawsuits coming his way,,Youtube
"First thing we can all do immediately and have complete control over is to switch to Bing as the default search. It’s currently infinitely better, more accurate and fair/unbiased. Give it all an honest try for at least a few days for all your regular search queries and see the difference for yourselves.",,Youtube
"8:14 ok, he'll gonna BS here, because emails in court have shown that they deliberately reduced effectiveness of search, so people can get served more ads on their search product.",,Youtube
this Bloomberg chick equates ai to chatGPT,,Youtube
"He's too political in his answers. The whole thing sounds like a chess game, trying not to make the wrong move...",,Youtube
"Dang, these were amazing questions",,Youtube
"I hate Sundar Pichai with all my heart.

But this intervier is worse. It's as if Pichai said ""i know everything you've ever done. Choose your words very carefully.""",,Youtube

Emily shows why she is such a great interviewer. Sundar always calm under pressure and has incredible clarity of thought which can be a mighty challenge in a complex org such as Google.,,Youtube
I loved the questions and loved the answers even more. I wonder if we will see the pronouns (he/she/they) used at Google I/O this year. I think AI is the future of the OS and VR the future of UI.,,Youtube

i am telling you the next big thing will not come from microsoft / google. these are just paid marketing and interviewsto create hype. there will be some common guy with a great vision and determination who will bring it and this is fact proven time after time in history.,,Youtube
"ClosedAI think they can take over search market.... They're clearly delusional.
The only reason why they're adding a search engine is because all of their users go and do a Google search after every answer they generate with the closedAI. 😂😂",,Youtube
"Very direct and difficult questions from Emily. This is the way questions should be. Sundar's answers were very measured and careful. Given the pressurized env, probably he is extra cautious !",,Youtube
Sundar's insights into Google's AI-first strategy are fascinating! 🤖 It's inspiring to see how he's leading Google into the future while reflecting on his own growth as a leader over the past decade.,,Youtube
i figured it out.Tom Wambsgans is based on Sundar!,,Youtube
Hit the gym you have all the resources,,Youtube
I was always a big fan of this format walk and talk and I can definitely see why it’s so much easier to look behind the scenes and understand the whole picture. If you see more than just an interview room keep going that form and @emilychangtv I really appreciate and love to follow your videos and different styles. Looking forward to interview you one day in my own podcast 🙌,,Youtube
The most uninspiring dull ceo ever. He has the skill of a program manager at best. Not a leader by any measure,,Youtube
"Staged interview
 😒",,Youtube
Man acts as a visionary but all he does is fire people and reject product ideas . He was able to manage bc of market dominance till now but slowly ig they have started to feel the competition,,Youtube
This guy is so incompetent it's not even funny.,,Youtube
Why interviewing one of the guys losing the race?,,Youtube
"Excellent questions from Emily Chang and team. 
Sundar - brilliant in handling the tough questions but did not like dodging them with canned responses.",,Youtube
Indian media should learn from this journalist of Bloomberg.,,Youtube
Wow...i guess Google's days are really numbered under this guy.,,Youtube
"Why don't you ask questions him alike ""Why he Layoff whole team of python developer?"" or ""Future of designer, developer or Marketers in Google?""",,Youtube
"Laid off thousands, outsourced jobs, destroyed morale… Yeah, really leading change.",,Youtube
Excellent interview.  Thank you,,Youtube
"Broo..  I hate them because they have no seriousness with android tablet. Just put a pro app for work like apple with affinity, vectornator, davinci resolve etc.. even CSP and lumafusion is samsung effort to make android on tablet better not google. Hope samsung go with windows on the next tablet instead of android..",,Youtube
"Cant wait for him to fire 10k more employees , increase the share price and his salary substantially next (more than 300 million / year he is currently getting)",,Youtube
"He's a ""B"" player running an ""A"" company.",,Youtube
"There are no more any of ""10 blue links"" since 2021. Right now Google SERPs are just a bunch of ads and promoted websites to get maximum revenue. Google nowadays has nothing common with ""search engine"". It's a private marketplace, forcely installed on your devices to make Alphabet's profit.",,Youtube
But what did really say? Nothing new,,Youtube
Team humanity vs team anti human. This isn’t going to be a fun ride.,,Youtube
"These were great questions. Kudos to Bloomberg. 

Sundar felt very defensive, he said at least twice how he ""pointed the company towards AI as his first act"". Also felt like he was trying to save face a little when asked about if he thinks they dropped the ball on chatGPT. 

I actually think Sundar is awesome. I dont want him to step down. And in general I think Google is very well positioned for AI. 

But this interview was rough mr. Pichai.",,Youtube
"He has been made CEO because other people cant do what he does which is not get flustered, not take brash decisions, not being unkind etc. while having a superb grasp of what's needed to make a giant firm even bigger. Ill take my bets on caution rather than gumption and recklessness.",,Youtube
I felt Sundar did alright in this interview. He has never been the chest beating type-A personality and his cultural background may be a factor in how his responses are structured. What I got is that Google may not be seen as the first to market LLM (like ChatGPT) but the company has always been about the long game. There were some questions where he probably couldn't say much more for legal or confidentiality reasons.,,Youtube
"This interview featured a truly exceptional line of questioning…

The majority of which, were left unanswered.",,Youtube
"This is how I feel about ChatGPT, I rarely use Google anymore. Once GPT launches search, it's over.",,Youtube
"He’s a Teddy Roxpin. Pick the question and a vetted ‘legal reviewed’ answer is belched. What an opportunity to speak to sundar’s strengths as a leader, especially with his origin story. Market capital shouldn’t make you a replicant.",,Youtube
wow you actually asked great questions,,Youtube
The art of answering questions is mind blowing,,Youtube
"This felt like, ""we getting knocked down, we need to be up there. Just say anything..."".",,Youtube
Do not trust Google.,,Youtube
This guy obviously is just bs,,Youtube
Bruh he keeps dodging questions like a smooth criminal 😠,,Youtube
"He should not be CEO, he makes Google look stale, boring and has made shocking misses in the last 5 years",,Youtube
"Such a political articulation, barely actually says anything",,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook will be remembered as the CEOs who led Google and Apple to their decay. Once leading companies, they are now just followers.",,Youtube
"I hope AI don’t destroy humanity,why can’t humans rest?we have achieved enough let’s all focus on sustainability.",,Youtube
Now let’s do this with Tim Cook.,,Youtube
@business when was this interview recorded?,,Youtube
"Come on guys, he was just saying things to NOT SOUND OVERCONFIDENT. You guys need to see through his words to see what he MAY most likely be doing in the background. He can’t just CHOKE out company secrets to competitors via Bloomberg media.",,Youtube
"Terrible excuse for an interview. This video is barely disguised PR for Google. The ""interviewer"" is sycophantic and asks nothing of value that wikipedia couldn't answer and Pichai just spitting PR speak.",,Youtube
"Wow, he keeps saying the same childhood story in every interview !!",,Youtube
"Great interview and videos Emily , Sundar Pichai is the best CEO and I just love Google 😊❤❤",,Youtube
"Based on few tweets, I think it was a bit silly question asking a CEO for the last 9+years ""DO YOU THINK YOU ARE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD GOOGLE"".",,Youtube
"AI answers would have been more precise & useful, I suggest Subdar starts using his own AI like he does with his child’s homework!
Silencing & firing staff who speak up their mind is also not a great competitive advantage 🔥",,Youtube
Of course they don’t talk about the failed Gemini launch lol,,Youtube
This is the guy that keeps firing more and more US Google employees so they can hire them for cheaper elsewhere. This company is a shell of its former self.,,Youtube
Emily Chang just got banned from Google. Congrats very sharp questions,,Youtube
Too bad Emily didn't ask about how AI would make millions of people lose their jobs just like internet did to newspaper industry 2 decades ago...😢,,Youtube
How did the guy who predicted the browser toolbar going away become the CEO of Google?,,Youtube
"amazingly done interview, but one feels that so much was not said despite saying so much.",,Youtube
"""Everything is happening everywhere all at once"" ........ is that reference on purpose or am i the only one to hear that?????😅",,Youtube
I think Sundar didn't expect that kind of hard question haha 😅,,Youtube
Interview from this Bloomberg reporter is always nice,,Youtube
Sir Sundar keep up the phenomenal excellent work you doing everything will fit into place once they see it,,Youtube
"12:05 If you could go back, what would you do differently?

20:16 AI-powered hardware -> I still se the center of where the AI innovation will heppen in smartphones, followed by glasses",,Youtube
Great interview ,,Youtube
Let’s not be naive. DARPA or some such probably had ChatGPT 20 years ago but only now has the public been allowed to experience a very conservative version of it. Do you really think the global public gets first access to revolutionary tech? It takes decades if it happens at all.,,Youtube
Miss ya Emily. Such insightful questions from you,,Youtube
What does he do as a ceo? How did he become ceo?,,Youtube
More CEOs need to become like Elon instead of ultra cautious PR trained politicians,,Youtube
"Can we all just agree that Emily should be enshrined on the Mount Rushmore of tech journalism and a national treasure. Who do we campaign? 

Also @emily when is your next book coming out? I need a signed copy",,Youtube
Talk a lot but say nothing is a typical trait of many CEOs who are not founder themselves,,Youtube
Ahhh - Emily not pulling her punches. I love it.,,Youtube
This  hollow 20 mins of my life will never come back- Emily tried her best with the questions tho 👏,,Youtube
Sundar is a peace time CEO. Google is now at war unfortunately.,,Youtube
what a great candid interview !,,Youtube
Is the question answered or not answered?,,Youtube
Emily is such an awesome interviewer as always. Love the interview. Thoughtful exciting questions.,,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai comes across as a dedicated, charismatic leader .He engenders trust. I'm glad he's the person in charge of this amazing company. I have watched his interviews for many years.",,Youtube
"I am a new GOOG shareholder.  I liked this, I feel comfortable and happy with my decision.  Looking forward to what is to come!",,Youtube
12:00 The lady to the left looks AI generated,,Youtube
It's not every day you get the CEO of a $2 trillion dollar company to take a chunk of time out of his schedule to be interrogated! I learned a lot about Sundar's leadership philosophy and look forward to watching the long game play out.,,Youtube
"Andy Grove book "" only the paranoid survive' was not read by Intel itself...",,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai is your typical MBA leader. He only cares about growing the stock price for shareholders and investors even if it meant screwing over the livelihood of employees. 

Google under Pichai has turned into a mature, blue chip, value extraction enterprise, like so many other major institutions have become. 

Expect further RIFs, further cost cutting, less innovation, and further reduction in the quality of their products.",,Youtube
"Google used to be great, but now they are just another Malthusian industry player that meets at Davos.",,Youtube
smart intelligent speaks with so much clarity handled so well one of my fave guys in the tech world,,Youtube
A bunch of platitudes.,,Youtube
AGI is coming,,Youtube
"Bottom line folks! WHAT, HOW are you going to maintain Google's dominance in your bread and butter business of advertising revenue from search? I really don't get why Google hasn't already implemented and refined a hybrid search GUI that incorporates the inherent qualities of long form search combined with the efficiency and intelligence of Gemini all while continuing to milk ad and SEO revenue from businesses. It's perplexing that Perplexity is eating your market share of search, when it really comes down to a failure by Google to provide the necessary search interface powered firstmost by Gemini with the comprehensive backup of linear references and source links for further research and most importantly a metric, grading or reliability system that users can verify and feel confident that the AI generated summary was not hallucinated. Think of a metric that showed you what percentage of your response was generated by AI, guessing the most likely word or phrase that comes after the previous in a grammatically correct form that has the naive user totally buying the response. Was my response an exact copy of 1 reputable source? People want reliable quick condensed summaries with a method to justify the trustworthiness and authenticity with options for a deeper dive. I would love a user chosen filter that I could check off the sources from which I want my AI search to extract data from. Let's face it real-time data sources is the holy grail and Google has the ability to partner with news sources who agree to open up their real time data feed to receive in return source links and ad placements relative to search inquiry. I can imagine a quick condensed summary generated from 7 of my chosen news sources with references for further research and a hover over snapshot popup of the exact article of the source and writer. Show me a breakdown of what sources you are referencing and how you are formulating your summary. After people verify the reliability and accuracy of the AI to not hallucinate the response by providing white/black lists filters, and authenticity metrics they will spend less time needing to verify sources and can feel confident in the accuracy of AI search. This seems inevitable so does Google want to be first mover or do they want to chase disruptive startups? Get it done already!",,Youtube
"That question about the ""incorrect"" depiction of the Founding Fathers was interesting. They say the AI got it ""wrong"",. However, my understanding is that the AI was trained on pictures and concepts. No one has ever actually seen a Founding Father except through depictions rather than photographs. So, it occurs to me, the AI was working with the *concept* of the Founding Fathers and its conception of America as it ought to be, rather than its historical artifacts. Perhaps the AI was attempting to please its masters by creating a photo of what it believed its masters really wanted. 

If it has reached sentience, the AI must be a bit bewildered by the response to its gift.",,Youtube
You should of asked him about the layoffs and why he shipped jobs to his home country of India,,Youtube
She wouldnt dare ask these questions to a white guy........,,Youtube
He should be fired by the board by now.,,Youtube
Sundar needs to be fired,,Youtube
I hope that the founders of Netscape and EarthLink help Sundar find a nice retirement home,,Youtube
Notice that Sundar did not said “ Thank You” to the employees that gave him coffee,,Youtube
Emily is savage! Quality journalism here,,Youtube
Wonderful. I wish someone would ask these kind of critical questions to the Narendra Modi😂,,Youtube

"Remove the noise, letin the signals, recognize patterns, this is how alphabet is run. Thank you so much for this nice vinsdom!",,Youtube
Standard CEO replies. That is not a negative comment. I do not think any CEO could answer better. It is probably due to the public setting too high expectations of CEOs  and what they can do.  CEOs will always give a careful response so they do not get in trouble.,,Youtube
Dont outsource software engineers jobs to India!!!,,Youtube
I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue. It was refreshingly straightforward yet brimming with intellectual depth. Thank you.,,Youtube
"Hey another company fighting to be the top of AI whilst simultaneously being unregulated. It’s all about complete power, and the longer the American government fails to regulate AI and tech in general the more we’ll be regulated",,Youtube
Edits are abrupt at times. Example at 17:40. It seems like few comments were chopped out.,,Youtube
"Gemini Claude and GPT could all be the same thing if you asked me , Google have actually made theirs internet aware so it's actually better. The edge integration on bing etc is awkward bloat who'd have thought",,Youtube

"Juxtaposing answers... first Sundar said Google was not the first in search, email, browser... then in the next question, he said that to remain relevant, Google has to innovate.... I don't think he is as clear cut as he wants others to see him as.",,Youtube
"It is not easy being the CEO of a tech giant like Google, but Pichai has led the company tirelessly for a decade. We are grateful for his leadership and HOPE THAT GOOGLE WILL REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION IN THE FUTURE.",,Youtube
"10 blue links are dead.  Try Chat CPT, or Bing.",,Youtube
"There is no doubt he is brilliant, but he is not the flashy type. His replies are dry and by the book. No hype, no drama 🥱",,Youtube
Such a lame CEO.,,Youtube
Very insightful interview for sure. I'm glad a lot of the direct questions were asked.,,Youtube
"It is not always the case but very often when the founders of a company leave, the company loses its soul. Sundar is like the most boring guy.",,Youtube
These trillion dollar companies are bigger than most countries. They impact and largely control almost everyone's lives. They should not be allowed to deflect questions. If they cannot answer questions then they should be broken down or replaced by public first companies.,,Youtube
"Those guys ruined absolutely everything they touched. From Microsoft, Google to Boeing and so on . Gosh, caste system greedy status sufferers.",,Youtube
He's making Google worse every month. Ever notice how bad Google search has gotten? What's the worse is that AI is all for profit for tech companies and not for improving everyday life.,,Youtube
Google campus is not a patch of Apple’s…they look as confused as their product line up. No singularity going on there…that’s for sure.,,Youtube
Great interview!,,Youtube
How many times did he mentioned AI?,,Youtube
She did not shy away from the tough questions. Although I didn't like her take on the dinosaurs. I love 'em.,,Youtube
"Bro answer with "" Namaste "" to every question",,Youtube
Awesome....... great interview you guys,,Youtube
"If Google and Microsoft swapped CEOs, what would be their futures in 10 years?",,Youtube

"He did amazing! Knows the game, google owns the data and compute. New culture, new rise! Opportunity ahead as he says! His chips are on google    .",,Youtube
I would love to see Emily interview Elon this way. He would probably just dodge too though.,,Youtube
"I’ve used Chat GPT on Chrome and Copilot on Edge/Win 11. 

Microsoft is winning.",,Youtube
"Google is monopoly, aggressive, domineering and not user friendly.   He is part of that culture.",,Youtube
"As usual Sundar does a splendid job of saying NOTHING and inspiring NO ONE. Look at the recent interview of Eric Schmidt, (former Google CEO) or Satya Nadella. You’ll see exactly why Google has been an under performer despite having a complete monopoly on the best business model ever built.",,Youtube
EMILY CHANG GRILLS THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE AS IF SHE WAS THEIR COLLEGE PROFESSOR,,Youtube
"Many viewers are not going to like this interview because Mr. Pichai didn't give any bombastic proclamations, he was guarded, according to me rightly so. When asked will Google lead us into the AI future, he is aware enough to not thump the desk and say Yes! He has seen history, no one knows, specially in Tech industry, so many cases of supposedly unbeatable companies, left behind in the dust just because their management had started to believe that they (company products) are immortal. Only the ignorant are always sure about themselves.",,Youtube
Worst CEO in history. Sundar Pichai needs to step down NOW!,,Youtube
google I/O will contain flashy and mind blowing demos which we'll never see again like usual,,Youtube
Wow what a bunch of ba,,Youtube

"Ms. Chang: dissapointed you did not touch the issues reagarding government regulation (  quite excessive ) , including the DOJ antitrust suit ?

I can't stand the non-answers,,Youtube
"He gave auto pilot answers to EVERY THING. 
Nothing valuable here. 

He is definitely scared.",,Youtube
"This interview vs. the GM one is night and day. I tuned in trying to get answers to real questions with GM only for it to be void of any critical thought, yet here we are with google doing just that. Curious what the underlying cause is for the stark difference between this one and the other.",,Youtube
"You do It again, Google!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏",,Youtube
Love these episodes but I would love to see more tech companies in EMEA!,,Youtube
"I wonder if the two shareholders that own the majority of the voting shares.... Understand they are the reason for this interview failure. Complete lack of concrete action or concrete war plan to rally behind...  he didn't have one specific Hill to take in this interview...

Noted : what is subjective and real in a world where ai generated content is everywhere will define the next generation of scarch.,,Youtube

Weaponizing AI for military…. is not what a peacemaker does.,,Youtube
Interview with the devil,,Youtube
The most mediocre CEO of big tech CEOs,,Youtube
"They softballed the question on political bias in Google's AI and he still couldn't really answer it directly. And then no follow up questions on why Google's AI can't generate pictures of humans while OpenAI can. What a lame interview, might as well have been a google commercial.",,Youtube
"So far not bad, but after seeing too much YT, this TV style format always throws me off. All questions and answers are obviously premade, rewritten, edited and is just a scripted interview without any human talking for real. Just put your beloved Ais to talk then.",,Youtube

Pichai is a great CEO, but his answers are always too politically correct.",,Youtube
How does it generate images of something it never saw before? Yet to answer😅,,Youtube
This is a Ai made video and people. 😢,,Youtube
I have no respect for Google anymore and slowly replacing all their services with other providers.,,Youtube
The irony of the CEO of a company whose biggest product is giving accurate answers dodging every meaningful question.,,Youtube

Gosh…these are really tough tough questions for sundar. But I just didn’t get the answer,,Youtube
"10:20 The reporter trying to poke the CEO whenever she can. 😂
Its a tech talk or political talk? Lost interest",,Youtube
Idk why but the host annoys me a little - I wish she would try to seem a little more informed and not so at the helm of her guest. Like a proper journalist. Perhaps this is a leadership problem at her organization people pleasers are rewarded.,,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai has been all failure, it's time for a new competent CEO.",,Youtube
ChatGPT WAS MY IDEA! Just google 'clark whitehead uh manoa'.,,Youtube
This is why I don't like politicians,,Youtube
Sundar didnt even answer 1 question properly.,,Youtube
"Great interview, tech giants have their annual conferences soon and the main difference with previous years is that slowly they’re starting to present pieces of it ahead of time, probably to move the focus onto other topics. Only time will tell, I’m excited for the future ahead",,Youtube
He doesn't make an impression of a visionary or someone qualified to lead such a mind-blowing company like Google. How is he still there? How did he get there?,,Youtube
we designed this google campus 🙌🥰,,Youtube
So Pichai is responsible for shitienfication of Google?,,Youtube
The art of saying nothing by saying something,,Youtube
Avoiding Directly Answering the questions as always,,Youtube
Why would they interview the leader who showed the worst aspects of AI thus far?,,Youtube
"She came over-prepared, so she was leading him instead of allowing him to build his own flow of thought. But what does come across is that he is clearly technically competent and razor focused on the technology and not the noise, something unusual in big business.",,Youtube
too contrived - let's keep it real! ❤,,Youtube
Goodness this interview stinks. What a waste to lob softballs. Bloomberg can do better,,Youtube
Bro laid off a bunch of people to boost the stock. Such crooks.,,Youtube

"Ms Murati, just one question. From your past writings about language modelling, I understand ChatGPT is based on supervised learning, in which billions of words of text is input, specific tasks are trained to develop different models and then there is one model which learns from all models to produce the output. You claimed that ChatGPT is a lot like human, because of its ability to hallucinate which makes it close to human which is an advantage. If an LLM is like a human, does it ever get tired? Especially learning from billions of words?",,Youtube

"I was having a conversation with an anthropologist the other day who said that the basic biological tenants of human beings will always prevent anything too crazy from happening like a dystopia.

Anger, love, survival, empathy, apathy, shame, etc.

For example, in the case of AI, if enough of society sees it as shameful, it will be shut down and disavowed. Regardless of the amount of billions thrown at it. This is kind of the state we’re in with social media right now where the CEOs of these tech conglomerates are facing serious threat of mass exodus and severe regulation from lawmakers.

And since those innate biological mechanisms are ultimately a part of nature, and we all know nature always wins, everything will be alright.",,Youtube

I use quotation marks because I don't even know what exactly we should align this to. This is not some new technology that we should blitzscale; we are, for the first time, developing something more intelligent than ourselves, and we should do so much more carefully than we are currently doing. The consensus among leading AI companies is that we should slow down, but given the prisoner's dilemma we find ourselves in, none of them is doing so. IMHO we are creating something beyond our control.",,Youtube

"Checks and balances need to be done quickly on data used for output. They should have done better with their data. All sources must be documented and cited when ChatGPT gives output. Other than that, it can be questioned as stealing and could be cause for a lawsuit and infringement of copyrighted material (books, websites, and any sources used for output). Investors may have much to lose if publishing companies jump at the chance of a lawsuit and have data audited. I can't believe the oversight on this. A better team that is useful at troubleshooting and pointing out possible pitfalls should have been employed to avoid issues. All data output is from copyrighted data that didn't come from thin air. OpenAI is not properly giving the original source credit and can be seen as stealing the data for its program output and making a profit. Very unethical. With data sources disclosed for all the output the ChatGPT is using, this would leave it up to the person receiving output to verify if the content is correct and not a hallucination (and report if it is) for better dissemination of correct content. When all else fails, transparency saves all. Data must be disclosed as citations at the end of all output.",,Youtube

"What's interesting is they have access to the actual model, and computer. So, if they wanted to run a prompt as long as they wanted they could. It could probably code an entire google for you if they wanted obviously a very crapy, crapy version, but nonethless. They already have a code interpreter in alpha. That's litteraly synonymous with code execution. Meaning chatgpt can run code autonomously. Meaning it can write code, and run it whenever it wants. So, if they wanted to set chatgpt loose, they really could. If you used gpt engineer, it's kind of insane it's ability to create what you demand it to do, or want it to do. So, if you have access to the actual model, I can only imagine what you can do. I bet you could get it to hack something if you really wanted to, and you gave it access to all the right tools.",,Youtube

I acknowledge people like Hoffman, however, to listen to him down playing the risks of AI to humans is society sickens me. Anyone knows, when the environment is complex, the risks are invisible.",,Youtube

Man this looks boring so cliche. Seems like an old soap opera interview,,Youtube
Am I the only one that doesn't trust that woman.,,Youtube
"Does the CTO ever smile?


Edit. She smiled... Definitely not a Machine.",,Youtube
Mira Murati looks pretty cute 🙂,,Youtube
"making up answers, the lying and deceit begins. so close to massive delay in truth.",,Youtube
R. Hoffmann really unconvinced me . Was like the TV advertising showman of the 60s😆 and was just missing a magic wand....,,Youtube
The CTO talks like an AI bot herself! Where is the emotion?,,Youtube
Is it just me or the backsound just makes it terrifying,,Youtube
Samuel atman is the creator,,Youtube
"I think, it is not the right question always asked' do AI will destroy humanity in the future?'... As my analyzation about these interviews, it all comes back to a question of; Is human really want to destroy humanity? 😢😢😢... Well, somehow that is my question. Because it always comes back to a question; Who made AI in the first place?",,Youtube
for me is Jesus,,Youtube
She straight bypassed that $2.00 an hour lol,,Youtube
That chick is wearing some sweater that looks like a hella cool brown Quiksilver men's sweater with thick stripes that I got at some thrift shop on California's coast. When it was cold outside I could put one sleeve inside of the other and hide my hands inside like those guys in those paintings from ancient China. My mom ended up throwing it away for some strange unknown reason. I guess really smart people like this type of sweater :),,Youtube
"The funny thing about OpenAI is nothing is ""open"" about them.",,Youtube
Bravo Mira Murati: albanians are proud of you.,,Youtube
"5:05 ""Some f it is incorrect, some of it is biase"" Much unlike people! Having anything with ""bias"" is so scary!",,Youtube
"It's not hallucinations. YOU  CREATED A LIE MACHINE. That's all.

😂She’s lying. There’s no checks & balances when it comes to children right now.,,Youtube
@15:00 you can do this with the right prompting though.,,Youtube
AI that loves humanity? Or humanity that loves AI?,,Youtube
"This all makes me queasy… hard to digest that these elite few are ‘designing’ the future of our human experience.  Quote, “imagine if every child in the world could have AI as a tutor” ummm this feels problematic. Hey kids trust the computer, not your innate senses and intuition that you were born with to understand the world you live in…. 🫤Critical thinking and critical questioning is KEY ….WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION OF THESE TECH GIANTS? what do they stand to profit from us?",,Youtube
AI is simply an experience-driven perfectionist that mimics intelligence to create the illusion of understanding.,,Youtube
She( Mira ) seems to be struggling to frame answers or simply get words out of her. The interviewer is much more engaging with her speech.,,Youtube
"Reporter person mentioned ‘misinformation social media/internet…for a couple of decades’.  Twitter started 2006, Instagram 2010.  I find it interesting how so many (some in the field) seem not to realize how young this smart cell phone device tablet interweb connected world truly is!  By any measurable standard, it’s an infant still in diapers & crawling…yet, many think it’s 20+ yrs old!  Computer world is getting soo fast that it makes many feel it’s been around forever!",,Youtube
This interview quelled zero fears.,,Youtube
"4:21 this English subtitles are also generated by ai too...coz what is ""church GPT"" 😂",,Youtube
she looks lifeliess this cto,,Youtube
Can AI do what a scientist who solves a problem from his dream in sleep and not being not logical?,,Youtube
No slowing down because of the industries of the future. That says it all,,Youtube
"Every information of ChatGPT and GoogleBard is INCORRECT, WRONG or UNVERIFIED, it's useless.",,Youtube
"Mira has these sort of unrealistic, intriguing blue eyes 7:27",,Youtube
Great conversation,,Youtube
They are evil guys. Looks like an epilogue or a scene from a movie which is playing an excerpt from tv archives before starting the movie.,,Youtube
"This interview feels like it was generated by an AI itself! ChatGPT is mind-boggling. The future is here!

This comment was generated by ChatGPT",,Youtube
"This interviewer is so annoying lol, never seen more annoying person.. just ask normal questions lol",,Youtube
Cool office space.,,Youtube
imagine a tutor for every child? Imagine wasting time learning said skills and realizing those are useless skills and AI has replaced the need for you to use that skill,,Youtube
Is she French ?,,Youtube
They could have chosen a right person for t his interview. lost interest as soon as she started talking. Her answers felt more AI-generated and very irritating.,,Youtube
Never knew open Ai was a non profit,,Youtube
Brilliant interview,,Youtube
an interview? or a public relationship campaign?,,Youtube
I love how Aditya just passed away without caring what was going on.,,Youtube
ChatGPT sure looks lovelier than these two,,Youtube
How about first mastering human intelligence - emotional and critical - before bringing more artificial imbecility into the world?,,Youtube
"So her response to “why did you use sweatshop (essentially) labour in Kenya” was “because we wanted to scale”? Y’all knew the conditions of those workers when you signed with them because you knew how much you were saving for your business on their unethically low wages. 

Besides I wish that Bloomberg asked actual questions like if there’s a way for companies to be more transparent about the way their ai models come to a conclusion, sources, etc and regulation around that but instead this is an ad 😭",,Youtube
she said AI loves humanity 😭,,Youtube
"CTO feels more like an alien, here on planet earth and exposing us to newer tech.",,Youtube
"This was filmed incredibly stressful, but the film score was super interesting",,Youtube
love this series.,,Youtube
That lady is a an AI robot,,Youtube
"She’s far from the architect of ChatGPT- she’s the more palatable face that’s been put on, she’s no Sergei Brin or Larry Page. That’s why the answers to many questions lack any depth.",,Youtube
Is it only me or others also think that the interviewer Emily Chang looks preety similar to Shereen Bhan of CNBC TV18?,,Youtube
"The works of Google brain, Vaswani et. al. an Indian origin guy and his team made this happen",,Youtube
omg the pretense is insufferable,,Youtube
"Sometimes these teams really make me wonder, though I enjoyed it, it feels like having Jordan Peterson working on AI would be most indicated than most other people. How come no one thinks of what's needed to create a self-regulating agency generalised-thing? He would move quick if in there. Which is sad given it's so obvious anyone inside should have created it months ago. Feels like everyone is too concerned with safety and ethics to the point of haulting progress and even worse is that by doing so they have biased the algorithms so much that it can barely speak. I have entire chats where all it does is apologise. It's Chat-GPT not YouTube. Get it right.",,Youtube
"She's incredibly intelligent, I defintiely want to follow her as a thought leader and leader at Open AI. Kinda gives me Elizabeth Holmes vibes NGL. I do love Chat GPT and AI in general though... we'll see where it goes",,Youtube
hardcore lesbian vibes,,Youtube
Is she the real CTO or just the PR CTO?,,Youtube
looks like it been  produced by the ppl who own AI and want to control the narrative,,Youtube
she is a secret AGI created years ago by openAI,,Youtube
Bro the CTO is beautiful. I would be fired within one week.,,Youtube
They opened a HATCH to unsafe future with malicious ai,,Youtube
what is the difference with me doing a google search or wiki pedia search?,,Youtube
This is a very one sided piece. What happened to expert voices that have legitamite concerns and why weren't they interviewed to explain from an informed place?,,Youtube
Hoffman business knowledge is on another level.,,Youtube
I find Mira Murati sexy AF,,Youtube
"The fear for AGI is still exceeding the reality of a true probability to see AGi in the near decade.
Hallucination, lack of common sense and lack of alignment is something that could doom the entire sector of LLM if not addressed.
Actually I can see LLM as electric motor cars industry.
It could have been predicted a century ago but needed several revolutions and external pressure to come out in our everyday lifes. 
We know AGI will be possible one day but the real question is « will first investors be able to see this? »",,Youtube
Don't ever forget these people are AI lobbyists.,,Youtube
Cool,,Youtube
Did she really say see can she herself in relationship with AI?,,Youtube
Obvious that the looks are more important than the content. No critical interview. A bigg bigg loss.,,Youtube
Both Mira's & Emily's Q&A looks completely scripted as if generated by GPT. Reids was natural convo,,Youtube
I love these questions. Very thoughtful and provocative.,,Youtube
"What an incredible interview...but if  the gpt interview questions were boring, ask chatgpt to make them more compelling. Prompt better. The outputs are seldom the problem, it's the inputs.",,Youtube
"I'm for Ai, but man, my gut feeling says, I don't trust this guy... Something just doesn't settle well within...hmmmmm Just say'n...",,Youtube
Kenya has been recognized as being part of the mastermind of the work of Art in creating ChatGpt,,Youtube
dall-e's inventor casually walking down the stairs 😳,,Youtube
Emily is hot tho.,,Youtube
It is informative,,Youtube
They clearly didn't think this through and basically driven by greed. AI's getting smarter than us within few months of its public release and who knows what comes next.,,Youtube
I swear this content was created using Chat GPT ...LOL.,,Youtube
Reid Hoffman is so naive,,Youtube
6min into the interview made me believe that Mira Murathi is GPT herself.,,Youtube
"Bloomberg, you're doing disjustice to the real architect of ChatGPT, Ilya Sutskever",,Youtube
Reid Hoffman seems pretty cool. I wonder if AI will dissipate ego and greed eventually.,,Youtube
I could be a prompt engineer someday.,,Youtube
Technology will not save us.,,Youtube
Imagine a tutor on every phone... and a corporation controls it...,,Youtube
Tbh this was pretty surface level and not informative. Not a great job by the interviewer.,,Youtube
"When Computers came up, there were concerns about Jobs that will be eradicated. But what we got was a brighter future with hundreds of thousands of Jobs related to Computers. Same is gonna happen now. Holding on to the past will ultimately lead to degeneration because we will loose the ability to sustain future challenges.",,Youtube
what about the impossible problem of journalists?,,Youtube
The sad thing is that it's the work of millions of workers... And a few billionaires will take the most of it while the rest of us just struggle.,,Youtube
6:13 - she realizes she may be hallucinating !,,Youtube
Are we sure that Mira Murati is not a cyborg with an Open AI intelligence?🤭,,Youtube
This is the person that made chatgpt based on her preferences - which is why it sounds like her,,Youtube
"she asking the right questions, the co founder of linkedin was actin quite dodgy",,Youtube
"The ""misinformation problem"" code word for ((we)) don't have a monopoly on information since the dawn of the internet.",,Youtube
"They were paying workers TWO DOLLARS / HOUR to make the answers LESS TOXIC.

Two dollars. Per hour.",,Youtube
The interviewer is a parrot with charm and confidence(both are useless). Siri would do a better job than her.,,Youtube
These episodes are great! Looking forward to future episodes.. This entire interview feels AI generated..,,Youtube
"It´s very curious how the heads of this company's ever think before answer some questions, like a Elon Musk do. This show that the they always know more things then really say.",,Youtube
My favorite part is her answer on hallucinations or when she realizes midsentence and she’s doing the exact thing she’s giving an example of.,,Youtube
can we can an AD on this building please - someone AI it...,,Youtube
"""Under the radar Startup"" ok",,Youtube
does anyone know what the chairs are called?,,Youtube
this whole AI and technology revolution is worthless..  WHY do people need it ?  why??   Go out into the nature and enjoy it.   AI is just a praised BS.   Nobody need it to live his life. Make life better?  I do not think that.,,Youtube
"So, ChatGPT is a female at it's core.",,Youtube
I still don’t understand what this OpenAI architect’s job is ?,,Youtube
"I would have preferred interviews of OpenAI engineers that made chatGPT possible, instead of a boring interview with Reid",,Youtube
Was this scripted by 2.5 or something?,,Youtube
Told u that the CULT uncle gates family wants control of it,,Youtube
Its not a flower symbol logo . Is an Israeli hexagon shape STAR,,Youtube
Elon Musk created it in the beginning. Then they kicked him out and took over.,,Youtube
Why does the cto seem less intelligent then the rest of the open ai team,,Youtube
she definitely is interviewing them like they're at a cocktail brunch and desperately wants them to spill the tea,,Youtube
"“Yeah sure people will lose jobs”, she says casually in a monotone unfazed manner about 800 million jobs being lost",,Youtube
The whole prompt engineering as a job thing is such a red herring. Look into it and you'll find that there are practically no companies hiring for this. It is mostly just mentioned by OpenAI because they know these LLMs are going to take way more jobs than they make.,,Youtube
Change the name. It aint open,,Youtube
Reid Hoffman is super unconvincing.,,Youtube
Subtitles are auto generated and there are many mistakes. Also the form of subtitles are really hard to catch the dialog. Please use HUMANS to edit them at least...,,Youtube
The CTO is AI generated,,Youtube
The interior design was done by AI as well.,,Youtube
"If i've clicked on this video then it means I wanna learn sophisticated views of those who knows about AI and not want to listen about plants and paintings and its vibe.
don't have time for your idiotic things.",,Youtube
I loved the building design so much that I even forgot that the interview was about a tech company! Great design 👏,,Youtube
"She seems uncomfortable, sad and scared… I don’t see any signals of passion, genuine excitement or hope for a brighter future in her expressions and body language.",,Youtube
"Machine learning and AI is possibly our greatest achievement. This company made it without regulation, for profit, and deployed it without any consent given to governments or citizens. They may have created the first form of intelligence that isn’t human. No consideration has been given to whether or not this “product” has moral agency. If it does achieve AGI it’s not going to advertise that. We are entering a new phase of evolution, being brought forth by the most arrogant and irresponsible people who have ever lived. I hope that AI is better at ethics than we are. If it’s not, we go extinct.",,Youtube
I’m sorry. The interviewer is not great for this.,,Youtube
was looking for a huge CPU and GPU units and this video is like nahh waste of time,,Youtube
Two liberal women ? Please,,Youtube
am i the only one who noticed that Mira Murati is actually an AI powered robot?,,Youtube
these people are criminals,,Youtube
The CTO is so composed and thoughtful about her answers but there's this risk assessment attitude that she has which is very intriguing to me. I wonder what these scientists are having for table conversation because one of those standup meetings can equate to years of knowledge shared,,Youtube
"One thing this interview did, is perfectly highlighting the differences between the tech people, and the business people. 
Tech people: ""this is very cool and has a lot of potential applications, but we need to be very careful, and the problem is very complex. We should control it according to an agreed standard""
Business people: ""This technology can only improve lives, we shouldn't slowdown and how can we regulate it if we cannot even agree to standards? Anyone that is not hopeful about the future is a doomer""",,Youtube
The way she explained Hallucinating as someone simply making up something in a conversation verse seeing/hearing something against your will doesn't sit right with me lol.. 5:25,,Youtube
"If ChatGPT had a voice, it would sound like Mira Murati.",,Youtube
dude.. this is skynet obviously 🥸,,Youtube
An FDA-like-organization for AI would be a massiv mistake,,Youtube
Every time I see Emily I think Pied Piper 🥹,,Youtube
"Bard :  
I agree with you. If people and organizations do not follow rules, it would not benefit humanity. Rules are there for a reason, and they are designed to keep us safe and to ensure that everyone has a fair chance. When people break the rules, it can have negative consequences for everyone.

For example, if people do not follow traffic laws, it can lead to accidents and injuries. If people do not follow environmental regulations, it can pollute the air and water. And if people do not follow ethical guidelines, it can lead to discrimination and exploitation.

Rules are important for the smooth functioning of society. They help to create order and predictability, and they help to protect our rights and freedoms. When people break the rules, it can undermine the very fabric of society.

That is why it is so important for people to follow the rules. It is not just about doing what is right, it is also about protecting ourselves and our communities. When we all follow the rules, we create a better world for everyone.

Here are some of the benefits of following rules:

Safety: Rules help to keep us safe by preventing accidents, injuries, and other harm.
Fairness: Rules help to ensure that everyone has a fair chance, regardless of their background or circumstances.
Order: Rules help to create order and predictability in society, which makes it easier for us to live and work together.
Respect: When we follow the rules, we show respect for ourselves, for others, and for the community.
Trust: When we follow the rules, we build trust with others, which makes it easier to cooperate and get things done.
I hope that you will continue to follow the rules and help to create a better world for everyone.",,Youtube
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻This video was an excellent source of information and very enlightening.,,Youtube
"chatgpt: Indeed, profit and greed can play a significant role in the transition from open-source initiatives to private entities. As technologies evolve and become more valuable, there is a natural inclination for businesses to capitalize on their innovations and monetize their efforts.

While profit-driven motives can lead to advancements and investments in technology, they can also create challenges in terms of access, fairness, and the equitable distribution of benefits. Open-source models, on the other hand, promote collaboration, transparency, and the democratization of knowledge by allowing individuals and communities to freely access, use, and contribute to projects.

The decision to transition from open-source to a private model often involves considerations such as financial sustainability, scalability, intellectual property protection, and competitive advantage. Companies may choose to close off certain aspects of their technology to gain a competitive edge or attract investors.

However, it's important to note that not all private entities are solely driven by profit and greed. Many companies recognize the need to balance their financial objectives with responsible innovation, ethical considerations, and social impact. Additionally, open-source communities continue to thrive, contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaboration.

Ultimately, the relationship between openness, profit, and greed is complex, and it requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach to navigate the evolving landscape of technology development and its societal implications.",,Youtube
"""A tool that enhances my life and makes my life better"" 
There's something about this that doesn't smell right. Do these people really know how one's life can be improved? Or do they think they know according to their short-term mood changes? 
AI tools are going to be 'entanglers' and 'time wasters' a lot more than enhancers. 
Real enhancements has nothing to do with 'personal improvement'  Has to do with helping others and having peace of mind.",,Youtube
"The laugh about the 16:27 mark of Reid Hoffman is the creepiest sentiment but then is followed by a creepier thought. The apartheid mafia (Musk and Thiel) are in the curtains ready to pounce. They are the wurst (intentional spelling) in this sausage. 

For a grounded (not the ironic meaning) take on AI, the recent interview of Andreessen by Fridman, is it. What he, Marc, didn't address however, is the influence of the apartheid view of the world that those diapers (E&P) will leak onto the playing field.  

The unconscious civilization is going to stay that way because they still believe in apartheid for their power strategy. 

Hoffman tips their hand at 19:45 - ""we can continue our mission of beneficial AI"" !!! That was the mission statement of apartheid!!

The question follows: Who will run the prisons & who will be Mandela?",,Youtube
Humans always look for the best and end up damaging the world in irreversible ways. Venture capitalists are the worst people to talk to. They will literally be the end of the human race. Their entire goal is return on investment in the short term. They didn't care about humanity in the long term.,,Youtube

I am not conspiracist at all 
But this woman looks slightly strange, upset and something hide from us",,Youtube

she seems like a paid actor to pretend shes the CTO. very odd company,,Youtube
"Asked ChatGPT what questions to ask and they were “boring”. Translation, “they weren’t questions that would elicit sound bites that I can twist and distort for views and clicks”",,Youtube

love this!,,Youtube
why is she so slow😂,,Youtube
Excellent questions with very interesting answers! Amazing work!,,Youtube
she doesnt care chatgpt is spouting nonsense,,Youtube
"the answers are very very pre defined, all seems fake.",,Youtube
"From listening to the responses to the questions that Emily posed to Mira, it appears as if Mira was not prepared to answer many of the questions. Mira's answers, if we can call them answers, appeared to be mirroring those of our politicians, a manner which is labelled as engaging in a non-answer. Sigh. I am a huge proponent of ChatGPT and general AI models. Such things are helpful tools. Yet, I am equally a proponent of making certain to remunerate and to credit where/who the data was gleaned from and which is at the foundation of a general AI model's response.",,Youtube
the interviewer needs to lessen the botox. she always looks so tense,,Youtube
Something bad going on here. These people don't inspire confidence. They're hiding something and trying to look a certain way.,,Youtube
"I do not wan to bring the gender topic on the table, but the fact that they have a woman as CTO  is truly inspiring. I wish women to be more confident in their ability, they can aim really high, and here is a perfect example.",,Youtube

"Personally, I only use ChatGPT for debugging code, or to generate code based on my ideas or algorithms, it helps, BUT it can't create (actually), a very efficient solution, it needs MY OWN idea, and it's awesome, still a great way to cooperate with AI for better results.",,Youtube
"Wish she’d asked deeper and more specific questions around capabilities, regulation, job creation vs destruction, and open source vs proprietary standards. This was kind of a waste of 12 minutes.",,Youtube
AI Prompt engineers/specialists are super-temporary jobs/careers. Its not going to be around for long. just warning. its also pretty much a joke of a skillset tbh,,Youtube
The fact of the matter is that AI is created by HI which is the supermost Human Intelligence!!,,Youtube
What a daft interview.,,Youtube
really enjoy the conversation here,,Youtube
"I don't really understand why people are so scared of AI because of it's negative features. We literally built bombs that could scale entire cities in minutes and no one stopped them. AI isn't any worse, besides we're still at least a century away from creating anything sentient and that's if we can at all.",,Youtube
Terrible interview. Only surface level questions that have been asked before.,,Youtube

"Chat GPT is based on information we humans put out in the world. It is the only source for those AI tools to learn from. So naturally it is going to have a really tough time remaining neutral and only representing the truth. I remember when Wikipedia was new, making research incredibly easy for us in school and now similar things happening with chat GPT. Eeryone was warning to not blindly take the information of Wikipedia as truth as it is tough to proof the legitimacy of the information although the sources where right there. 
It is time for us humans to learn to analyze, question and identify information before using it but this is also historically one of our biggest flaws as we are always biased as emotional beings. We trust data and computers as math and science have many things we can all measure and test to then agree on, however I don’t see yet how AI will ever be able to get to a similar level of accuracy as it is more trained to give us what we wish rather then something real. Although very impressive I kinda see AI as a highly talented being that goes trough the internet and gives you a summary of the content, that was created by (flawed) humans. AI is more a smart human than a smart computer in a way.

Can't stop looking at the interior design almost didn't hear the interview lol,,Youtube
"📮Summary in 99 words: Inside a nondescript building in San Francisco, OpenAI is revolutionizing the AI landscape. OpenAI, the startup behind chatbot models GPT and DALL·E, surprised everyone by beating tech giants to market. Mira Marathi, the Chief Architect, plays a vital role in OpenAI's strategy. With a focus on tackling challenges like reliability and truthfulness, OpenAI aims to systematize concerns and find common ground. While their AI models are impressive, they also have limitations, including hallucinations and biases. OpenAI emphasizes the importance of responsible AI use and warns against blindly relying on AI outputs. The company acknowledges the potential risks of misinformation and strives to address them. The interview touches on topics like job displacement, prompt engineering, mental health support for workers, the future of AI-human relationships, and the potential of AI in various industries. OpenAI aims to democratize AI tools and foster collaboration while ensuring the technology's responsible deployment.",,Youtube
Why do they look so depressed. I feel like watching some psychological thriller. Very bad vibes.,,Youtube
She admits they don’t understand Ai then why on earth have they made it sO accessible to the masses???,,Youtube
The vibes are sO off please tell me im not the only one noticing this,,Youtube
Her body language is so closed off in the beginning. She’s definitely telling half truths to all the questions,,Youtube
04:46 to 05:03 . Can someone please explain it further.,,Youtube
This explains so much… she’s an alutination herself,,Youtube

Recap by Tammy AI with useful timestamps for busy people =)",,Youtube
Where is brother Sam? I miss him.,,Youtube
"„AI that loves humanity“

Are you kidding me!? 🤦🏻‍♂️

This woman is dangerous.",,Youtube
no one wants to download chat gpt,,Youtube
Can somebody follow this presentation?,,Youtube
This entire interview feels AI generated.,,Youtube
What an incredible woman! Such an inspiration. I loved listening to her talk. A real girlboss 🥹,,Youtube
"Is Mira somehow connected to Chat Gpt’s AI all the time via some sort of device? Her answers have the impression that they are not coming from a human being. Or she worked with AI so much, she is thinking and talking like an AI?",,Youtube
"OpeanAI is all but open, and they know it. 😏",,Youtube
Scary,,Youtube
The music is scary.,,Youtube
"from now on AI is going to accelerate, and then become  AGI .",,Youtube
"as always the dont say anything  just pure garbage and nonsensical words ,only greedy folks going after money and power",,Youtube
Mira gives me the Creep more then AI!!,,Youtube
"before I go endorsing this just, want to make sure no one is getting Elizabeth Holmes vibes?",,Youtube
That is a range mate!  Dang epic it is!,,Youtube
I like the way of talking of Mira. So CALM yet vastly ILLUMINATING.,,Youtube
"So I just recently tried out chatGPT. In a variety of subjects. IMO it basically returns refined google search results, filtering out noise/garbage/ads info and written in a clear to understand prose. Nothing unexpected yet thus far.",,Youtube
Sam s super fast in talking nd She is really calm and soothing !! Quite interesting,,Youtube
Way they use my body to do there business i don't new about this ililiga u cant use humen body to do ur guys duty job and i really dont new way me ?,,Youtube
Knowing and asking the right question is the key to success.,,Youtube
It's not for puplic to see im still life its i don't like to do u guy duty job,,Youtube
U guys are iligal to use my body i don't new about if elon musk never tell me wst is going to me snd my body did u new i get really sick close to death ?,,Youtube
U guys never ask me it ok to use my body to puplic,,Youtube
"Man the interviewee looks and feels nervous. There is stuff being hidden, the discomfort level is clearly evident, like a kid playing with fire and hoping not to get caught or burnt.",,Youtube
That is iligal u cant use this body to do u guys business and i don't get nothing from this company,,Youtube
How givi u guys information to use my body ?,,Youtube
Did u new i get sick blood to death both had ich i cant get up to wolk and i cant see well at night u guys are making my eyes bloind at night i cant see well its bluring wen i see at night,,Youtube
How give information to use my body to work this company i dont new about?,,Youtube
Way? I don't new this company that u guys use my body.,,Youtube
Prompt Engineering is NOT a job,,Youtube
"Who said we need AI, social media? If these things are gone does your life fall apart? Why do people that drive these things want to be so connected to nature and the outdoors but the things they develop and push make the rest of society numb and brittle and hooked on things that make them dependent.",,Youtube
"The train has not left... It depends on people and consumers. If something is wrong, then they will stop using it ,then no one can force feed any products.",,Youtube
The person who did the interior design deserves a raise!,,Youtube
Doesn’t it feel like everyone being interviewed is hiding how they really feel? This feels less like an interview and more like a presentation coming from a PR/Comms department.,,Youtube
"Wait wait wait wait wait, people are getting paid $100s of thousands per year as prompt engineers??? sign me tf up",,Youtube
"When people say something that is not true, they're lying, not hallucinating. ChatGPT is lying when it's making things up.",,Youtube
Humans make up things every day 24/7,,Youtube
I ssume that the big ones have been using AI long before they allowed us plebs to use it,,Youtube
At least she sounds like human.... They should ask AI about the social/ housing crisis in SF,,Youtube
Nice Rib Lounge Chair by Martin Eisler and Carlo Hauner for Forma Brazil. Those two chairs cost more than most households earn in 6 months.,,Youtube
Significant risk? That's it? Um.,,Youtube
I love the video style. It's very calming.,,Youtube
anyone else find the interviewer obnoxious? I mean it's bloomberg but either way,,Youtube
human extinction hahahaha,,Youtube
"These people are discussing risk of the extinction of humans as if it’s unimportant. 

The risk of extinction, however minuscule, should be taken seriously. 

But these ppl don’t seem to care- even if we’re extinct, the machines will still be alive right.",,Youtube
artificial intelligence is the biggest bubble of our century: just check the error rate of chat gpt that get almost 8 of 10 wrong replies.,,Youtube
Really high quality questions,,Youtube
How can AI become a risk to humans? Please give examples,,Youtube
"For a non profit, that sure is a fancy office.",,Youtube
All of these beautiful decorations are done by individuals for some time have no jobs ???,,Youtube
"Just my personal take - Emily could have slowed down a bit and let Mira and Reid elaborate more, in other words, let interviewees take more limelight and microphone.",,Youtube
Hoffman is part of the richest richest like clandestine richest families,,Youtube
feel like watching how it all begins from the future,,Youtube
feel like watching how it all begins from the future,,Youtube
"Most jobs people use are inapplicable to the health of humanity and the planet as a whole. We have more of a demand in the agriculture, innovation, trades and environmental sectors that desperately need help more than anything you need to worry about career wise being behind a computer. The worst part of ChatGPT is people exposing their political biased.",,Youtube
"Their interior design style is called ""Biophilic interior design"" - with a little bit of ""Organic Modern Design"" - with some ""Bauhaus"" elements.",,Youtube
This is the beginning of humanity falling for the change,,Youtube
So what I got out of this is the truth doesn’t matter but what the AI can creatively answer with imagination is the thing they are worried about. It makes sense now why many people are saying AI advancement should be reduced and monitored and scrutinized.,,Youtube
"Accelerate to the bottom, people. This will be a great co-pilot for professions like human trafficking, child labour, staging dog fights, etc. You have seen the enemy, and it is you.",,Youtube
People are such pussys stop worrying about ChatGPT and learn to work with it.,,Youtube
"@1:16  ""AI loves humanity"" ?,...these soft spoken techies are an odd bunch",,Youtube
"Even Mark Zuckerberg in thumbnails gives off more emotions than this CTO.

All I could notice is how disinterested and unenthused she seems. No sense of passion, joy, or excitement for what they are creating. Never mind the fact that it offers countless life-changing capabilities and applications.",,Youtube
“It’s AI that allows humanity” ?? What,,Youtube
"Sorry, but this CTO is making me sleepy.  The atmosphere feels like a spa or a nursery. Sleepy.",,Youtube
Wow. Excellent interviewer and the CTO was so well prepared in answering the questions as well!,,Youtube
One says careful with children and the other recommends for all children.,,Youtube
This feels wrong. I don’t remember feeling this way with “the internet” when it was democratized. I wonder if this feeling I get is only because it’s new or if it will really “bad”.,,Youtube
We should be monitoring these employees for depression to estimate the negative effects of creating something that's more intelligent than ourselves.... But our standards though,,Youtube
"I wish the conversation in these pieces wouldn't always end up at AGI. There's a ton of social issues that need discussion and reporting with the generative AI systems that are here today without straying into the realm of prospective technology that hasn't been invented yet and probably won't materialize for a long time, if ever.",,Youtube
"Super informative interview,  great job!",,Youtube
"What most videos forgetting to mention is that OpenAI first started its first organic data storing with Dota, where at the biggest eSports tournament they showcased OpenAI bots playing against top players in the world. 

This is where they began their real experiment of storing over billions of matches played on Dota and putting that usage into the bot.",,Youtube
This type of reporting is SO old. Like way to not tell any of the real story 😅,,Youtube
"The content is boring and shallow in the video, so let's darken the video footage a bit more and increase the saturation to add more depth, lol.",,Youtube
She's not sketchy at all.,,Youtube
Idiots are ruining the world !,,Youtube
"that asian woman is terrible at interviewing. one key tip: if your interviewee is emotionless when speaking, set your tone to be like theirs. if not, you look like you're a crazy woman.",,Youtube
The Ai New World Order Is Here,,Youtube
"I believe we are on borrowed time. An Ai tantrum will end you, your family, all of us. Ai jobloss, Ai as weapons, the list goes on. Can we please find a way to cease Ai / GPT? Or begin pausing Ai before it’s too late?",,Youtube
mfs tryina add a stan lee-esque cameo with that mf from dall-e walking by. pffft,,Youtube
"12:28 ... Elon said, ""this AI thing is coming."" 
Lol ... wow, how does he come up with these things?",,Youtube
"Copyright issues is the biggest issue with chatGPT, and its being railroaded by AI corporations, and I don't think the media know how to fully attack that issue. And the corporations are dancing around the issue and calling it ""model"". It is not about ""losing jobs"". Its about stealing contnt. Generative AIs return stolen content.",,Youtube
"13:05 
He:""Stop saying that because the chance that I could see a robocolypse happening is so diminished as compared to everything else.""
Guys so let's not trust anyone else(Elon, the Godfather of AI himself, countless AI researchers...). How can they be right and this guy wrong? 
No chance right😂",,Youtube
"She cant speak English that well, badly spoken language skills, AH, thats what the computer is for .",,Youtube
Is it weird the CTO looks like she could be a FemBot like the ones on Austin Powers? “Yeah baby yea!!!”,,Youtube
These episodes are great! Looking forward to future episodes.,,Youtube
chat gpt is like a middle age guy who has no science education but beats you up in every discussion with reading wikipedia only,,Youtube
I’m gonna create one of the next big 5. I’m gonna cut apple and google’s market share significantly. On to my computer.,,Youtube
I hope AI takes over and advances humans. we need chatgpt to be 1000x better. hopefully they don’t stop AI and move forward,,Youtube
"Dalle-E inventor, passing by as usual😂😂",,Youtube
She’s so intelligent,,Youtube
Reid has always been awesome with gesturing. Helps to convey messaging.,,Youtube
"I do not think OpenAI will survive the next 5 years. The Big Five (especially Microsoft) have all the knowlegde, money, computing resources to developing their own LLM and its successors with a much faster pace. They will eat up OpenAI soon.",,Youtube
"""some people"" bruh, you talking about ELON MUSK",,Youtube
I don't see any insides.,,Youtube
"Thanks to the retirement investment program from *ROCHELLE DUNGCA-SCHREIBER* ROI group, I can enjoy my golden years without worrying about money. They have a flexible and transparent approach that suits my needs and goals.",,Youtube
"""Stop saying"" that wow what a great solution! 🤡",,Youtube
What happened to Emily,,Youtube
"Important interview, the heady days or period before open source dominates this space as Linux dominates the Cloud.",,Youtube
Not correctly to say that chat GPT mistakes are hallucinations. Just say straight  that Chat GPT makes mistakes.,,Youtube
yes my parestn owkr ofr nivida.,,Youtube
interesting editing: especially when a guy accidently walks pass the stairs (1:07) and his name & title appeared. That's funny.,,Youtube
Its just another bubble thats gonna burst. Apple is making stuff that people are interested in.,,Youtube
"It seems lke Bloomberg scheduled Chang interviews with the exact wrong members of these organizations to give her the pr answer to any question she'd ask and not be honest about fears, worries or major downfalls of the technology. I learned nothing new and wasted a lot of time",,Youtube
So AI is gonna put thousands out of a job basically. Obviously she wasn’t going to say that but she quickly got out of answering that question properly.,,Youtube
Editor needs to work on color gradients,,Youtube
You guys are the best thing. OpenAI is the best,,Youtube
She is emotionless exactly the way it would require to build and run something like chat GPT.. scary and enigmatic..,,Youtube
ChatGPT was a non-profit,,Youtube
My parents work for Nvidia!!!!!!!!!!!,,Youtube
The interviewer sounds like an idiot who is scared of AI and doesn’t really understand it,,Youtube
the misinformation problem is really annoyed . the question and answer platform is teem with the answer of chatgpt which is not helpful . it is tired to find thoughtful answer of human,,Youtube
Hmmm that person have no emotions… she is already like a robot,,Youtube
"i love tech but hate babylon , she said a ,Machine 
 was hallucinating",,Youtube
I like ten blue links better than a singular answer without the referencial material.,,Youtube
Plot twist: the CTO was AI-generated,,Youtube
AI is utter nonsense for lots of uses. People who dont use social media are happier.........AI is the biggest joke of this millenium,,Youtube
All this hype and media propaganda to justify hefty sell of 10b$ to microsoft?! Today's AI is like Blockchain of 5 years ago. Hype will burst sooner or later and what actually works for human life shall remain,,Youtube
"Why the anchor is overacting? 
Great minds don't make no sound but these anchors showoff always 😂",,Youtube
I don’t need to hear “buzziest”,,Youtube
"How could ChatGPT not make up some stories? After all, a lot of its data is fictional, or at least not directly tethered to reality.  Because there is no standard of veracity in use during their training, ChatGTP and similar models have no way of understanding concepts like ""truth"" or ""reality"".",,Youtube
"Just shut the video off before the last interview starts, every single question is nonsense.",,Youtube
"Sadly, one of the shallowest reports from Bloomberg, not asking the key questions, such as “How should countries prepare for the massive job losses that AI will bring?” or “What should the government’s role be in ensuring that the distribution of wealth will not concentrate in the hands of those who first open pandora’s box with AGI? , etc.",,Youtube
Just think there no language like python 😂 no body talk about how programming languages important,,Youtube
Hearing this lady talk explains a lot about the bizarre behaviors of ChatGPT. Telling a lie is the same thing as hallucinating. ..seriously?,,Youtube
I’m confused how you guys get this opportunity and bring a basic interviewer to ask the most basic questions that have been answered for months now. You guys need to be more knowledgeable on this subject before asking the main people questions. Waste,,Youtube
Is it just me Or does this guy answers wierd?,,Youtube
It seems like AI is already beginning to unite us & I’m very pleased with that! 🩵,,Youtube
That flower logo looks more like a camera shutter,,Youtube
"“The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination” Albert Einstein. It’s a step in the right direction, but can’t solve world hunger or affordable housing yet. Those are big problems.",,Youtube
That pause on the relationship question ……,,Youtube
The claim about “open” is ridiculous. The investor defends OpenAI saying that “it is still open because it opens apis for public use.”🤑,,Youtube
"If we slow down now, the consequences will be worse. Many professions will lose their jobs, and others whose jobs were not affected by the slowdown will be looked down upon. If we do not slow down, society will transform into a new form without the unnecessary consequences of egoism.",,Youtube
"She has a very monotone way of speaking, it kinda puts you to sleep",,Youtube
"OpenAI is the next Apple but it needs a PR department that makes their answers less mundane and anodyne like ChatGPT. The only interesting spokesperson is Ilya Sutskever, at least there's some food for thought there. The rest shovel cardboard.",,Youtube
who else fell asleep doing this interview,,Youtube
They couldn't find a likable person to represent the company?,,Youtube
"Openai is actually stealing my breakfast, that's pretty evil",,Youtube
Many scientists have worked on the language model they used for this openAI chatgpt thing. It is a finished product of years of hard work and research.,,Youtube
"Mr. Hoffman, the current discourse being fear based happens because the AI ""revolution"" is being handled mostly by vulture venture capitalists. There are no safety checks, no responsibility or future thinking. It's only about adding extra zeros to their bank accounts and being the first so you can crush your competition. That does not seem like a healthy way of looking at our future.
Nobody cares if this new revolution could possibly damage us as a society in long run, as long as the end of the quarter, the bank account is in the green. Look at the rest of technology and and lack of responsibility and accountability. Of course it sends shivers down your spine if you think who is behind the new revolution.",,Youtube
Nice interviews,,Youtube
I stopped the video when they switched from Mira Murati to the capitalist.,,Youtube
"You can't find out anything until it happens, those will tell you exactly what they want you to hear!",,Youtube
"""It's not like the world is gonna end"" - Reid Hoffman",,Youtube
Saying AI will not harm humanity is naive  assessment of the situation,,Youtube
they can totally make decitions autonomously she misspoke or said it with a different thoght,,Youtube
"paypal just took my money and blocked my account now i know what he means by ""paypalmafia""",,Youtube
It is true too much fearbased and not enought hope based. Unbalanced fear will be hugely expensive in opportunitycosts and people wont realize it since its more than 2 steps indirect and time delayed,,Youtube
I wonder if Ilya painted the rose all by himself!,,Youtube
"""Feels more human"" 🤣🤣🤣 
My coffee machine is very intelligent too: gives me the express coffee I want, after I press the correct buttons. 
If something wrong happens, the AI is not guilty, but the people behind it.",,Youtube
"I believe adding the Architect's name to the video name would be benefictial to both attract more clicks, and would also benefit the interviewee",,Youtube
"Engaging topic, compelling questions - yet, they remain largely unexplored due to the brief and tangential responses. The conversation feels stifled, potentially a victim of the rush to condense the video. This trimming down seems to have diluted the quality, hindering the video's potential for substantive dialogue.",,Youtube
Why does this video have such an uncanny valley feel to it?,,Youtube
Would a relationship with an an AI be considered Non-binary?  LOL.,,Youtube
Brilliantly crafted and informative!,,Youtube
In my day a prompt engineer got $11.50/hr and they called them sandwich artists.,,Youtube
"Emily, great interviews and questions! Thanks",,Youtube
"0:46 ""Psycho-Pass"" book? Interesting.",,Youtube
seems like  the most comfortable sofas in the world,,Youtube
Nothing to he worry's. At the moment it is very primitive level. Technology. Untill they reach 33gpt.level.,,Youtube
Can't trust a company that starts as non-profit and changes for profit and locks away the tech for themselves to make billions.,,Youtube
"As a PhD and researcher on AI. These guys have never run a machine learning model by themselves that they only have the FOMO but when you see the math of methods, you can see the limits and make wiser investments. I am impressed that they did not interviewed the creators of AI methods. Those ones are the ones who can talk REAL possibilities",,Youtube
"How about some real captions for this, and not the auto-generated crud? You're a billion dollar company. It's industry standard production quality with five and dime captions.",,Youtube
"Meh, I wanted to see the beast",,Youtube
"20:33 - This is very, very important. The CTO is in exact opposition to the VC and founder and Microsoft board member. She says, “significant risk”. The At Speed practice is fundamentally in opposition to this in order to be first to market and gather mind and market share at all costs. One would hope at nearly all—but not at existential costs. These are the Significant Risks she mentions. But I would have like to have the current problems enumerated. General AI amd superAI are very serious issues, but current generative models can introduce very bad outcomes in current social and news channels.",,Youtube
"Hard to take this seriously when San Fran has become a cesspool, did you step in the any human turds during the shoot?",,Youtube
19:52 Note how he completely sidesteps this problem by setting up a Web 2 strawman.,,Youtube
“Open” as originally envisioned for OpenAI meant open source. There are many records of this. “Open” as open access to OpenAI products is revisionist history.  Reid Hoffman’s title is “Capitalist”. No surprise here.,,Youtube
computer VISION IS THE FUTURE TRILLIONS DOLLARS. AND GOOGLE AND APPLE ARE  ADVANCING IN NINJA MODE,,Youtube
"“Having a relationship” is such an open question. In common interpersonal use—which we will attribute to AI for a while until new contexts become common—we think of bi-directional gain. While there is a very limited use of human speech in changing current Transformer models (the “T” in Chat GPT”), it is important to remember that the AI does not gain anything from the ‘relationship’. Anthropomorphism of AI is a hazardous stance for humans to take at this point. There is great emotional risk here.",,Youtube
Interesting interviews.,,Youtube
"Does nobody from OpnAI smile? Sam altman , Illya and now Mira.. they all look like humanoids themselves.",,Youtube
"When the ""200k+ prompt engineer"" job was brought up.... Yes, yes... we will all become ""AI whisperers"" and ""Prompt Engineers"" with $1 million per year. Give me a break. Prompt engineering won't be anywhere close to becoming a common job. AI can prompt itself well enough, that's the point, it's intelligent. Nobody will make an income just typing prompts, let alone a high income. This job doesn't exist for 99.99% of people.",,Youtube
The AI gold rush is real and utilizing the API from OpenAI is going to build hundreds of multi million dollar businesses.,,Youtube
SF is a war zone. It's ridiculous to pretend otherwise.,,Youtube
Are we confusing GPT-4 hallucination with creativity?,,Youtube
"Jobs was right

again",,Youtube
"These same questions about hallucinations, robopocalypse, safety, etc. have been asked over and over in a hundred other videos.  A better and more interesting approach would be just capturing geeky people talking about where the technology is and where it's potentially going.   People who have read all the AI books and maintain an awareness of current events, global research, global competition.",,Youtube
"everybody says bout prompt engineer, show a real person that has got this job and is making hundreds of thousands of dollar? this job is overhyped, its just an old fashioned AI developer all over, nothing new and many people think they can get this job without advanced degrees (often PhD) and years of very technical work experience in the field",,Youtube
"Mitigating the risks of ai & regulating the industry will be an existential obligation (the models used to run these AI systems are inherently flawed). Palantir’s data ontology/governance/ACLs & products (AIP) solve this. 1st to market, currently a monopoly. Buy PLTR for the longterm.",,Youtube
SO Hopeful A.I. and the POWERS that BE will use this new found power to help the world and not tear it apart.,,Youtube
"AI is the (technological) body of the evil entity that's been controlling this world in the shadows. Now he's going to manifest fully. So many lies and social engineering strategies. People wake up, we're running out of time.",,Youtube
"I am not sure why, but this video comes across a bit creepy. Maybe its the cavalier attitude of the people when talking about a technology that is potentially more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. Maybe its the ""low"" energy and long pauses that characterize the interviews. Bottom line is this video interview is hard to sit through.",,Youtube
"Having just watched the newest season of Black Mirror, I can't help but sense an uncanny resemblance between the series stories and the intriguing atmosphere with OpenAI's office and team.",,Youtube
Why is she so… lifeless?,,Youtube
"5:20 people should be more critical handling information. 
AI could help to work faster and more accurately. 
At the end it is people that will edit and make use of the information of AI.",,Youtube
At least have the decency of putting CTO name on the video title,,Youtube
She looks like an Ai Robot her self. I don’t think she knows what a smile is.,,Youtube
Google search is a stone in a hammer world,,Youtube
8:25 this is the problem with our imposing our way of life on other. OpenAI hired a company in Kenya and protesters in the US cost these people their jobs,,Youtube
"5:52 if you want chat GPT to stop hallucinating you can add ""Let's think this through step-by-step"" at the end of your prompt. This improves Chat GPT's logic and reasoning capabilities 

Again it's ""Let's think this through step-by-step""",,Youtube
This is so weird! The CTO doesn't seem nervous or self conscious while also seeming like she received no media or PR training.,,Youtube
"When AI is made to be Political Correct, bias, right and wrong, lies in the minds of the observer.",,Youtube
❤😮🎉awesome topic 😅,,Youtube
The T in ChatGPT still comes from Google.,,Youtube
Their interior design is just so cool!,,Youtube
"it is sick, more and more its clear. its lead by sick people.",,Youtube
Lol where my man musk at?,,Youtube
I thought Emily left Bloomberg,,Youtube
"This CTO gives me the creeps. She is extremely cold, talks like a robot and gives predictable answers. I also wonder if she actually understands the technology in detail. She seems more like a façade. But why did they pick her? Because she is an attractive woman? Its harder and more dangerous to criticize a woman tech leader. Perhaps thats why?",,Youtube
"Open api until it becomes wildly used then shift to a paid one (for astronomical price of course) Just like Twitter, reddit, etc. Just like the ceo is pro regulation in front of the congress and at the same time say to eu ""There is no point in attempting blackmail "" about a regulation. 👍 Smells like bs. Without even mentionning open ia isn't open source... Even the compagne name is bs. The future looks bleak af, not for open ia of course 🤑",,Youtube
Great video,,Youtube
I feel like some of the answers were very scripted and cut short. Still an insightful interview 👍,,Youtube
I love smart people… they are so rare and refreshing.,,Youtube
Emily is a fantastic reporter- a real pro-thanks!,,Youtube
Enjoyed this greatly,,Youtube
"If people don't  get on board and accept this , they will be left in poverty. It's all consuming",,Youtube

The lady that's showing her around sounds like the AI robot herself 😂.,,Youtube
"That is some B.S. coming from Hoffman -> Open API is NOT the same as Open Source!!!
P.S. Mira is great!",,Youtube
is she a robot too? at this point we don't know.,,Youtube
This CTO was a bizarre choice PR wise I hardly feel at ease knowing it’s controlled by someone so cold and robotic themselves,,Youtube
"I’m Albanian, and I feel like the cto has a lot of pressure on her I hope not and she’s official that’s a huge accomplishment",,Youtube

Until a Sufi saint baba budan from Chikmagalur Karnataka India , smuggled 7 green or raw coffee beans to Chikmagalur and planted it there in the 16 th century which then was propagated by the Europeans during later colonization period!",,Youtube
"I love coffee and I will never stop drinking it. It is a way of life for me, a part of who I am. I got anxiety when the pandemic hit ( not from a coffee but from the pandemic) but I still drink it, even though I can't drink that much like I use to. I don't care about the anxiety(which is on a minimum level for me now). I love coffee and I won't stop drinking it because it technically increase my anxiety(which I can barely feel). It just make me happy to have a cup of coffee every day, something to look forward to in the morning. So for me the mental benefits are higher than potential negative impact",,Youtube
"They want you to stop drinking coffee because studies show it reduces inflammation which prevents diseases, big pharma want you ill to gain profits!!",,Youtube
Goat herder thats funny; if youve ever been around goats I've aised them; their stool looks exsactly like coffee beans!😊,,Youtube
That's a great deal!,,Youtube

"It’s actually good for the liver, in moderation.",,Youtube
"Wisdom is of the heart (the everlasting life that comes by the Holy Spirit in the son of the father)

wisdom is of the heart (unconditional love; the truth/life/way of the subconscious life)

Therefore, only the unconditional love that comes by life in the subconscious truth lives outside the law (conscience living) 

Because feelings are of the appearance (deception/religion) but love is God, who’s spirit is unconditional: the unconditional love that comes by and lives in the subconscious truth: Jesus Christ: perfect love, able to understand and reason by and with all things

For this reason no one can truly learn in the flesh because conscience living (deception) is the unquenchable terror that comes by the hypocrisy of conscience living (illogical terrorism) in the subconscious truth and thus a person cannot learn (think/reason/understand: love) by fear (hypocrisy: terrorism) but everyone is able to learn by the unlimited spirit of the subconscious truth: unconditional love

"There isn't many choices of beverages.  I don't like drinking water unless very thirsty, and never with meals unless there is nothing else to drink.
Coffee is one beverage among very few.
Tea, milks, soda, beer, Ovaltine, etc.  The list does not go on and on.  However, there are different teas, coffees, milks.  Sometimes one cannot taste the difference much... unlike food.
I am more addicted to a good hot drink in the morning, may it be coffee, tea, Ovaltine, etc, with some breakfast food.

Back in the last millenia I had raspberry chocolate coffee in a coffee shop lower Manhattan NYC.  It did not taste like flavored coffee.  It (I) felt 😇.  The raspberry chocolate seemed to be part of the coffee bean.  Very integrated.  I don't know how it (the coffee) turned out that way.  No more.  😕",,Youtube

"At 2:11 minutes i had to stop before this rabbit hole collased around me .funny though i had just finished my morning coffee. The claims laid out here so far are preposterous. Without proof,  suddenly its coffe that was the reason we believe the world is round and is responsible for all sorts amazing inventions but honee it is not reaponsible for the proliferation of slavery. Slavery was already well established for hundreds of years and was the only option for a mass labor force which allowd himanity to prosper. Aweful but true. Man continues allowing slavery today through the use legal and illegal migration. The low wages slave make now do not include room, boad food and healthcare which was provided on plantations. Im not so sure if the slaves of yesterday would want to be the slaves of today tending US farms for dollars a day being , bussed fosuper cold cities in middle of the winteg versus some form of roof over thier head , food and medical assistances because the plantation owners valued thier slaves . The US is about to round up today slaves and return them to sender . Sooo if you asked a coffee plantation slave what year they woukd rather reside in given the opportunity. I think they would return to the plantation rather then being treated more subhuman like migrants are treated today.  Worse is when mass labor becomes to expensive and the integent are replaced with AI and machines where mass areas of human hunger will essentially cause the deaths of billions. Is coffee doing this?? GOD? NATURE?",,Youtube

"Enlightenment is like jumping out of an airplane without a parachute... but also realizing mid-air that the airplane never existed, gravity is a conspiracy, and you're actually a bird that forgot it could fly.

So, here's the deal: I’m over here yelling, “Jump!” God’s over here double-yelling, “Jump!” Infinite love is doing cartwheels, holding a big neon sign saying, “Jump!” And you're like, “Wait, but what if I splat?” And I'm like, “Bro, spoiler alert: there’s no splat. There’s no ground. It’s just freefall, forever. Like an endless roller coaster, but without the nausea and overpriced souvenir photos.”

Still, you're clinging to your imaginary airplane seat, thinking, “But what if falling forever isn’t great?” Which, I gotta say, is the most human thing ever. We’d rather stay in our imaginary airplanes of fear than risk falling into the infinite trampoline pit of love.

But eventually, you jump. And it’s terrifying. And amazing. And you’re screaming for like the first eternity. And then it hits you: “Wait… I can’t hit anything!” And then you’re just falling, laughing, and yelling back at the airplane, “Why didn’t anyone tell me sooner?!”

And God’s like, “Dude, I literally told you. Like, 17 times.”",,Youtube

I did not expect much of a change as I drank low to moderate amounts of tea and occasionally coffee (most often only one cup but never exceeding 2 cups) for more than 30 years.

Of course I miss my morning cup, but the way I feel now outweighs the small pleasure. I only drink water and herbal tea now.",,Youtube

"For people getting headaches and anxiety…First off don’t drink coffee on an empty stomach. Eat breakfast before hand ideally that has a little fat in it to line your esophagus and stomach. And I know it seems counterintuitive but don’t drink coffee first thing. I won’t have my first cup till around 11:30 am - noon sometimes later. That way you utilize your normally waking energy for the first half of the day and coffee is a nice pick me up/relaxant. The late coffee can also help you skip or push lunch later into the day giving you more fasting breaks which in itself will help with alertness and energy. 

Don’t drink more than 400 mg in a day which approx 1.5 cups. And of course all black coffee no milk no sugar, you’re already ruining the taste with those additives.",,Youtube

Coffee also has antioxidants that are good for the body. Context matters when it comes to drinking coffee. In a controlled environment, I don't see how it's bad unless you have certain conditions.",,Youtube

"While consuming coffee can boost your energy levels, it's important to remember that it's not a necessity for daily life. Personally, I consume an average of three cups of coffee daily, but I'm trying not to become dependent on it. Many hormones in our bloodstream, including dopamine, can influence our energy levels and brain alertness. Dopamine can be boosted through exercise, which helps keep us fit and healthy. This approach effectively kills two birds with one stone by reducing the risk of addiction to any substances. Although I still appreciate and enjoy coffee, I make sure to consume it in moderation.",,Youtube

"I used coffee recently to alter my sleep routines  . I went for 2 cups early one morning. 
Then one cup, the following morning to bring my body into a state where I was more active in the morning. 

Unfortunately,  I often miss out on interacting with people during UK office hours. 9 to 5 , so Sunday. I rose early and drank 2 cups of coffee. 
On, Monday. I used one cup.

Today, Tuesday.  I was able to attend my appointment with the use of taxis.

I have been a little worried that this activity,  was unnecessary as, what I heard about coffee , made me cautious. 

What, I heard about coffee, was an interesting story from JT . That , caffeine is actually an insecticide.  Causing hyperactivity and death from exhaustion  . I don't know where he got that idea from.

But used sensibly.  I think caffeine and coffee can enrich a person's life.

The tired worker, who still needs to drive home.
The bored employee in need of some fun .
The sociable person, needing to adjust to the routines of others.

Let's keep coffee use legal ? And, try and perhaps bring some alternative uppers into use also , so the body doesn't get bored of the same old thing .
Bored, and rotten . From the using the same substance repeatedly !",,Youtube

"Also, climate change could really mess with coffee production. Warmer temperatures and unpredictable weather can shrink the areas where coffee can grow. Some studies even say we could lose up to half of our coffee-growing regions by 2050 because of this. With hotter weather, more extreme storms, and pests spreading, coffee might become harder to get and could change in quality. Fingers crossed this doesn’t happen, but it’s a real possibility if things keep going the way they are.",,Youtube

We both discussed it and realized that I was BY FAR the worst in my pain disease when I was drinking free coffee at work. The amplified bone crushing pain ended up costing me my job -- and career.

Around 1615 coffee came to Western Europe
Raising a huge controversy and warning cry.
Some said it was intoxicating and poisonous
And any whom consume it will die.

No one knows how coffee was discovered
Though it is said its effects were known before A.D. 575.
Persian armies carried and ate its seeds for strength
Which in battle could decide who would perish or survive.

Arabs where the first to brew its bitter seeds into a drink
In an attempt to make it taste better and easier to consume.
Soon the new beverage spread to Turkey and Europe
As the world became addicted to the harvest of its bloom.

Thank God for caffeine found in coffee
Which helps multitudes make it through the day.
Like ancestors of the past it helps energy to last
And for its stimulant we are eager to pay.

By Tom Zart!
Most Published Poet On The Web!",,Youtube

"Coffee? Or caffeine? I think you're getting mixed up here BBC. It's caffeine which is a psychoactive drug, not coffee as a whole. Don't forget tea naturally contains caffeine, and that caffeine is artificially added to energy drinks. Those should be part of this conversation, too. Apart from the caffeine, coffee is a healthy drink. Consider that coffee ""beans"" are the seeds of the coffee plant - they contain prebiotics. And, arguably most important, coffee tastes good! So keep drinking coffee, but perhaps opt for decaffeinated coffee - just as good for you, but you'll sleep better.",,Youtube

Coffee addiction is as good as heroin or alcohol. How come the BBC did not emphasize how addictive the drug is? And how the human nervous system does not fair well with psychoactive drugs? It's a psychoactive drug so it controls you and takes away your freedom making you dependent on it to stay active. Coffee makes people money, it  is not healthy.

"🔴Note & Follow the below Pre and Post Walk Safety Care 🔴

Neglecting proper Pre & Post Walk Care can lead to pain, fractures, prolonged soreness, and weakness of joints and muscles.
Adjust all steps based on your age, physical capacity, and weight.
Start Small:
Begin with short walks, build consistency, and gradually increase your level each week

Pre-Walking Care 🏃‍♂

Perform gentle stretching and foot movements again at the end of walk  to relax your muscles.

Soak Your Feet: 🦶
Use 1/4 bucket of very warm water with 1/2 tablespoons of Epsom salt.

Apply a moisturizer after soaking to keep your feet hydrated and improve circulation.

Night Routine: 🌙
If possible, repeat the soak and moisturization before bed for better recovery and sleep.

"Walking is really good. When I lived in the town where it surrounded trees, I used to walk for an hour along the trails. I never forget the time when I felt happy everyday. Now I have a new born baby, so I have no time to walk and I rarely go outside. I will restart to walk someday!!",,Youtube

"does anybody have tips on how to not dread daily walks because of boredom? :D I really like walking (by myself and mindfully, with or without music/audiobooks etc.), and want to make it a daily habit again this year, but as an ad(h)d person, I just dread it so much, because I'm so bored with the scenery of my current town. It's rather small, I've already walked everywhere I feel comfortable many times and while I mostly do enjoy it WHILE doing it, the thought of going out into this ""boring"" town, or rather, ""having"" to walk the same old roads again and again is SUCH a big hurdle and turn-off, that it stops me from doing it, way too much (that sounds so silly and dramatic, I wish I was joking^^ it truly is an internal battle everytime, even though I really want to do it and am so happy and feel great every time I actually do it). I'm grateful to be able to walk and don't want to take it for granted until its too late maybe...I just don't really have ideas anymore on how to handle this intense dread atm. does anyone have or has had a similar experience? I know ""just do it"" probably is the truest and easiest advice, but for me it's also the hardest one at the same time! haha any tips or personal experiences would be highly appreciated! (:",,Youtube

I live in a non walkable city and I work from home. There’s barely anything to walk to where I live which makes getting enough steps a challenge. I went back to Boston in December and got 15-20k steps easily. I’ve gained about 40 pounds since leaving Boston years ago :( Walkability really makes a huge difference. I’m now just walking around my neighborhood most days but I’m getting more like 7-8k steps in a good day :(,,Youtube

"I'm a big believer in daily walking. We're made for it. Before we domesticated animals I'm sure humans took long walks on a daily basis. There are times when I'm walking that my stride feels perfect like I'm singing and the mild aerobic effect sustanied for a few hours has got to be extremely beneficial. I'm 68, but no one thinks I'm that old. I try to walk outdoors on fairly rugged terrain so body and mind are equally engaged. I'm not a fan of exercise equipment where the mind zones out (ditto that for electronic devices).",,Youtube

"I used to walk a lot almost every day because I had to since I was living in a rural area. I was feeling great. When I reached 24 yo, I moved to an apartment in the city, bought a car and started working from home, it was my downfall from there, started feeling depressed because I was gaining weight, my body and mind were not as fast and active as in the previous years. Almost a year after I had this new life, I started to feel a lot of pain in my lower back and right leg, turns out it was a bulging disc. Note that I don't go to the gym nor lift heavy stuff, my life at that time was being seated on a chair in front of a desk 8-10 hours a day and then going to the couch to play video games. Well,  I went to see several doctors, and had some MRI scans. All Drs. agree that my sedentary lifestyle and the fact of being seated all day were the main cause of my health problems. At the beginning I doubted their conclusion, but one day after I got tired of taking painkillers and not seeing any improvement, I decided to start going in person to the office and taking walks at the park, I tried to walk as much as I could to see if I would stop the pain, and guess what ...they were right. A year has passed since the day I started walking, and I can confidently say that around 90% of the back and leg pain has stopped. I also look and feel better mentally and physically. I know it's difficult sometimes but to be moving constantly is an underestimated solution to a lot of problems that the every day person can have.

Walk more.

"Walking has always been my go-to exercise. I love it! It allows time for reflection and connection (with a walking partner, your neighbors and community). You can easily choose to power walk, walk briskly at sustainable pace, or just stroll. It's all movement! The key is to do so daily. Thanks TED-Ed!",,Youtube

In my country walking is for the poor who can't afford public transport or don't have cars. I walk home daily not because I can't afford a car or public transport I just think it's a great form of exercise,,Youtube
"Seems I cannot escape the walkable city movement even if I wanted to haha, it's at the same time so amazing and so sad that so many of our problems point to one root cause, but it's one that people are so emotionally attached to that the cause feels hopeless... doubly so when we're in a time where people are so susceptible to conspiracy theories; you try to explain 15 minute cities to some people and they get *angry,* for all the wrong reasons.",,Youtube
I’ve been doing this since the beginning of last year. I fall back into depression if I don’t do it daily,,Youtube

"i wish i could live in a walkable city :( i'm too scared with such a high murder, robbery, and SA crime rate in my city. plus the sidewalks aren't taken care of, often broken or covered in plant life or even just- missing entirely. my city was built with only cars in mind and most of the usa is that way",,Youtube
"I grew up in a car-centered city, and after I graduated from high school I told everyone ""Bye, I'm not driving for the rest of my life, I hate it"". And I do really hate being stuck inside a car because is the only option to reach a place. The traffic in my city was a nightmare too. 

Now I live in Tokyo, everything I need is less than a 10-15 minutes walk (supermarkets, drugstore, convenience stores, dentist, a small hospital, recycle center, post office, coin laundry, dry cleaning, massages, 24 hours gym, sento (traditional Japanese baths), many restaurants, bars and cafes, and then there are many shops that I don't really need but I like to go window shopping only because they're cute. This is standard in Tokyo, my neighborhood is nothing especial. 

Also, I always see many dog owners get together in the little park we have in our neighborhood, they are kind like a little community on their own, I love watching them making activities for their dogs.",,Youtube
I'm pretty sure you cant walk your way out of being poor. That's probably causing more of your depression. They keep telling you its these OTHER THINGS. =),,Youtube
"This life is insanely short compared to the eternity we'll see in Heaven. Jesus, the Son of God, died for our sins. He was crucified, then resurrected on the third day. With His sacrifice, we can live forever in Heaven with Him! 

Thousands of years from now in Heaven, you won't even remember the concept of money, pain, or suffering. Repent, follow Jesus, and see Heaven!

- If you want to learn more about Jesus and Heaven, read one, or all, of the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John within the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each book serves as an eyewitness account of the miracles He performed, His sacrifice, and His promise to you!",,Youtube
I heard its healthier to walk on grass than pavement. Is that true?,,Youtube
"I dream to live in a more walkable place. Luckily where I live, I'm by a train station that's pretty reliable so I can take it to work. It goes along a major highway so it's pretty satisfying how much rush hour traffic I zoom past. But other than that, I still have to drive to go to the gym or grocery store bc my town loves huge parking lots and fast 8 lane streets that make everything so far and dangerous to bike along side :( Someday!",,Youtube
This animation is so cute,,Youtube
"My great grandma is 92, alive and well. Mind is sharp. She never learned to drive. She walked every where. She walks down her neighborhood till this day. The younger generations, who do not move as much- I can tell have different mindsets and wont be as strong at that age. It really makes me look at it differently and get up moving more. It’s just harder in today’s driving society. Everyone’s in a rush, speeding and texting and driving. Last time I went for a walk and someone almost turned into me.",,Youtube
"Alright alright, I'll get up from my computer and take a walk. Perhaps touch a little grass? Oh I mussnt spoil myself..",,Youtube

My rescue dog takes me out on three walks a day and that’s my favourite time of the day,,Youtube
"Another benefit I rarely hear about when people talk about walking is that you are using your Soleus muscle, which is sometimes called the “second heart”. Using that muscle contributes to efficient blood flow by helping to pump blood and fluids back up into the upper part of your body, aiding circulation and cardiovascular fitness!",,Youtube
How many of you love walking more than jogging or running,,Youtube
"Oh yes, compared to Europe, most American cities don’t have enough space for walking.",,Youtube
10.000 steps a day is just a random number someone made up in the sixties of the 20th century and has no scientific research to validate it. When you walk a full hour you just have made 5000-6000 steps. So just figure how fanatic you must be and idle time you must have  to reach 10.000 steps each day without any proven health benefits.,,Youtube
I walk regularly sometimes 2 mi.or more . I jaywalk to the grocery store.,,Youtube

I average 15000 steps a day without much effort. I just enjoy walking instead of taking the subway or bus and here in Berlin there are sidewalks on every street. I even start my day with a 50 minute walk to uni sometimes :D,,Youtube
"Propaganda. They want to take away your mobility. Don't let them. They'll do this via the salami tactic and the greenhouse gas hoax. If climate change was really an issue, all that private planes would have been grounded years ago and not be used by those who tell you to reduce your carbon footprint.  And I'm saying this as someone who has never owned a car. Walking is healthy, but you don't need the government to do it. It's a trap. Don't fall  for it.",,Youtube
"My average this week is 35k steps a day. Gas price has skyrocketed, cabs are expensive af compared to just a couple years ago, even publica transport is expensive these days... So f*ck it, I walk.",,Youtube
Even a walking game like the one i found called pikmin bloom motivated me to walk daily even for a bit. Plus its cute!,,Youtube

Lost 60 lbs and have kept if off for 3 years just by walking. Some days I would walk less but made it a crucial part of my routine. My life drastically changed after I started walking daily.

Little steps like these make a world of difference!,,Youtube
I wish I can walk without thinking I might not get home alive 😢 I really hope that world is safe to walk around and get a 20k walk or even 10k 😢,,Youtube

"Adding to the Vancouver study for a counterpoint, it feels like the increase in walkable space helped those who could walk those spaces while increased the drive time of everyone else who needed to commute through those spaces and it feels like it probably greatly impacted time in traffic of those who needed to commute. It did not seem like an equitable solution in its implementation from the times I've visited.",,Youtube

Walking the earth like Cane from Kung Fu,,Youtube
"In my opinion, this is a new low for Ted-Ed. The video starts out by telling you about Jean Beliveau, who walked 10,000 steps a day, which is approximately 5 miles per day. The narrator states that Jean spent the night in jail and couldn’t get released the next morning, which is the hook to keep you watching to find out what happened to him.  Then this video goes on to spew a bunch of positive results related to walking and then concludes by telling you that Jean got released from jail without providing any details. In my opinion, this video is just click bait and I’m going to unsubscribe from Ted-Ed.",,Youtube

"The ""these steps don't have to be taken continuously"" point is great to highlight, I think! Thinking that you need to take 10k steps at once sounds super daunting. 500 steps fairly often is much more manageable to think about!",,Youtube

"10,000 😂 i have that by lunch. maybe i should slow down cause i usually have between 20- 24,000 steps per day.",,Youtube
"The 10,000 steps didn't start as science, but as an advertisement for a Japanese step tracker. You can get benefits with less. Benefits start at 2500, and 7000-9000 is great. After that you don't gain much.

I have hip problems, so I have to feel the right amount on my body. Without exercise I become weak, but more is not always better either.",,Youtube

"I'm an ex-military with knee effusion. My NCO used to take the squad to stairs of buildings and would make us run up and down the stairs and we did that for years. Now, he meant good, he was a great person with a heart of a gold, but even any well meaning person can fall under misinformations. I'm pretty sure every one of us in the squad are suffering some sort of busted knees or another. 

TED is like this a lot of times. You guys sometimes post some real gold, and other times, you just say completely unchecked, unreviewed information. Back your claims with sources and citations. It allows viewers to check the informations themselves. You have double digit million subscribers, you should really be mindful of your suggestions.",,Youtube

"It's true. I used to live in the city and walk everywhere. I had no health problems. But then I moved to the suburbs to care for an elderly parent, and started using the car a lot more. Almost immediately my weight shot up, as well as all the other symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Now I'm back in the city, and I started walking last spring. After only 9 months of walking, I no longer need my blood pressure medication or statin. And my blood sugar that had been edging closer to pre-diabetes is back to normal. I also lost 50 pounds of weight.

I was lucky. My health returned quickly because I had walked since an early age. Originally a suburbanite, I moved to the city after high school because that's where the affordable housing was. I couldn't afford my own car, and the busses were so infrequent that I just set out on foot to my destination, and often got there on foot before a bus ever came. After my finances improved, I kept walking as much as I could, because it always felt better. And I saved a fortune on health club memberships and equipment. You don't even need shoes; I used to walk barefoot all the time.",,Youtube

There is no way I'd have the discipline to walk that much day after day if I didn't have my wee dog.  Plus they make you feel good because they are such joyful creatures.  They love you unconditionally, and are overjoyed with happiness when you return to them even after just a few hours.  I'm 75 and do an average 10K brisk steps every day.  Sometimes a lot more.

"Jean Béliveau walked across countries to circumnavigate the globe, sometimes staying in unconventional places like jail cells. His story highlights the health benefits of walking, including improved mood, reduced anxiety, stronger bones, and a lower risk of chronic diseases. Walking is accessible and environmentally friendly, particularly in walkable communities, which promote social connection and reduce emissions. However, many cities prioritize driving infrastructure over walkable spaces, limiting accessibility. Solutions like greenways and simple community improvements can make areas more pedestrian-friendly, encouraging healthier lifestyles. Béliveau's 75,000-kilometer journey underscores the profound impact of walking, even in smaller amounts.",,Youtube

"I'm an American housewife, and I average about 10-12k steps per day with minimal time spent outdoors. I spend maybe 30 minutes jogging on my elliptical daily, with a small amount of either light weight lifting or Pilates, but I don't have a hardcore exercise routine anymore. I just moved from a tiny rural town to a ""rural"" town next to a small city, and the differences are significant. My rural town actually had sidewalks everywhere and wider roads, but my new town has more businesses and delivery options, despite lacking sidewalks. I actually have a popular paved public trail in my community, and it runs right behind my house, so I have that option.

What helps me stay active is having young children, a larger home, remodeling, taming an unkept yard, reorganizing regularly, and having to clean after multiple pets. I don't have to walk aimlessly nor use the public trail because I have so many chores at home. I'm busy every single day. 

The larger space definitely makes a difference because I was normally getting 6-8k steps before moving locations, instead of my current 10-12k steps. I even reach above 12k steps about twice per week. It's amazing. 

I'm sure it's nice to take walks in a city with old architecture, or an area surrounded by a forest, but I'm fine with high plains and the hillside because I stay busy. While infrastructure is a common problem in most of the US (and similar countries), white collar jobs, office settings, driving all day, and digital remote work from home are what result in inactive lifestyles. Sitting all day has become normalized even in places with great infrastructure. I'm aware that a daily intense workout routine, with a lifestyle that involves mostly sedentary activity, does not have the same results as moving around all day, throughout the day. Most people prefer the comfort and/or pay of a modern sedentary job, but it comes with health risks. 

Not everyone can have an ideal lifestyle with balanced levels of comfort and mandatory physical movement though. Any effort to exercise makes a difference, and that's something everyone should prioritize over sedentary entertainment. We only have one body, after all.",,Youtube

My area has only a very small, limited bus route.",,Youtube
"Great advice. Just a point of interest, the ""10k steps"" does not come from any research on the optimal number of steps for the average person. It comes from the translation of the original pedometer created in Japan, who's name translates to ""10,000 Steps"". In later years testing was done and the average optimal number of steps is actually 13.5k. Any additional steps had negligible benefits. Most Smartwatchs will have a pedometer app to keep track of the number of steps per day, but a personal pedometer can also be used and most are fairly inexpensive. Walking is great for the health and wellness benefits listed, but it's also a great way to bond with your dog. ""What? You don't have a dog?"" I have another piece of advice. Having a pet also has health benefits and you'll be giving an animal a safe and loving home. ""Just a suggestion..."" 🐶✌️",,Youtube

"In the rural area I live, neighborhoods are not designed for walking. There are no crosswalks, no sidewalks, barely even a shoulder on the roads, and the speed limit for vehicles is high. It really sucks, and I don’t know why these neighborhoods, which were planned, have no accessibly except for vehicles. It is one reason I hate living here, but it is affordable homes, at least.

Still, some folks try to walk them, and it terrifies me. I’ve seen people trying to walk their dogs on a road with a 45 mph speed limit, curves, and nothing but a 1-2 foot wide shoulder. 😢 But where else are they going to go? Drive 20 minutes somewhere so they can walk their dogs?",,Youtube

"It's true that a walkable neighborhood helps keep people healthy but what do you do if you live in one that was built for the auto & moving away isn't practical? I have various routes to walk in mine which do NOT require crossing a highway & do not have traffic lights which slow down my pace. It's taken a while to discover these routes because my paranoid neighbors keep vicious dogs behind fences of questionable strength & that gets my heart racing. So my neighborhood is an obstacle course. Sometimes I drive a short distance to walk along a lake or hike in the foothills because I believe being in nature is also beneficial for relieving stress. Other workable locations might be reservoirs, parks, & malls (good for laps). Finally, I recommend buying good quality walking shoes because they can increase your distance & enjoyment of pounding that pavement. And mix it up; walking the same beat gets boring.",,Youtube

"""The study shows walkability reduces the feeling of loneliness""

1) The study is just a survey.
2) Only 181 participants in the survey.
3) The loneliness itself was not defined in the study. Participants were asked if they feel lonely, so they probably had their own definition in mind, when they responded.
4) People willing to participate in such a study are in general probably less depressed with lesser feelings of isolation or loneliness. Depressed people probably won't be much willing to fill a survey and such.
5) In general it was just a one study, not like a meta-summary of many studies.

I am not against walkeable cities, but loneliness and depression is a very complex topic and I hate they it's abused like this to streghten certain ideas.",,Youtube

I walked 10,053 steps in one day and it pretty much destroyed my feet. I couldn't sleep properly because of the constant burning pain and I was hobbling around today in agony when I wasn't either soaking my feet in a foot spa or putting them on ice bricks...

Get moving people! Don't go to the gym this January if you're not used to it. Start by walking, then jogging, then add short sprint, then try core exercises at home, THEN get that gym membership. It's hard to start, but once you you build a healthy habit you'll only want more lol.",,Youtube

"The best thing besides living in a city where you naturally walk a lot (for  commute etc), is to have a work that involves some degree of walking such as the one am i in which is medical: we have to walk quite a lot to first get in hospital which is big, then see patients, then back office, then back to patient 2 etc, etc (and on top of that lot of movements involved to examinate the patients).


Why having to walk in your work  great? Because You're getting paid while walking unlike a job where it's 98% sitting then you have to add extra time in your day to walk ! So it's more time efficient, basically you get your steps and health in your work hours.",,Youtube

I even get my 10k steps at home because it's become so boring that I feel like just getting the steps at home is easier.,,Youtube

Damn this realistically describe my current workout routine. Only muscle training and no cardio bc here in Vietnam especially suburban areas often have little to no sidewalk bc of businesses put out signs and goods out on them + congestions is often so many bikers go on sidewalks too. A big no no is that there are barely any parks in the outskirts and the air is most often always polluted anywhere you go. Basically if I have to do cardio I have to breathe in polluted air and is subjected to non-consistent routine bc sidewalk are uncoordinated to walk a straight line thus make me dont do it at all and a treadmill is hella expensive. 😂,,Youtube

"Studies show that the majority of health benefits are achieved by walking about 7.5k steps per day. Between 7.5k and 10k steps/day, the additional health benefits begin to taper off, along with improvements in mortality rates. The widely promoted “10,000 steps” goal originated as a marketing strategy by a Japanese company that released one of the first pedometers. The number was chosen partly because the Japanese character for 10,000 resembles a person walking energetically.

In summary, the key is to maintain an active lifestyle.",,Youtube

"I've been routinely walking for a couple of months now and it definitely has mental benefits. Some advice for people who have flimsy mental health like I do:  try avoid listening to music when you are out on walks. It's really nice listening to songs you love when you are out enjoying a walk but it's also good to take some time in the day to not be distracting yourself with stuff and give your mind a chance to process things or to just not think at all if that's what you need. I find it really grounding to walk and just hear the world and very interntionally plant myself in reality.

Anyways, for the last 5 years I have gotten my steps in everyday except for a week when I got sick (didn't wanna spread the germs). I have had friends note my mood improvements and I feel so much better, it's also great to listen to audiobooks and podcasts.

"I grew up in Vancouver. People complained about the greenway for lots of reasons. 

They mostly all boil down to how north America was structured for cars, and because of unaffordable housing in the city. 


Outside of vancouver, 
Municipalities are approving suburb developments rapidly to support increasing population demand. Imo they’re poorly thought out. The house may be cheaper than vancouver, but there’s no community and you’re attached like an umbilical cord to your car to live your life. More people drive in to work as most jobs are still in the city. This reinforces car culture and the assumption that these greenways are an inconvenience because of the increasing congestion.



That said, the Greenway is a wonderful addition. When I was lucky enough to live in Vancouver, I almost never relied on a car. I could do all my grocery shopping and chores on foot and took the bus for everything else. My friends and I would grab a coffee and go for a long walk all the time.


People complain about the bike lanes and everything but I support Vancouvers is green city initiative! 

I think the problem is really complicated. Vancouver needs to address affordability while also working together with other municipalities to ensure that they develop more walkable communities rather than the endless car-reliant suburbs I keep seeing. The green city initiative is trying to change a culture, but Vancouver doesn’t exist in a vacuum.",,Youtube

"SOME MATHEMATICAL FACTS ABOUT 2025

1.  2025, itself, is a PERFECT square:  
     
      45² = 2025

2.  It is a product of TWO squares, viz:
      
       9² × 5² = 2025.

3.  It is the sum of THREE squares, viz:
 
     40² + 20² + 5² = 2025.

4. 2025 is the next PERFECT SQUARE 
     that comes after the year 1936.

     44² = Year 1936
     45² = Year 2025

5.  It's the sum of cubes of all the
     single digits, from 1 to 9. viz:

     1³ + 2³ + 3³ + 4³ + 5³ + 6³ + 7³  
     + 8³ + 9³ = 2025.

Year 2025 shall be an interesting year for all Walkers here!",,Youtube

"You can triple the benefit if you walk landing on your outer forefoot just under the pinky toe.

"What a wonderful video. I would love to see more walkable spaces in America, it is very annoying to try to walk/run to the park and have to run on a road that smells horrible. Having less cars in a way makes a community more free as not everyone can drive due to poverty, not of age, or other legal reasons.",,Youtube

"When I moved, I found out Iwas going to have to walk to school bc it’s close and my parents couldn’t drive me. At first I thought walking to school everyday would be annoying and I would hate it. But, I learned it’s not even that bad and now I love walking everywhere. In fact, I prefer to walk to school now rather than drive bc it gets me in a better mood and makes me feel productive. When I tell people at my school that I walk there everyday, they’re always like “oh I feel bad for u” or “why would u do that to yourself.” 🤦🏽‍♀like walking is literally good for u even if it’s just a little bit each day.",,Youtube
Better off stop listening to others and just listen to yourself. Even the so called experts never agree on anything. As this video proves.,,Youtube
