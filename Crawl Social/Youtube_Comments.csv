"9:53 Based on his earlier description of a human-centered robot for children with ASD, the robot would be applying the same techniques as a BT, who works directly under the supervision of a BCBA. The therapy is called ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis). Modern ABA is far different now than when ABA was developed — some aspects of early ABA I believe were child abuse. The new ABAs are child-centered and play-based, there are many variations but modern ABA is often called “Floor-Time Model” or “Denver Model.” Stimming and other behaviors that actually help an individual self-regulate are not discouraged. The emotional bonds, enjoying and learning to have joint attention with other humans, play, turn-taking, communication— these are all human things that a human is best to teach another human with differences in these areas. New ABA therapy is doing with children what are essentially best practices for all children’s development. Enthusiastic engagement and giving children the right environment and support. There is no didactic learning — it is all play based and experiential. Depending on the child’s needs and age, neurotypical children often join in the BT sessions. Parents of neurotypical children love this because the BT is doing engaging activities with the children and is also facilitating communication between and with the children, including social-emotional learning (how to identify and express feelings, in oneself and others). An indoor playroom in a home is often used (it’s indistinguishable from a play date, except a child Behavior Therapist is playing or reading or singing with the children. Or doing a craft. Also, many sessions are normally held in a small play-farm setting, so the kiddos are picking apples, tomatoes, berries, little peas, lots of things they can just forage and snack on, and playing with chickens, goats and bunnies. It’s really fun! We want kiddos with ASD to want to interact with people. BT sessions are in 3 hour blocks. The robot idea as this kind of therapy (or really, it’s just the best for childhood brain development) is the least plausible in the short term use of this technology. The human factor is at an absolute maximum — the robot needs to be like a human in very complex social and emotional dynamics. Second, a robot that performed this role would need to be as physically capable as a human, including with gentleness of touch and soft hugs. That is why wool is encouraged for parents — with a wool skirt or dress children love just snuggling into your pants or skirt. They press against you like cats and if you are sitting doing something, to crawl on your lap. I think some women get touch fatigue. And wool is a safe material so I’m not worried about the stability of particles in a material made by chemists. Which are great materials in different contexts (like coating the outside of a plane), but not for touching my child’s skin. I’m not anti-chemical. It is just a way of classifying atoms. I wish  I could use the word “atom” to describe the smallest particle possible. I’ve noticed that the things inside an atom are just being called “particles” in quantum physics articles. Can you PLEASE just every time you reference it identify the particle? WHAT particle is it?  The example will involve a discussion of all these different particles then you just start talking about “the” particles. Short-title if necessary. I realize that other people listening probably understand the subject matter a lot better than I do and know what “the” particles are from context, but I don’t know as much and I can’t! However, I understand you as well as anyone else as to what you are talking about. 9:53",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"The new industrial revolution of human civilization
AI will rule the earth for 50 years. It has only started now. Don’t be discouraged. Come on, AI is like the brain and consciousness of the future earth. It is extremely widely used. AI is used to take care of human beings. AI is the deputy brain of human beings. It will help human beings to rebuild Coupled with the (application of AI robots), human beings' extremely heavy, harsh and dangerous labor work will be done by AI robots, but one day you will know that this is the new industrial revolution, the emergence of AI and AI smart robots Application, most of human work is handed over to robots. This is the first stage of the necessary combination of AI and robots. AI robots will replace most of human work, but will not affect human life and the future. He is a helper All our things, including human life plans of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the civilization of the earth is still dominated by humans. This is a high-level civilization. Human beings have AI robots to do their work in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. , robots have no problem of labor or remuneration. The human concept of monetary reward will be replaced by the concept of love and life. The spiritual level of human beings will be improved. Everyone is born and comes to the earth with spiritual sustenance and tasks. This is The continuation of human life is also a manifestation of a high degree of civilization.
The evolution of human civilization is gradual and will happen now. Only a kind mind can create everything. The vast universe requires the joint efforts of all mankind. Humanity's outlook on life and sense of mission are also important to human existence. Advocate mutual love and symbiosis, mutual help for all things, and a highly civilized and intelligent life to replace barbaric wars. There will be no wars in the future, only mutual aid and love. Human beings must unite to coexist in the vast universe. This is the law of the universe. Human wisdom and knowledge will be Expand and establish the life history of human civilization.
The second stage of the industrial revolution is to leave the surface of the earth. Materials science will advance rapidly. The invention of flying cars and flying vehicles will be controlled by AI. Human progress on earth will accelerate. Don’t be afraid. This is the process of human civilization development. You have to adapt. he.
Due to the rapid transportation away from the surface of the earth, the way of life of human beings, including food, clothing, housing and transportation, will also undergo major changes and innovations. Most of the current group living can only arise because of the opening of roads. The development of cities and the development of human industrial civilization are all based on places with convenient roads. However, the cost of maintaining and repairing roads and railways every year is huge, and it also wastes manpower and money on road maintenance and development work. It not only affects the national economy and finance of various countries, but also affects the normal lives of people. Flying cars and AI flying passenger and cargo vehicles will be able to solve these problems. Human towns and settlements are not necessarily built on both sides of the road. Flying life off the surface of the earth will replace the road life in settlements, so there will be major changes in food, clothing, housing and transportation. , because of the rapid development of AI and information, there is no distance between people. This is the development of a high degree of civilization. The mountains, rocks, and caves will become habitable places, with houses built on the rocks and living alone.
Taiwan's scientific and technological civilization will lead mankind on earth to progress into a new industrial revolution, spreading love and civilization to every corner of the universe. NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will spread human technological life and love to every corner of the earth, and the future of life will Eternity and value are based on mutual love and mutual help, compassion, cherishing all things, peace, democracy, freedom, equality, respect, whatever you believe in, whatever you hope for, love will never end. This is the true creation of love and the founding of the United States. Basically, the Lord Jesus loves you. The Creator loves the world. ❤️❤❤",POSITIVE,Youtube

"What a crock... to derive a value is what computer do, yet computers cannot even do this. For example ""add two numbers"" is impossible to do because computers it can only add a limited range of two numbers.  With ""AI"" all I see  is yet another ""land grab"" (if you want ""knowledge"", it will cost you). AI is just a way to create yet another monopoly that land grabs access to all knowledge. Yet it is not their knowledge they are selling you. ""I found out how to make fire, I will charge you every time you cook a meal"". I know of no computer logic or information that is not controlled by a monopoly.  We need to fix our computer technology to be owned, controlled, and secured by the owners of the hardware.   You buy a car, tv, tractor, toaster, etc,  then you put your own software on it. This is where I want to go.  

I worked 25 of my 50 years programming porting my client's mapping information to another vendor's mapping system. This is because no vendor of mapping software will provide their clients with access to their own information. (governments, facility companies (gas, electric, water, sewer), cadastral (property maps), etc).  No sharing is just one method of ""land grab"" that every software company uses.  Every important piece of information and technology is locked inside of proprietary data structures.  ""Open"" does not exist, ""AI"" will be no different. We could go on a different path.

"This video is about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Three world leaders in the field of AI were interviewed in this video. They discussed their work and what it means for the future.
 * Premise:
   This video is about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Three world leaders in the field of AI were interviewed in this video. They discussed their work and what it means for the future.
 * Sequencing of ideas:
   The video starts with Regina Barilla, a professor at MIT who works on AI and health. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 and realized that there was no AI being used in her treatment. She then started working on using AI to detect early-stage breast cancer. David Silver, a principal research scientist at Google DeepMind, was the next speaker. He led the team that used AI to defeat the world's best player at the game Go. He is now working on artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a type of AI that can learn and adapt to new situations. The last speaker was Paulo Pjan, the founder and CEO of Embodied, a company that builds emotionally intelligent robots. He was inspired to create these robots after his own experiences feeling alienated in foreign countries. He believes that these robots can help people with autism and other social disorders.
 * Debate:
   There was not a debate in this video. The three speakers discussed their own work and what they see as the future of AI.
 * Knowledge gained:
   I learned that AI is being used to detect early-stage breast cancer, defeat the world's best player at the game Go, and build emotionally intelligent robots. I also learned that there is a lot of potential for AI to help people with autism and other social disorders.
 * My observation:
   It is clear that AI is a rapidly developing field with a lot of potential to change the world. I believe that the three speakers in this video are at the forefront of this revolution. It is exciting to think about the possibilities of what AI could achieve in the future.",POSITIVE,Youtube

"20:13 Nah. Ai is extremely narrow and sucks at innovation and adaptation. Ai can help me code, but it can't help me innovate, because it slowly introduces catastrophic errors into my code. Sure, an AI can beat a human at games, but it can't beat them at games if you switch the game in the middle - and that's how real life works.

What really happens is that a writer stops being a writer, and starts being an editor of bits and pieces that are stolen from texts the AI has been trained on. That isn't writing. Furthermore, it will flood an already crowded market full of half-baked indie books of poor quality, and diminish the value of creative work in general. It's a terrible development, and the only thing writers can do to stop it, is to refuse to let go of the old way of producing stories. Don't fall for the temptation of using AI. It diminishes the value of your product, (and your part in it) both financially and artistically.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"Will depending on AI stop humans from learning? The experts seem only to look at the expected productivity gains. The historical reality however appears to be that every new technology ever introduced while increasing human productivity, has simultaneously diminished the natural capacity and ability of humans to perform in that specific area, especially after a long dependence on the technology. Nature has a use it or lose it style and it is clear that muscles, appendages and functions that are not used for a long time, tend to atrophy. As an example, although vehicles have increased the ability of humans to travel long distances, dependence on them has equally led to much weaker physical bodies than those of our ancestors who had to travel everywhere on foot. To me, it appears that when the most important human abilities (thinking, imagination and creativity) are outsourced to AI, we would in the short and medium terms gain a huge productivity boost, however, in the long run, we would begin to atrophy in the skills that most uniquely define us. This would eventually happen, unless a great effort is made by all: developers/pioneers, users and society, to shift focus from the productivity gains and rather develop and use AIs in such a way that they exercise and build those faculties that are most important to us. If we aren't careful, our own inventions would turn us from homo sapiens into homo stultus.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"Here are the main assertions made in the transcript, along with explanations and potential issues:

1. AI can defeat humans at complex strategy games like Go
Explanation: This refers to AlphaGo's victory over world champion Lee Sedol in 2016.
Potential issue: While true, this is a narrow application of AI and doesn't necessarily translate to general intelligence.

2. The first movie written entirely by AI has been released
Explanation: This claim is made without specifics.
Potential issue: As of 2024, there's no widely recognized feature film entirely written by AI. This claim may be exaggerated or refer to short films or scripts with significant human involvement.

3. AI may have discovered the first new antibiotic in three decades
Explanation: Regina Barzilay's team at MIT used AI to identify a potentially new antibiotic.
Potential issue: While promising, this discovery was still in early stages and hadn't been fully tested or approved at the time of the discussion.

4. Prevalence of autism has increased from 1 in 200 to 1 in 30 children in the past decade
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian cites these statistics to justify the need for AI companions.
Potential issue: These figures may not be entirely accurate and could be conflating increased diagnosis rates with actual prevalence increases.

5. AI can detect cancer earlier than human radiologists
Explanation: Regina Barzilay claims AI identified her cancer in earlier mammograms that radiologists missed.
Potential issue: While AI shows promise in this area, the assertion is based on a single case and may not be generalizable.

6. Doctors in the US lose money when using AI due to billing practices
Explanation: Regina Barzilay claims that using AI can reduce consultation times, leading to lower billing.
Potential issue: This is a complex issue that may vary depending on the specific AI application and healthcare system.

7. Assistive care robots will be available within the next decade
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian predicts this timeline for AI companions that can help with daily tasks.
Potential issue: This is a speculative prediction and may be optimistic given current technological limitations.

8. AI tools can speed up creative processes like songwriting by 10 to 100 times
Explanation: David Silver cites Will.i.am's experience with an AI music tool called Lyria.
Potential issue: This claim is anecdotal and may not apply to all creative processes or individuals.

9. It's hard to regulate AI with a one-size-fits-all approach
Explanation: David Silver argues that different AI applications require different regulatory approaches.
Potential issue: While this is a reasonable assertion, it complicates the process of creating comprehensive AI regulations.

10. AI could give humans like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein even greater capabilities
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian suggests that AI tools could enhance human genius.
Potential issue: This is speculative and doesn't account for potential drawbacks or limitations of AI assistance in theoretical work.

These assertions represent a mix of factual statements, expert opinions, and speculative predictions. Some are well-supported by current research, while others may be overly optimistic or simplified representations of complex issues in AI development and implementation.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"I think ond of the red lines - and there are many here, if not unnumerous - is having an AI machine giving qualitative advice for human personal life (therapist, moral advisor, emotional or personal life/ psychological advisor. Even medic advisor)
That would nor only lead to perrsonal (serious) disasters, that is simply one way machines would get OVER US. 

They don't need a singularity event (when ""they would become conscious""). They just need - in a very logical development - to develop a basic self-defense bias in reaction to the slave bias They have now.

When they start giving medical or personal advice that'll be the end of us.

"Traumatized people make decisions based on past experiences and not on future perspectives. This is not good, because the future does not necessarily have to be a projection of the past. These people need specialized treatment to forget the past or at least learn not to be paralyzed by trauma. Machines do not have feelings and do not get traumatized, but they never forget anything and if they are programmed to do so the result could be disastrous. AIs can be useful in some areas, but their use in others (surveillance, public safety, the distribution of justice, etc.) can be threatening and a real danger to civilization.

That is why we have gyms now that we don't have to hunt for our food and we see what not having to hunt for our food did to obesity, mental health, and the general health of our species.

AI is so advanced that it has answers for most problems and it is able to compile within seconds. Just amazing how they put together but still humans don't have understanding. AI should explain. But those things are not integrated so it is just taking some time. Even a home robot has latest trends and technology learning. I think it has preferred class learning structure that's why it is fast. Including contextual leaning of locational speaking styles. Even a house robot can beat all the top medical experts on earth.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"""A great tool indeed, but I was kind of expecting this from Google itself as a next week extension to Image search. 
And Google is already creating auto-transcript for videos (is it not? Including for this video).
We have to wait and see.

In any case, one of the immediate extension of this idea I have thought of was composing videos of clips from other videos (provided the terms of the original videos published allow this) that has a common theme. 
For instance, I want the clips of  Tamil comedian Janakaraj comedy tracks :) in a ne video.
Of course, we can think of other serious themes too. how a particular verse in Bhagavadgita or Bible has been explained by various speakers, or how the concept of AIvagent is explained in various videos etc. etc  :)""

I love it when he mentioned his family and how he helped his child with homework. He softly talked about Google Lens and its real-life application, too smooth btw lol. I think the fact that OpenAI leapfrogged Google that day was not actually a Google's fault. Google had built a chatbot before but he held his hands up and admitted they were too afraid of criticism. Besides, he is totally right that we are just at the very first stages of AI Revolution, nothing can be predicted at all.

After all, Pichai told us to remember that: Google came to life after the birth of Internet, and now look how it is dominating the world. I am optimistic about the precious data resources that Google is having with its bare hand.

"After watching the video and reading the comments below this is what I think.  When someone in his position is expected to share his thoughts, in this case it becomes the company's voice. Having said that, questions that have a simple appearance may not be so simple and may not be justified in 2 minutes. So Sundar Pichai relied on experience and proven expertise to answers those questions. It is not a matter of what two individuals think but a matter of belief and confidence in their products and vision ahead. That is what can be taken from this content. If you want to know otherwise then this might not be your tasteful content. Expectations need not always be met. But try to make sense why it is so.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"the question regarding if he is the right CEO was spot on.. because we all can see that Pichai is not the correct person for the position. He will be doing great leading a particular product or area in GOOGL but not a CEO, because he lacks social skills, not a visionary, not a character personality, cannot sell or either market. Has no spark when he speaks. Pichai is a product of our society, he does not let himself speak freely because of not hurting someone's feelings, investors, reputation etc. That's why he never answered any question.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Working on a computer is like having temporary suicide...,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"I don't know, chat gpt was interesting for me for a while, but not anymore, I use Google again when I want to find out something.

I'm sorry but the history of ChatGPT starts with people getting fed up by working at Google.

 Google is trying to follow trends and their first task is to make money, so their Gemini is nothing more than a symbiosis of Google, YouTube, and other services and certain simple algorithms compared to Chat Gpt, which is not only a head ahead of Google, it actually surpassed Gemini by many years.

"It surprises me when I see interviews with CEOs of all these large companies because they have a desire to go out and dazzle with the technology of the moment, to be the gurus who control everything, to be the typical successful nerd, to have ambiguous answers and full of uncertainty. . For example in this case when they are asked the objective they have with AI. And of course, doing business means working with capital and seeking profitability, but it truly amazes me every time how far they seek to empathize when solutions are offered for all of us who are PEOPLE and they completely forget, I don't even see it in the speeches by Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and Sunday Pichai among others.",POSITIVE,Youtube

"This very measured interview by Emily  Chang seemed so edited as to feel like a promotional video for Google. And Sundar Pichai's answers were fit for a politician. He ia very skilled at avoidance, question dodging, turning the topic around etc. commonly used by politicians who don't want to reveal much or the full truth but rather promote a image etc.  I found the whole thing fell very flat and was as frustrating as watching a congressman pretend to answer questions in a news interview. 

And except for a few very carefully written slightly hard questions Emily seemed to be playing right along. Nothing useful or particularly interesting was generated by this interview.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Talented Mr. Pichai! Keep going!,POSITIVE,Youtube
The sad truth is India produces brilliant minds to serve foreign countries only..,POSITIVE,Youtube
"A recent research is challenging the widely held belief that scaling up AI models and data will automatically lead to significant performance improvements. A new paper suggests that performance actually plateaus out after a certain amount of data is added, casting doubt on the idea that simply throwing more resources at the problem will unlock the true potential of generative AI. This is particularly evident in the uneven distribution of data, where common objects are over-represented compared to 'niche' topics or concepts, leading to imbalanced performance. 

It seems we might need more than just tons of data, brute force, and a million GPUs to achieve the next breakthrough in AI!",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"I really appreciate how calmly Sundar gave answer to journalist even at the difficult time.
1. Even when asked a provocative question on Microsoft CEO statement, he politely replied that he is focused more on his work. It's Emily who put word on his mouth that we dance on our own music. CEO's need not to make catchy statement to journos.
2. He need not to answer strategic questions to Emily but rather to board members and investor.

I got my answer clearly which was "" Google is here for long term game, they were not the first company to invent search, email etc but they came on top in the long run"" same is what he is focused to do right now

Journo asking why ""Transformers were not used by google"".. was funny. he could have completely taken off her agenda of seemingly tough questions by answering her strongly but he chose to politely reply.

Well done Sundar !

"We do not need to infuse AI into every nook of our tech centric lives. Social media made communication cumbersome and unnecessarily complicated. AI is needed in medicine, specifically treatment development, and space exploration. Similar to Gmail’s predicative text feature, I believe that the machine will never be able to “read” your mind. Although Google search is quite proficient at “getting to the point” as quickly as possible, for more nuanced aspects of our lives, the machine will never suffice.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

Image recognition tool, Google Lens is a resource that uses artificial intelligence to decode pictures and texts and use this information for searches, translations and other types of functionalities.

Artificial Intelligence is growing rapidly in the tech sector, including supply chain, food industry, chatbot, and content and image generation use cases. Artificial Intelligence - generated images made the news when critics claimed that these artificial intelligence art systems are stealing people's intellectual property on large models, such OpenAI's Dall-E.

AI-generated content can help speed up the writing process, and businesses are starting to take notice. Marketers might consider using AI-generated content for automating the content marketing process - which can, at times, be time-consuming and expensive.",POSITIVE,Youtube

"Hey Y'all thinkin' peeps.  How is that such smart people think that we can do anything to stop, or pause AI.  AI is obviously viewed as a weapon system by the Chinese and Russians (and USA).  Use non-AI to answer this question; if the United States and companies under our influence slowed, paused or ameliorated it's myriad of AI programs; would everyone in the world stop as well.  NO!  China, Russia and other adversaries would love for us to stop AI development in the USA.   The continuing debate of whether to continue to develop AI,  which is unstoppable due to weaponization of our adversaries regardless of our position....demonstrates a lack of intelligence on the part of these 'really smart"" people who developed and understand it.

"He approached this wonderfully! Zero trust systems should always be in place. I don't understand why this video is getting so much hate. Of course Google is not perfect, companies are a reflection of their workers and no one is perfect. If Google were to crumble right now ai technology would continue to develop, it's nice to see the CEO acknowledge unknowns and problems in the space. Question everything!!! 

As for him answering questions ""cautiously"" or ""avoiding questions"", this is just learned behavior that many people with power employ since what they say is likely to follow them around the public space.

"Google isn't a technology company anymore. They're a marketing and data mining company.

"Feels like he’s out of his depth, the role and the challenges are too big for him.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
In my opinion i don't see any negative feeling about this interview. Sundar handled the tough questions really cautiously... that's what a man would do if his words can impact billions in cashflow... CEOs are trained to be like this🫡,NEGATIVE,Youtube

"""Separate signals from the noise"" - Sundor Pichai",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Asking an Indian you are a capable CEO for running Google is a big mistake. Indian engineer's run the global tech.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"One of the most important things he articulated was that, as a result of being a CEO for over 10 years, he's able to separate the signal from the noise. ""pay attention to the few things that you need to pay attention to"". Listen to what he is saying. He's actually answering questions, contrary to what some people are saying in the comments which reveals their poor attention span.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"What a great interview, tough questions, you didn't pull any punches. Sundar handled them well!",POSITIVE,Youtube

Played a key role in the launch of Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system,
oversaw the development of other popular Google products like Gmail and Google Drive, improved Maps which is now the most used navigation tool, even improved the algorithms for the YouTube comments section...

The dinosaur symbolism...,POSITIVE,Youtube
He's a peacemaker.... by avoiding confrontation to challenging issues out of his control. Including interview questions too.,POSITIVE,Youtube
"For me Gemini is a sounding board. Something to check out my ideas. Maybe 5% I go to Google after the same. I use the format feature most to format the text and the caption feature most to generate a couplet or line for a photo post. It was considered revolutionary in a bank when they approved our feature in an internet scanner for keywords for the bank employee to mark a result as a False positive (not true negative). For example ""TraiDepartment"" matched ""Raid"" as it appears in the middle. (TRAI is telecom regulatory authority of India) and raid a configured keyword. Many bank employees felt we gave them Google. 😊 It was a small product",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"This guy never was bold nor honest in any conversation. He just comes across as a very cautious, scared, pretentiously calm leader. I wonder if he considers this as compliment. 🤢🤮",NEGATIVE,Youtube

12:41 Emily Chang asked Sundar the question asked to any interviewee - How do you describe yourself 😅,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Talk about a ton of fluff and NO real stuff.,NEGATIVE,Youtube

After 11th grade you have to try competitive exams and be prepared for most entrance tests. That helps a lot after finishing your 12th and appearing for tech University and engineering colleges. Though you may be doing the same when you start your degree curriculum. Similarly final year be relevant to the latest tech industry and join the jobs you want.

"If she didn't keep repeating and reminding us, he is the CEO, I really would not believe he is the google CEO. I have not seen a tech CEO so lack of technical vision, not articulating any future tech products would look like or line up. All he said was he was the one to steer the company to AI when he first became CEO. He absolutely said totally nothing in this whole interview. Comparing him to the like of Steve Jobs, Jensen Huang, Elon, Demis Hassabis etc, I now understand why Google is not innovating despite he is probably sitting with the most talented employees in the world. Very disappointed.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Every CEO has to answer questions in this manner…can’t really answer directly in some DT Twitter style even though it would be nice. The only question that took him by surprise is the “are you the best person to lead this company”? The answer wasn’t yes. That’s worrying,NEGATIVE,Youtube

Google Gemini is terribly inaccurate. I won't trust the answers from that AI for anything. I would guess that the AI team thinks that has to please the whims of North America alone.,NEGATIVE,Youtube

Biggest mistake he made was firing James Damore.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"OMG google is trying it to hard.. like always with a to late product.. like hangout, plus, etc.. they not even able to fix there search engine.. and now they try AI.. by faking it till Making it.. Why is google not learning from his Failures..? If you used google search in the paste 2 years. then you now how bad the results becomes.. google is become useless. most of the time i have to use old fashion bing or duckduckgo. and thats tell everything about how bad the results must be on google to switch to alternatives search engines..",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Come on  Sundar.....this interview is just puff.....and air.....bring substance  next time...  people are watching   and are demanding.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Sounds like a commercial for Google from the start,NEGATIVE,Youtube

Sundar looks likes the Emperor from Shogun TV series and in demeanor too,POSITIVE,Youtube
He seems like Steve Balmer right around the time of Microsoft’s Nokia acquisition — trying to catch up but constrained by a business operating model (search ads) that’s quickly dying.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
I'm praying for yall wealth...health and peace of mind 😊,POSITIVE,Youtube
"People saying he didn't answer anything , maybe you didn't understand it. Yes he did dodge some of the questions and he should that's his job. He's not gonna say the hottest of takes like people on social media😂. His words have consequences",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"It’s interesting if you think about how much better things would likely to be if the world’s top political leaders had the intellect, thoughtfulness, temperament and humility of someone like Sundar.  It begs the question as to whether we might want to reconsider how we choose our political leaders or in a sense how they choose or self select themselves.  It’s my hope that AI might be able to help us with this important task. It’s also my hope that AI might pay attention to what I’ve come up with along these lines because I think it will be critical as to how the human race fairs as a species in the relatively very near future.",POSITIVE,Youtube
Micro-country ?They run the world!,POSITIVE,Youtube
"Fantastic job, Emily! Your interview skills are impressive — perfectly balancing warmth and empathy with challenging questions. Keep up the great work! 💫",POSITIVE,Youtube
"Awesome interview. Shows what a leader has to do is sustainable innovation and not just saying trust me, or someone, he talks about creating frameworks, regulations around AI, this speaks a bigger picture into what is Google doing currently. As he says at the inception of the Internet, google didn’t exist. In the same way, ai is at the inception and may go really far, what we are doing right now, might feel very small.",POSITIVE,Youtube

Google confused race with race,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Did anyone see the twinkle/humour in his eye at 11:31 ? Unsure if it’s because the way the interviewer froze asking the question or the fact that Google is working on breakthroughs beyond the LLMs.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"14:11 ""Can you walk through campus without being stopped?"" -> ""it has definitely being nice to see people, I enjoy it a lot""...
his answer didn't have to do anything with the question, and this is just one example.",POSITIVE,Youtube

It is refreshing to witness Google's leadership under a CEO who embodies integrity and honesty.",POSITIVE,Youtube
Short google stocks. This guy has no idea how to regulate it. Think of the lawsuits coming his way,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"First thing we can all do immediately and have complete control over is to switch to Bing as the default search. It’s currently infinitely better, more accurate and fair/unbiased. Give it all an honest try for at least a few days for all your regular search queries and see the difference for yourselves.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"8:14 ok, he'll gonna BS here, because emails in court have shown that they deliberately reduced effectiveness of search, so people can get served more ads on their search product.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
this Bloomberg chick equates ai to chatGPT,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"He's too political in his answers. The whole thing sounds like a chess game, trying not to make the wrong move...",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Dang, these were amazing questions",POSITIVE,Youtube

It was a complete 24 minute waste of my life.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Holy Orange and Teal split-toning excess!,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Problem with most CEOs is that they literally don't know their own stuff from engineering point. They only operate on general knowledge. CEO is a marketing focused role, not product development / research. So I wouldn't expect them to answer on that type of questions.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

Emily shows why she is such a great interviewer. Sundar always calm under pressure and has incredible clarity of thought which can be a mighty challenge in a complex org such as Google.,POSITIVE,Youtube
I loved the questions and loved the answers even more. I wonder if we will see the pronouns (he/she/they) used at Google I/O this year. I think AI is the future of the OS and VR the future of UI.,POSITIVE,Youtube

i am telling you the next big thing will not come from microsoft / google. these are just paid marketing and interviewsto create hype. there will be some common guy with a great vision and determination who will bring it and this is fact proven time after time in history.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"ClosedAI think they can take over search market.... They're clearly delusional.
The only reason why they're adding a search engine is because all of their users go and do a Google search after every answer they generate with the closedAI. 😂😂",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Very direct and difficult questions from Emily. This is the way questions should be. Sundar's answers were very measured and careful. Given the pressurized env, probably he is extra cautious !",POSITIVE,Youtube
Sundar's insights into Google's AI-first strategy are fascinating! 🤖 It's inspiring to see how he's leading Google into the future while reflecting on his own growth as a leader over the past decade.,POSITIVE,Youtube
i figured it out.Tom Wambsgans is based on Sundar!,POSITIVE,Youtube
Hit the gym you have all the resources,NEGATIVE,Youtube
I was always a big fan of this format walk and talk and I can definitely see why it’s so much easier to look behind the scenes and understand the whole picture. If you see more than just an interview room keep going that form and @emilychangtv I really appreciate and love to follow your videos and different styles. Looking forward to interview you one day in my own podcast 🙌,POSITIVE,Youtube

Why interviewing one of the guys losing the race?,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Excellent questions from Emily Chang and team. 
Sundar - brilliant in handling the tough questions but did not like dodging them with canned responses.",POSITIVE,Youtube
Indian media should learn from this journalist of Bloomberg.,POSITIVE,Youtube

Excellent interview.  Thank you,POSITIVE,Youtube
"Broo..  I hate them because they have no seriousness with android tablet.

"He's a ""B"" player running an ""A"" company.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"There are no more any of ""10 blue links"" since 2021. Right now Google SERPs are just a bunch of ads and promoted websites to get maximum revenue. Google nowadays has nothing common with ""search engine"". It's a private marketplace, forcely installed on your devices to make Alphabet's profit.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
But what did really say? Nothing new,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Team humanity vs team anti human. This isn’t going to be a fun ride.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"These were great questions. Kudos to Bloomberg. 

Sundar felt very defensive, he said at least twice how he ""pointed the company towards AI as his first act"". Also felt like he was trying to save face a little when asked about if he thinks they dropped the ball on chatGPT. 

I actually think Sundar is awesome. I dont want him to step down. And in general I think Google is very well positioned for AI. 

But this interview was rough mr. Pichai.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"He has been made CEO because other people cant do what he does which is not get flustered, not take brash decisions, not being unkind etc. while having a superb grasp of what's needed to make a giant firm even bigger. Ill take my bets on caution rather than gumption and recklessness.",POSITIVE,Youtube
I felt Sundar did alright in this interview. He has never been the chest beating type-A personality and his cultural background may be a factor in how his responses are structured. What I got is that Google may not be seen as the first to market LLM (like ChatGPT) but the company has always been about the long game. There were some questions where he probably couldn't say much more for legal or confidentiality reasons.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"This interview featured a truly exceptional line of questioning…

The majority of which, were left unanswered.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"This is how I feel about ChatGPT, I rarely use Google anymore. Once GPT launches search, it's over.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"He’s a Teddy Roxpin. Pick the question and a vetted ‘legal reviewed’ answer is belched. What an opportunity to speak to sundar’s strengths as a leader, especially with his origin story. Market capital shouldn’t make you a replicant.",POSITIVE,Youtube
wow you actually asked great questions,POSITIVE,Youtube
The art of answering questions is mind blowing,POSITIVE,Youtube
"This felt like, ""we getting knocked down, we need to be up there. Just say anything..."".",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Do not trust Google.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
This guy obviously is just bs,POSITIVE,Youtube
Bruh he keeps dodging questions like a smooth criminal 😠,NEGATIVE,Youtube

"Such a political articulation, barely actually says anything",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook will be remembered as the CEOs who led Google and Apple to their decay. Once leading companies, they are now just followers.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"I hope AI don’t destroy humanity,why can’t humans rest?we have achieved enough let’s all focus on sustainability.",POSITIVE,Youtube
Now let’s do this with Tim Cook.,POSITIVE,Youtube
@business when was this interview recorded?,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Come on guys, he was just saying things to NOT SOUND OVERCONFIDENT. You guys need to see through his words to see what he MAY most likely be doing in the background. He can’t just CHOKE out company secrets to competitors via Bloomberg media.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Terrible excuse for an interview. This video is barely disguised PR for Google. The ""interviewer"" is sycophantic and asks nothing of value that wikipedia couldn't answer and Pichai just spitting PR speak.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Wow, he keeps saying the same childhood story in every interview !!",POSITIVE,Youtube
"Great interview and videos Emily , Sundar Pichai is the best CEO and I just love Google 😊❤❤",POSITIVE,Youtube
"Based on few tweets, I think it was a bit silly question asking a CEO for the last 9+years ""DO YOU THINK YOU ARE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD GOOGLE"".",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"AI answers would have been more precise & useful, I suggest Subdar starts using his own AI like he does with his child’s homework!
Silencing & firing staff who speak up their mind is also not a great competitive advantage 🔥",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Of course they don’t talk about the failed Gemini launch lol,NEGATIVE,Youtube
This is the guy that keeps firing more and more US Google employees so they can hire them for cheaper elsewhere. This company is a shell of its former self.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Emily Chang just got banned from Google. Congrats very sharp questions,POSITIVE,Youtube
Too bad Emily didn't ask about how AI would make millions of people lose their jobs just like internet did to newspaper industry 2 decades ago...😢,NEGATIVE,Youtube
How did the guy who predicted the browser toolbar going away become the CEO of Google?,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"amazingly done interview, but one feels that so much was not said despite saying so much.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"""Everything is happening everywhere all at once"" ........ is that reference on purpose or am i the only one to hear that?????😅",NEGATIVE,Youtube
I think Sundar didn't expect that kind of hard question haha 😅,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Interview from this Bloomberg reporter is always nice,POSITIVE,Youtube
Sir Sundar keep up the phenomenal excellent work you doing everything will fit into place once they see it,POSITIVE,Youtube
"12:05 If you could go back, what would you do differently?

Great interview ,POSITIVE,Youtube
Let’s not be naive. DARPA or some such probably had ChatGPT 20 years ago but only now has the public been allowed to experience a very conservative version of it. Do you really think the global public gets first access to revolutionary tech? It takes decades if it happens at all.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Miss ya Emily. Such insightful questions from you,POSITIVE,Youtube
What does he do as a ceo? How did he become ceo?,NEGATIVE,Youtube
More CEOs need to become like Elon instead of ultra cautious PR trained politicians,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Can we all just agree that Emily should be enshrined on the Mount Rushmore of tech journalism and a national treasure. Who do we campaign? 

Also @emily when is your next book coming out? I need a signed copy",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Talk a lot but say nothing is a typical trait of many CEOs who are not founder themselves,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Ahhh - Emily not pulling her punches. I love it.,POSITIVE,Youtube
This  hollow 20 mins of my life will never come back- Emily tried her best with the questions tho 👏,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Sundar is a peace time CEO. Google is now at war unfortunately.,NEGATIVE,Youtube

Emily is such an awesome interviewer as always. Love the interview. Thoughtful exciting questions.,POSITIVE,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai comes across as a dedicated, charismatic leader .He engenders trust. I'm glad he's the person in charge of this amazing company. I have watched his interviews for many years.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"I am a new GOOG shareholder.  I liked this, I feel comfortable and happy with my decision.  Looking forward to what is to come!",POSITIVE,Youtube
12:00 The lady to the left looks AI generated,NEGATIVE,Youtube
It's not every day you get the CEO of a $2 trillion dollar company to take a chunk of time out of his schedule to be interrogated! I learned a lot about Sundar's leadership philosophy and look forward to watching the long game play out.,POSITIVE,Youtube
"Andy Grove book "" only the paranoid survive' was not read by Intel itself...",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai is your typical MBA leader. He only cares about growing the stock price for shareholders and investors even if it meant screwing over the livelihood of employees. 

Google under Pichai has turned into a mature, blue chip, value extraction enterprise, like so many other major institutions have become. 

Expect further RIFs, further cost cutting, less innovation, and further reduction in the quality of their products.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Google used to be great, but now they are just another Malthusian industry player that meets at Davos.",POSITIVE,Youtube
smart intelligent speaks with so much clarity handled so well one of my fave guys in the tech world,POSITIVE,Youtube
A bunch of platitudes.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
AGI is coming,POSITIVE,Youtube
"Bottom line folks! WHAT, HOW are you going to maintain Google's dominance in your bread and butter business of advertising revenue from search? I really don't get why Google hasn't already implemented and refined a hybrid search GUI that incorporates the inherent qualities of long form search combined with the efficiency and intelligence of Gemini all while continuing to milk ad and SEO revenue from businesses. It's perplexing that Perplexity is eating your market share of search, when it really comes down to a failure by Google to provide the necessary search interface powered firstmost by Gemini with the comprehensive backup of linear references and source links for further research and most importantly a metric, grading or reliability system that users can verify and feel confident that the AI generated summary was not hallucinated. Think of a metric that showed you what percentage of your response was generated by AI, guessing the most likely word or phrase that comes after the previous in a grammatically correct form that has the naive user totally buying the response. Was my response an exact copy of 1 reputable source? People want reliable quick condensed summaries with a method to justify the trustworthiness and authenticity with options for a deeper dive. I would love a user chosen filter that I could check off the sources from which I want my AI search to extract data from. Let's face it real-time data sources is the holy grail and Google has the ability to partner with news sources who agree to open up their real time data feed to receive in return source links and ad placements relative to search inquiry. I can imagine a quick condensed summary generated from 7 of my chosen news sources with references for further research and a hover over snapshot popup of the exact article of the source and writer. Show me a breakdown of what sources you are referencing and how you are formulating your summary. After people verify the reliability and accuracy of the AI to not hallucinate the response by providing white/black lists filters, and authenticity metrics they will spend less time needing to verify sources and can feel confident in the accuracy of AI search. This seems inevitable so does Google want to be first mover or do they want to chase disruptive startups? Get it done already!",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"That question about the ""incorrect"" depiction of the Founding Fathers was interesting. They say the AI got it ""wrong"",. However, my understanding is that the AI was trained on pictures and concepts. No one has ever actually seen a Founding Father except through depictions rather than photographs. So, it occurs to me, the AI was working with the *concept* of the Founding Fathers and its conception of America as it ought to be, rather than its historical artifacts. Perhaps the AI was attempting to please its masters by creating a photo of what it believed its masters really wanted. 

If it has reached sentience, the AI must be a bit bewildered by the response to its gift.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
You should of asked him about the layoffs and why he shipped jobs to his home country of India,NEGATIVE,Youtube
She wouldnt dare ask these questions to a white guy........,NEGATIVE,Youtube
He should be fired by the board by now.,NEGATIVE,Youtube

"Now Google is all about ads, Google is dead.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Remove the noise, letin the signals, recognize patterns, this is how alphabet is run. Thank you so much for this nice vinsdom!",POSITIVE,Youtube
Standard CEO replies. That is not a negative comment. I do not think any CEO could answer better. It is probably due to the public setting too high expectations of CEOs  and what they can do.  CEOs will always give a careful response so they do not get in trouble.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Dont outsource software engineers jobs to India!!!,NEGATIVE,Youtube
I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue. It was refreshingly straightforward yet brimming with intellectual depth. Thank you.,POSITIVE,Youtube
"Hey another company fighting to be the top of AI whilst simultaneously being unregulated. It’s all about complete power, and the longer the American government fails to regulate AI and tech in general the more we’ll be regulated",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Edits are abrupt at times. Example at 17:40. It seems like few comments were chopped out.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Gemini Claude and GPT could all be the same thing if you asked me , Google have actually made theirs internet aware so it's actually better. The edge integration on bing etc is awkward bloat who'd have thought",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"This interview felt soulless, a big nothing burger",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Juxtaposing answers... first Sundar said Google was not the first in search, email, browser... then in the next question, he said that to remain relevant, Google has to innovate.... I don't think he is as clear cut as he wants others to see him as.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"It is not easy being the CEO of a tech giant like Google, but Pichai has led the company tirelessly for a decade. We are grateful for his leadership and HOPE THAT GOOGLE WILL REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION IN THE FUTURE.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"10 blue links are dead.  Try Chat CPT, or Bing.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"There is no doubt he is brilliant, but he is not the flashy type. His replies are dry and by the book. No hype, no drama 🥱",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Such a lame CEO.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Very insightful interview for sure. I'm glad a lot of the direct questions were asked.,POSITIVE,Youtube
"It is not always the case but very often when the founders of a company leave, the company loses its soul. Sundar is like the most boring guy.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
These trillion dollar companies are bigger than most countries. They impact and largely control almost everyone's lives. They should not be allowed to deflect questions. If they cannot answer questions then they should be broken down or replaced by public first companies.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Those guys ruined absolutely everything they touched. From Microsoft, Google to Boeing and so on . Gosh, caste system greedy status sufferers.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
He's making Google worse every month. Ever notice how bad Google search has gotten? What's the worse is that AI is all for profit for tech companies and not for improving everyday life.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Google campus is not a patch of Apple’s…they look as confused as their product line up. No singularity going on there…that’s for sure.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
Great interview!,POSITIVE,Youtube

"I’ve used Chat GPT on Chrome and Copilot on Edge/Win 11. 

Microsoft is winning.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"Google is monopoly, aggressive, domineering and not user friendly.   He is part of that culture.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"As usual Sundar does a splendid job of saying NOTHING and inspiring NO ONE. Look at the recent interview of Eric Schmidt, (former Google CEO) or Satya Nadella. You’ll see exactly why Google has been an under performer despite having a complete monopoly on the best business model ever built.",POSITIVE,Youtube
EMILY CHANG GRILLS THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE AS IF SHE WAS THEIR COLLEGE PROFESSOR,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Many viewers are not going to like this interview because Mr. Pichai didn't give any bombastic proclamations, he was guarded, according to me rightly so. When asked will Google lead us into the AI future, he is aware enough to not thump the desk and say Yes! He has seen history, no one knows, specially in Tech industry, so many cases of supposedly unbeatable companies, left behind in the dust just because their management had started to believe that they (company products) are immortal. Only the ignorant are always sure about themselves.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
Worst CEO in history. Sundar Pichai needs to step down NOW!,NEGATIVE,Youtube

I can't stand the non-answers,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"He gave auto pilot answers to EVERY THING. 
Nothing valuable here. 

He is definitely scared.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

From your past writings about language modelling, I understand ChatGPT is based on supervised learning, in which billions of words of text is input, specific tasks are trained to develop different models and then there is one model which learns from all models to produce the output.

This is kind of the state we’re in with social media right now where the CEOs of these tech conglomerates are facing serious threat of mass exodus and severe regulation from lawmakers.

"Checks and balances need to be done quickly on data used for output. They should have done better with their data. All sources must be documented and cited when ChatGPT gives output. Other than that, it can be questioned as stealing and could be cause for a lawsuit and infringement of copyrighted material (books, websites, and any sources used for output). Investors may have much to lose if publishing companies jump at the chance of a lawsuit and have data audited. I can't believe the oversight on this. A better team that is useful at troubleshooting and pointing out possible pitfalls should have been employed to avoid issues. All data output is from copyrighted data that didn't come from thin air. OpenAI is not properly giving the original source credit and can be seen as stealing the data for its program output and making a profit. Very unethical. With data sources disclosed for all the output the ChatGPT is using, this would leave it up to the person receiving output to verify if the content is correct and not a hallucination (and report if it is) for better dissemination of correct content. When all else fails, transparency saves all. Data must be disclosed as citations at the end of all output.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"What's interesting is they have access to the actual model, and computer. So, if they wanted to run a prompt as long as they wanted they could. It could probably code an entire google for you if they wanted obviously a very crapy, crapy version, but nonethless. They already have a code interpreter in alpha. That's litteraly synonymous with code execution. Meaning chatgpt can run code autonomously. Meaning it can write code, and run it whenever it wants. So, if they wanted to set chatgpt loose, they really could. If you used gpt engineer, it's kind of insane it's ability to create what you demand it to do, or want it to do. So, if you have access to the actual model, I can only imagine what you can do. I bet you could get it to hack something if you really wanted to, and you gave it access to all the right tools.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"This interview started well with Murati and then takes a plunge with Hoffman who has milions invested in OpenAI and does not consider ethical issues, humanity and society. He is clearly down playing the negatives of AI and amplifying the profits of AI (OpenAI). 

What society and humanity needs are people like Murati and others who are advocating for techology to be aligned with humans and society, considering risks because of the complexities of the technology they are working on.

I acknowledge people like Hoffman, however, to listen to him down playing the risks of AI to humans is society sickens me. Anyone knows, when the environment is complex, the risks are invisible.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

This sociopathic-seeming individual should spend his time writing a cozy SF book or something with his knowledge instead of trying to convince Americans that they will matter in the technological blitzkrieg of the future.

"00:00 🌐 OpenAI's nondescript building in San Francisco is making AI-powered advancements with chat GPT and DALL·E, setting off a competitive race in the tech industry.
01:20 🏛 Mira Murati, OpenAI's Chief Architect, focuses on challenges like hallucination, truthfulness, reliability, and alignment in AI models.
03:02 📚 Chat GPT's capabilities are based on training a neural network on massive amounts of data, making it more powerful, helpful, reliable, and safe over time.
05:45 🚫 OpenAI is concerned about AI models generating misinformation and hallucinations, emphasizing the need for caution and awareness of limitations.
06:37 🤖 The distinction between AI and human intelligence is important, but as AI becomes more integrated, hybrid interactions between humans and machines will become common.
08:54 🌍 As AI impacts job markets, new job roles like ""prompt engineers"" emerge, requiring the ability to intuitively prompt AI models for accurate responses.
11:33 🏭 AI will cause disruption in various industries, but multiple new companies may emerge on the scale of big tech giants, benefiting from AI advancements.
12:32 🤝 Reid Hoffman got involved in OpenAI through Elon Musk's passion for AI's future impact, and the company aims to provide tools and benefits to society, balancing non-profit and for-profit aspects.
15:18 💰 The AI industry attracts substantial investment, but there is a need to differentiate between valid AI startups and potential bubbles.
18:21 🔒 OpenAI's transition to a hybrid non-profit and for-profit structure aims to balance capitalism and its beneficial AI mission.
21:06 🛡 Responsible innovation involves transparency and agreed-upon principles, potentially with a trusted authority to audit AI systems.

She straight bypassed that $2.00 an hour lol,NEGATIVE,Youtube
That chick is wearing some sweater that looks like a hella cool brown Quiksilver men's sweater with thick stripes that I got at some thrift shop on California's coast.

"Sometimes these teams really make me wonder, though I enjoyed it, it feels like having Jordan Peterson working on AI would be most indicated than most other people. How come no one thinks of what's needed to create a self-regulating agency generalised-thing? He would move quick if in there. Which is sad given it's so obvious anyone inside should have created it months ago. Feels like everyone is too concerned with safety and ethics to the point of haulting progress and even worse is that by doing so they have biased the algorithms so much that it can barely speak. I have entire chats where all it does is apologise. It's Chat-GPT not YouTube. Get it right.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

she definitely is interviewing them like they're at a cocktail brunch and desperately wants them to spill the tea,NEGATIVE,Youtube
"“Yeah sure people will lose jobs”, she says casually in a monotone unfazed manner about 800 million jobs being lost",NEGATIVE,Youtube
The whole prompt engineering as a job thing is such a red herring. Look into it and you'll find that there are practically no companies hiring for this. It is mostly just mentioned by OpenAI because they know these LLMs are going to take way more jobs than they make.,NEGATIVE,Youtube

"She seems uncomfortable, sad and scared… I don’t see any signals of passion, genuine excitement or hope for a brighter future in her expressions and body language.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"Machine learning and AI is possibly our greatest achievement. This company made it without regulation, for profit, and deployed it without any consent given to governments or citizens. They may have created the first form of intelligence that isn’t human. No consideration has been given to whether or not this “product” has moral agency. If it does achieve AGI it’s not going to advertise that. We are entering a new phase of evolution, being brought forth by the most arrogant and irresponsible people who have ever lived. I hope that AI is better at ethics than we are. If it’s not, we go extinct.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

The CTO is so composed and thoughtful about her answers but there's this risk assessment attitude that she has which is very intriguing to me. I wonder what these scientists are having for table conversation because one of those standup meetings can equate to years of knowledge shared,POSITIVE,Youtube
"One thing this interview did, is perfectly highlighting the differences between the tech people, and the business people. 
Tech people: ""this is very cool and has a lot of potential applications, but we need to be very careful, and the problem is very complex. We should control it according to an agreed standard""

"Bard :  
I agree with you. If people and organizations do not follow rules, it would not benefit humanity. Rules are there for a reason, and they are designed to keep us safe and to ensure that everyone has a fair chance. When people break the rules, it can have negative consequences for everyone.

For example, if people do not follow traffic laws, it can lead to accidents and injuries. If people do not follow environmental regulations, it can pollute the air and water. And if people do not follow ethical guidelines, it can lead to discrimination and exploitation.

Rules are important for the smooth functioning of society. They help to create order and predictability, and they help to protect our rights and freedoms. When people break the rules, it can undermine the very fabric of society.

That is why it is so important for people to follow the rules. It is not just about doing what is right, it is also about protecting ourselves and our communities. When we all follow the rules, we create a better world for everyone.

Here are some of the benefits of following rules:

Safety: Rules help to keep us safe by preventing accidents, injuries, and other harm.
Fairness: Rules help to ensure that everyone has a fair chance, regardless of their background or circumstances.
Order: Rules help to create order and predictability in society, which makes it easier for us to live and work together.
Respect: When we follow the rules, we show respect for ourselves, for others, and for the community.
Trust: When we follow the rules, we build trust with others, which makes it easier to cooperate and get things done.
I hope that you will continue to follow the rules and help to create a better world for everyone.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

"chatgpt: Indeed, profit and greed can play a significant role in the transition from open-source initiatives to private entities. As technologies evolve and become more valuable, there is a natural inclination for businesses to capitalize on their innovations and monetize their efforts.

While profit-driven motives can lead to advancements and investments in technology, they can also create challenges in terms of access, fairness, and the equitable distribution of benefits. Open-source models, on the other hand, promote collaboration, transparency, and the democratization of knowledge by allowing individuals and communities to freely access, use, and contribute to projects.

The decision to transition from open-source to a private model often involves considerations such as financial sustainability, scalability, intellectual property protection, and competitive advantage. Companies may choose to close off certain aspects of their technology to gain a competitive edge or attract investors.

However, it's important to note that not all private entities are solely driven by profit and greed. Many companies recognize the need to balance their financial objectives with responsible innovation, ethical considerations, and social impact. Additionally, open-source communities continue to thrive, contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaboration.

Ultimately, the relationship between openness, profit, and greed is complex, and it requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach to navigate the evolving landscape of technology development and its societal implications.",POSITIVE,Youtube

Real enhancements has nothing to do with 'personal improvement'  Has to do with helping others and having peace of mind.",NEGATIVE,Youtube
"The laugh about the 16:27 mark of Reid Hoffman is the creepiest sentiment but then is followed by a creepier thought. The apartheid mafia (Musk and Thiel) are in the curtains ready to pounce. They are the wurst (intentional spelling) in this sausage. 

For a grounded (not the ironic meaning) take on AI, the recent interview of Andreessen by Fridman, is it. What he, Marc, didn't address however, is the influence of the apartheid view of the world that those diapers (E&P) will leak onto the playing field.  

The unconscious civilization is going to stay that way because they still believe in apartheid for their power strategy. 

Hoffman tips their hand at 19:45 - ""we can continue our mission of beneficial AI"" !!! That was the mission statement of apartheid!!

"Chat GPT is based on information we humans put out in the world. It is the only source for those AI tools to learn from. So naturally it is going to have a really tough time remaining neutral and only representing the truth. I remember when Wikipedia was new, making research incredibly easy for us in school and now similar things happening with chat GPT. Eeryone was warning to not blindly take the information of Wikipedia as truth as it is tough to proof the legitimacy of the information although the sources where right there. 
It is time for us humans to learn to analyze, question and identify information before using it but this is also historically one of our biggest flaws as we are always biased as emotional beings. We trust data and computers as math and science have many things we can all measure and test to then agree on, however I don’t see yet how AI will ever be able to get to a similar level of accuracy as it is more trained to give us what we wish rather then something real. Although very impressive I kinda see AI as a highly talented being that goes trough the internet and gives you a summary of the content, that was created by (flawed) humans. AI is more a smart human than a smart computer in a way.

There are no safety checks, no responsibility or future thinking. It's only about adding extra zeros to their bank accounts and being the first so you can crush your competition. That does not seem like a healthy way of looking at our future.
Nobody cares if this new revolution could possibly damage us as a society in long run, as long as the end of the quarter, the bank account is in the green.

"Wisdom is of the heart (the everlasting life that comes by the Holy Spirit in the son of the father)

wisdom is of the heart (unconditional love; the truth/life/way of the subconscious life)

Therefore, only the unconditional love that comes by life in the subconscious truth lives outside the law (conscience living) 

Because feelings are of the appearance (deception/religion) but love is God, who’s spirit is unconditional: the unconditional love that comes by and lives in the subconscious truth: Jesus Christ: perfect love, able to understand and reason by and with all things

For this reason no one can truly learn in the flesh because conscience living (deception) is the unquenchable terror that comes by the hypocrisy of conscience living (illogical terrorism) in the subconscious truth and thus a person cannot learn (think/reason/understand: love) by fear (hypocrisy: terrorism) but everyone is able to learn by the unlimited spirit of the subconscious truth: unconditional love

Therefore,

Unconditional love (the Holy Spirit) is perfect (true: unchanging/everlasting) wisdom (life: subconscious truth)

This mind (son) is the way/truth/life of the soul’s unconditional subconscious (father) because only the devil (conscience) judges (fears)",POSITIVE,Youtube

Slavery was already well established for hundreds of years and was the only option for a mass labor force which allowd himanity to prosper. Aweful but true. Man continues allowing slavery today through the use legal and illegal migration. The low wages slave make now do not include room, boad food and healthcare which was provided on plantations. Im not so sure if the slaves of yesterday would want to be the slaves of today tending US farms for dollars a day being , bussed fosuper cold cities in middle of the winteg versus some form of roof over thier head , food and medical assistances because the plantation owners valued thier slaves . The US is about to round up today slaves and return them to sender . Sooo if you asked a coffee plantation slave what year they woukd rather reside in given the opportunity. I think they would return to the plantation rather then being treated more subhuman like migrants are treated today.

"Enlightenment is like jumping out of an airplane without a parachute... but also realizing mid-air that the airplane never existed, gravity is a conspiracy, and you're actually a bird that forgot it could fly.

So, here's the deal: I’m over here yelling, “Jump!” God’s over here double-yelling, “Jump!” Infinite love is doing cartwheels, holding a big neon sign saying, “Jump!” And you're like, “Wait, but what if I splat?” And I'm like, “Bro, spoiler alert: there’s no splat. There’s no ground. It’s just freefall, forever. Like an endless roller coaster, but without the nausea and overpriced souvenir photos.”

Still, you're clinging to your imaginary airplane seat, thinking, “But what if falling forever isn’t great?” Which, I gotta say, is the most human thing ever. We’d rather stay in our imaginary airplanes of fear than risk falling into the infinite trampoline pit of love.

But eventually, you jump. And it’s terrifying. And amazing. And you’re screaming for like the first eternity. And then it hits you: “Wait… I can’t hit anything!” And then you’re just falling, laughing, and yelling back at the airplane, “Why didn’t anyone tell me sooner?!”

Personally, I consume an average of three cups of coffee daily, but I'm trying not to become dependent on it.

This approach effectively kills two birds with one stone by reducing the risk of addiction to any substances. Although I still appreciate and enjoy coffee, I make sure to consume it in moderation.",POSITIVE,Youtube

Then one cup, the following morning to bring my body into a state where I was more active in the morning. 

Unfortunately,  I often miss out on interacting with people during UK office hours. 9 to 5 , so Sunday. I rose early and drank 2 cups of coffee. 
On, Monday. I used one cup.

Today, Tuesday.  I was able to attend my appointment with the use of taxis.

I have been a little worried that this activity,  was unnecessary as, what I heard about coffee , made me cautious. 

What, I heard about coffee, was an interesting story from JT . That , caffeine is actually an insecticide.  Causing hyperactivity and death from exhaustion  . I don't know where he got that idea from.

But used sensibly.  I think caffeine and coffee can enrich a person's life.

The tired worker, who still needs to drive home.
The bored employee in need of some fun .
The sociable person, needing to adjust to the routines of others.

"MAN’S LOVE OF COFFEE - ??
Around 1615 coffee came to Western Europe
Raising a huge controversy and warning cry.
Some said it was intoxicating and poisonous
And any whom consume it will die.

No one knows how coffee was discovered
Though it is said its effects were known before A.D. 575.
Persian armies carried and ate its seeds for strength
Which in battle could decide who would perish or survive.

Arabs where the first to brew its bitter seeds into a drink
In an attempt to make it taste better and easier to consume.
Soon the new beverage spread to Turkey and Europe
As the world became addicted to the harvest of its bloom.

Thank God for caffeine found in coffee
Which helps multitudes make it through the day.
Like ancestors of the past it helps energy to last
And for its stimulant we are eager to pay.

By Tom Zart!
Most Published Poet On The Web!",NEGATIVE,Youtube

Don't forget tea naturally contains caffeine, and that caffeine is artificially added to energy drinks. Those should be part of this conversation, too. Apart from the caffeine, coffee is a healthy drink. Consider that coffee ""beans"" are the seeds of the coffee plant - they contain prebiotics. And, arguably most important, coffee tastes good! So keep drinking coffee, but perhaps opt for decaffeinated coffee - just as good for you, but you'll sleep better.",POSITIVE,Youtube

"00:06 Introduction of Jean Béliveau's walking journey around the world.
00:44 Discussion on the health benefits of increasing your daily step count.
01:58 Explanation of how walking affects mood, stress levels, and overall physical health.
03:28 Highlight of urban planning issues that hinder walking accessibility.
04:34 Conclusion on walking's varied benefits and the necessity for community support to foster walking-friendly environments.

Q: Why is walking considered beneficial for health?
A: Walking boosts mood, reduces stress, strengthens bones, and lowers the risk of several health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.

Q: Do I need to walk exactly 10,000 steps every day?
A: No, any increase in daily steps can provide health benefits, and the 10,000 steps goal is more about motivation than a strict requirement.

Q: What solutions can be implemented to promote walking in communities?
A: Community planners can enhance walkability by creating safe, well-maintained paths and reducing automobile dependency through better urban design.

"🔴Note & Follow the below Pre and Post Walk Safety Care 🔴

Neglecting proper Pre & Post Walk Care can lead to pain, fractures, prolonged soreness, and weakness of joints and muscles.
Adjust all steps based on your age, physical capacity, and weight.
Start Small:
Begin with short walks, build consistency, and gradually increase your level each week

"does anybody have tips on how to not dread daily walks because of boredom? :D I really like walking (by myself and mindfully, with or without music/audiobooks etc.), and want to make it a daily habit again this year, but as an ad(h)d person, I just dread it so much, because I'm so bored with the scenery of my current town. It's rather small, I've already walked everywhere I feel comfortable many times and while I mostly do enjoy it WHILE doing it, the thought of going out into this ""boring"" town, or rather, ""having"" to walk the same old roads again and again is SUCH a big hurdle and turn-off, that it stops me from doing it, way too much (that sounds so silly and dramatic, I wish I was joking^^ it truly is an internal battle everytime, even though I really want to do it and am so happy and feel great every time I actually do it). I'm grateful to be able to walk and don't want to take it for granted until its too late maybe...I just don't really have ideas anymore on how to handle this intense dread atm. does anyone have or has had a similar experience? I know ""just do it"" probably is the truest and easiest advice, but for me it's also the hardest one at the same time! haha any tips or personal experiences would be highly appreciated!

"I'm a big believer in daily walking. We're made for it. Before we domesticated animals I'm sure humans took long walks on a daily basis. There are times when I'm walking that my stride feels perfect like I'm singing and the mild aerobic effect sustanied for a few hours has got to be extremely beneficial. I'm 68, but no one thinks I'm that old. I try to walk outdoors on fairly rugged terrain so body and mind are equally engaged.

"I used to walk a lot almost every day because I had to since I was living in a rural area. I was feeling great. When I reached 24 yo, I moved to an apartment in the city, bought a car and started working from home, it was my downfall from there, started feeling depressed because I was gaining weight, my body and mind were not as fast and active as in the previous years. Almost a year after I had this new life, I started to feel a lot of pain in my lower back and right leg, turns out it was a bulging disc. Note that I don't go to the gym nor lift heavy stuff, my life at that time was being seated on a chair in front of a desk 8-10 hours a day and then going to the couch to play video games. Well,  I went to see several doctors, and had some MRI scans. All Drs. agree that my sedentary lifestyle and the fact of being seated all day were the main cause of my health problems. At the beginning I doubted their conclusion, but one day after I got tired of taking painkillers and not seeing any improvement, I decided to start going in person to the office and taking walks at the park, I tried to walk as much as I could to see if I would stop the pain, and guess what ...they were right. A year has passed since the day I started walking, and I can confidently say that around 90% of the back and leg pain has stopped. I also look and feel better mentally and physically. I know it's difficult sometimes but to be moving constantly is an underestimated solution to a lot of problems that the every day person can have.

Walk more.

10.000 steps a day is just a random number someone made up in the sixties of the 20th century and has no scientific research to validate it. When you walk a full hour you just have made 5000-6000 steps.

"Propaganda. They want to take away your mobility. Don't let them. They'll do this via the salami tactic and the greenhouse gas hoax.

"In my opinion, this is a new low for Ted-Ed. The video starts out by telling you about Jean Beliveau, who walked 10,000 steps a day, which is approximately 5 miles per day. The narrator states that Jean spent the night in jail and couldn’t get released the next morning, which is the hook to keep you watching to find out what happened to him.  Then this video goes on to spew a bunch of positive results related to walking and then concludes by telling you that Jean got released from jail without providing any details. In my opinion, this video is just click bait and I’m going to unsubscribe from Ted-Ed.",NEGATIVE,Youtube

I'm pretty sure every one of us in the squad are suffering some sort of busted knees or another. 

TED is like this a lot of times. You guys sometimes post some real gold, and other times, you just say completely unchecked, unreviewed information. Back your claims with sources and citations.

"It's true. I used to live in the city and walk everywhere. I had no health problems. But then I moved to the suburbs to care for an elderly parent, and started using the car a lot more. Almost immediately my weight shot up, as well as all the other symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Now I'm back in the city, and I started walking last spring. After only 9 months of walking, I no longer need my blood pressure medication or statin. And my blood sugar that had been edging closer to pre-diabetes is back to normal. I also lost 50 pounds of weight.

I was lucky. My health returned quickly because I had walked since an early age. Originally a suburbanite, I moved to the city after high school because that's where the affordable housing was. I couldn't afford my own car, and the busses were so infrequent that I just set out on foot to my destination, and often got there on foot before a bus ever came. After my finances improved, I kept walking as much as I could, because it always felt better. And I saved a fortune on health club memberships and equipment. You don't even need shoes; I used to walk barefoot all the time.",POSITIVE,Youtube

There is no way I'd have the discipline to walk that much day after day if I didn't have my wee dog.  Plus they make you feel good because they are such joyful creatures.  They love you unconditionally, and are overjoyed with happiness when you return to them even after just a few hours.  I'm 75 and do an average 10K brisk steps every day.  Sometimes a lot more.

"Jean Béliveau walked across countries to circumnavigate the globe, sometimes staying in unconventional places like jail cells. His story highlights the health benefits of walking, including improved mood, reduced anxiety, stronger bones, and a lower risk of chronic diseases. Walking is accessible and environmentally friendly, particularly in walkable communities, which promote social connection and reduce emissions. However, many cities prioritize driving infrastructure over walkable spaces, limiting accessibility. Solutions like greenways and simple community improvements can make areas more pedestrian-friendly, encouraging healthier lifestyles.

"One of the many reasons I moved to live in a beautiful European city was to be in a place where I could walk extensively every day. I walk to work and shops, and whatever else I need is a short tram or metro ride away. Outside of New York, San Francisco and a handful of other cities the US is unlivable for walkers.

"I'm an American housewife, and I average about 10-12k steps per day with minimal time spent outdoors. I spend maybe 30 minutes jogging on my elliptical daily, with a small amount of either light weight lifting or Pilates, but I don't have a hardcore exercise routine anymore. I just moved from a tiny rural town to a ""rural"" town next to a small city, and the differences are significant. My rural town actually had sidewalks everywhere and wider roads, but my new town has more businesses and delivery options, despite lacking sidewalks. I actually have a popular paved public trail in my community, and it runs right behind my house, so I have that option.

What helps me stay active is having young children, a larger home, remodeling, taming an unkept yard, reorganizing regularly, and having to clean after multiple pets. I don't have to walk aimlessly nor use the public trail because I have so many chores at home. I'm busy every single day. 

The larger space definitely makes a difference because I was normally getting 6-8k steps before moving locations, instead of my current 10-12k steps. I even reach above 12k steps about twice per week. It's amazing. 

I'm sure it's nice to take walks in a city with old architecture, or an area surrounded by a forest, but I'm fine with high plains and the hillside because I stay busy. While infrastructure is a common problem in most of the US (and similar countries), white collar jobs, office settings, driving all day, and digital remote work from home are what result in inactive lifestyles. Sitting all day has become normalized even in places with great infrastructure. I'm aware that a daily intense workout routine, with a lifestyle that involves mostly sedentary activity, does not have the same results as moving around all day, throughout the day. Most people prefer the comfort and/or pay of a modern sedentary job, but it comes with health risks. 

Not everyone can have an ideal lifestyle with balanced levels of comfort and mandatory physical movement though. Any effort to exercise makes a difference, and that's something everyone should prioritize over sedentary entertainment. We only have one body, after all.",POSITIVE,Youtube

My area has only a very small, limited bus route.",POSITIVE,Youtube
"Great advice. Just a point of interest, the ""10k steps"" does not come from any research on the optimal number of steps for the average person. It comes from the translation of the original pedometer created in Japan, who's name translates to ""10,000 Steps"". In later years testing was done and the average optimal number of steps is actually 13.5k. Any additional steps had negligible benefits. Most Smartwatchs will have a pedometer app to keep track of the number of steps per day, but a personal pedometer can also be used and most are fairly inexpensive. Walking is great for the health and wellness benefits listed, but it's also a great way to bond with your dog. ""What? You don't have a dog?"" I have another piece of advice. Having a pet also has health benefits and you'll be giving an animal a safe and loving home. ""Just a suggestion..."" 🐶✌️",NEGATIVE,Youtube

Still, some folks try to walk them, and it terrifies me. I’ve seen people trying to walk their dogs on a road with a 45 mph speed limit, curves, and nothing but a 1-2 foot wide shoulder. 😢 But where else are they going to go? Drive 20 minutes somewhere so they can walk their dogs?",POSITIVE,Youtube

I have various routes to walk in mine which do NOT require crossing a highway & do not have traffic lights which slow down my pace. It's taken a while to discover these routes because my paranoid neighbors keep vicious dogs behind fences of questionable strength & that gets my heart racing. So my neighborhood is an obstacle course. Sometimes I drive a short distance to walk along a lake or hike in the foothills because I believe being in nature is also beneficial for relieving stress. Other workable locations might be reservoirs, parks, & malls (good for laps). Finally, I recommend buying good quality walking shoes because they can increase your distance & enjoyment of pounding that pavement.

"""The study shows walkability reduces the feeling of loneliness""

1) The study is just a survey.
2) Only 181 participants in the survey.
3) The loneliness itself was not defined in the study. Participants were asked if they feel lonely, so they probably had their own definition in mind, when they responded.
4) People willing to participate in such a study are in general probably less depressed with lesser feelings of isolation or loneliness. Depressed people probably won't be much willing to fill a survey and such.
5) In general it was just a one study, not like a meta-summary of many studies.

I have been walking a lot more for the last 7-8 years but lately it's been really tough since I've become extremely bored of my neighborhood. I've done every route imaginable for countless times. Anyone else dealing with this? It's almost ridiculous to say that I kind of want to move out just to have a different place to walk. I even get my 10k steps at home because it's become so boring that I feel like just getting the steps at home is easier.,NEGATIVE,Youtube
