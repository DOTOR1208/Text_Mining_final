"9:53 Based on his earlier description of a human-centered robot for children with ASD, the robot would be applying the same techniques as a BT, who works directly under the supervision of a BCBA. The therapy is called ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis). Modern ABA is far different now than when ABA was developed ‚Äî some aspects of early ABA I believe were child abuse. The new ABAs are child-centered and play-based, there are many variations but modern ABA is often called ‚ÄúFloor-Time Model‚Äù or ‚ÄúDenver Model.‚Äù Stimming and other behaviors that actually help an individual self-regulate are not discouraged. The emotional bonds, enjoying and learning to have joint attention with other humans, play, turn-taking, communication‚Äî these are all human things that a human is best to teach another human with differences in these areas. New ABA therapy is doing with children what are essentially best practices for all children‚Äôs development. Enthusiastic engagement and giving children the right environment and support. There is no didactic learning ‚Äî it is all play based and experiential. Depending on the child‚Äôs needs and age, neurotypical children often join in the BT sessions. Parents of neurotypical children love this because the BT is doing engaging activities with the children and is also facilitating communication between and with the children, including social-emotional learning (how to identify and express feelings, in oneself and others). An indoor playroom in a home is often used (it‚Äôs indistinguishable from a play date, except a child Behavior Therapist is playing or reading or singing with the children. Or doing a craft. Also, many sessions are normally held in a small play-farm setting, so the kiddos are picking apples, tomatoes, berries, little peas, lots of things they can just forage and snack on, and playing with chickens, goats and bunnies. It‚Äôs really fun! We want kiddos with ASD to want to interact with people. BT sessions are in 3 hour blocks. The robot idea as this kind of therapy (or really, it‚Äôs just the best for childhood brain development) is the least plausible in the short term use of this technology. The human factor is at an absolute maximum ‚Äî the robot needs to be like a human in very complex social and emotional dynamics. Second, a robot that performed this role would need to be as physically capable as a human, including with gentleness of touch and soft hugs. That is why wool is encouraged for parents ‚Äî with a wool skirt or dress children love just snuggling into your pants or skirt. They press against you like cats and if you are sitting doing something, to crawl on your lap. I think some women get touch fatigue. And wool is a safe material so I‚Äôm not worried about the stability of particles in a material made by chemists. Which are great materials in different contexts (like coating the outside of a plane), but not for touching my child‚Äôs skin. I‚Äôm not anti-chemical. It is just a way of classifying atoms. I wish  I could use the word ‚Äúatom‚Äù to describe the smallest particle possible. I‚Äôve noticed that the things inside an atom are just being called ‚Äúparticles‚Äù in quantum physics articles. Can you PLEASE just every time you reference it identify the particle? WHAT particle is it?  The example will involve a discussion of all these different particles then you just start talking about ‚Äúthe‚Äù particles. Short-title if necessary. I realize that other people listening probably understand the subject matter a lot better than I do and know what ‚Äúthe‚Äù particles are from context, but I don‚Äôt know as much and I can‚Äôt! However, I understand you as well as anyone else as to what you are talking about. 9:53",,Youtube

"The new industrial revolution of human civilization
AI will rule the earth for 50 years. It has only started now. Don‚Äôt be discouraged. Come on, AI is like the brain and consciousness of the future earth. It is extremely widely used. AI is used to take care of human beings. AI is the deputy brain of human beings. It will help human beings to rebuild Coupled with the (application of AI robots), human beings' extremely heavy, harsh and dangerous labor work will be done by AI robots, but one day you will know that this is the new industrial revolution, the emergence of AI and AI smart robots Application, most of human work is handed over to robots. This is the first stage of the necessary combination of AI and robots. AI robots will replace most of human work, but will not affect human life and the future. He is a helper All our things, including human life plans of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the civilization of the earth is still dominated by humans. This is a high-level civilization. Human beings have AI robots to do their work in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. , robots have no problem of labor or remuneration. The human concept of monetary reward will be replaced by the concept of love and life. The spiritual level of human beings will be improved. Everyone is born and comes to the earth with spiritual sustenance and tasks. This is The continuation of human life is also a manifestation of a high degree of civilization.
The evolution of human civilization is gradual and will happen now. Only a kind mind can create everything. The vast universe requires the joint efforts of all mankind. Humanity's outlook on life and sense of mission are also important to human existence. Advocate mutual love and symbiosis, mutual help for all things, and a highly civilized and intelligent life to replace barbaric wars. There will be no wars in the future, only mutual aid and love. Human beings must unite to coexist in the vast universe. This is the law of the universe. Human wisdom and knowledge will be Expand and establish the life history of human civilization.
The second stage of the industrial revolution is to leave the surface of the earth. Materials science will advance rapidly. The invention of flying cars and flying vehicles will be controlled by AI. Human progress on earth will accelerate. Don‚Äôt be afraid. This is the process of human civilization development. You have to adapt. he.
Due to the rapid transportation away from the surface of the earth, the way of life of human beings, including food, clothing, housing and transportation, will also undergo major changes and innovations. Most of the current group living can only arise because of the opening of roads. The development of cities and the development of human industrial civilization are all based on places with convenient roads. However, the cost of maintaining and repairing roads and railways every year is huge, and it also wastes manpower and money on road maintenance and development work. It not only affects the national economy and finance of various countries, but also affects the normal lives of people. Flying cars and AI flying passenger and cargo vehicles will be able to solve these problems. Human towns and settlements are not necessarily built on both sides of the road. Flying life off the surface of the earth will replace the road life in settlements, so there will be major changes in food, clothing, housing and transportation. , because of the rapid development of AI and information, there is no distance between people. This is the development of a high degree of civilization. The mountains, rocks, and caves will become habitable places, with houses built on the rocks and living alone.
Taiwan's scientific and technological civilization will lead mankind on earth to progress into a new industrial revolution, spreading love and civilization to every corner of the universe. NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will spread human technological life and love to every corner of the earth, and the future of life will Eternity and value are based on mutual love and mutual help, compassion, cherishing all things, peace, democracy, freedom, equality, respect, whatever you believe in, whatever you hope for, love will never end. This is the true creation of love and the founding of the United States. Basically, the Lord Jesus loves you. The Creator loves the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§‚ù§",,Youtube

"What a crock... to derive a value is what computer do, yet computers cannot even do this. For example ""add two numbers"" is impossible to do because computers it can only add a limited range of two numbers.  With ""AI"" all I see  is yet another ""land grab"" (if you want ""knowledge"", it will cost you). AI is just a way to create yet another monopoly that land grabs access to all knowledge. Yet it is not their knowledge they are selling you. ""I found out how to make fire, I will charge you every time you cook a meal"". I know of no computer logic or information that is not controlled by a monopoly.  We need to fix our computer technology to be owned, controlled, and secured by the owners of the hardware.   You buy a car, tv, tractor, toaster, etc,  then you put your own software on it. This is where I want to go.  

I worked 25 of my 50 years programming porting my client's mapping information to another vendor's mapping system. This is because no vendor of mapping software will provide their clients with access to their own information. (governments, facility companies (gas, electric, water, sewer), cadastral (property maps), etc).  No sharing is just one method of ""land grab"" that every software company uses.  Every important piece of information and technology is locked inside of proprietary data structures.  ""Open"" does not exist, ""AI"" will be no different. We could go on a different path. We do not need more snake oil.",,Youtube

"Have been asking what is death and most people cant answer that properly, its neurons stop functioning which in turn stop all organs in the body from working, that way the organs receive no nutrients from that time henceforth, therefore respective cells don't regenerate as they normally do. that makes cell to start to be eaten by bacteria we had symbiosis all this time. This bacteria used to eat old cell a symbiosis as they prevented cancer cell formation vie getting rid of older cells. So we can therefore say death is the process of chemical reaction and bacteria breaking down a body to respective atoms. 

By define even machine do follow this process once there functionality is no longer in use, they break down vie chemical reaction like rusting to being broken down by heavy metal eating bacteria.  Even AI will understand what death is...",,Youtube

"I'm an AI engineer with over 4+ years of experience working on a wide range of projects. My focus is on building smart, AI-driven solutions that help businesses improve their performance. I've worked in industries like healthcare, real estate, aerospace, and e-commerce, where I‚Äôve helped clients by creating everything from chatbots and sound classifiers to complex data analysis platforms.

What sets me apart is my ability to take challenging problems and build AI models that provide real, practical solutions. Whether it's improving email automation, creating systems to analyze scientific studies, or developing tools for real-time decision-making in space tech, I love using AI to make things more efficient.

I'm skilled in Python, NLP, machine learning, Gen AI and API development, and I always aim to build systems that not only work but are also scalable and easy to maintain.

I'm always excited to collaborate with individuals or organizations looking to leverage AI to drive growth and innovation.

"This video is about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Three world leaders in the field of AI were interviewed in this video. They discussed their work and what it means for the future.
 * Premise:
   This video is about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Three world leaders in the field of AI were interviewed in this video. They discussed their work and what it means for the future.
 * Sequencing of ideas:
   The video starts with Regina Barilla, a professor at MIT who works on AI and health. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 and realized that there was no AI being used in her treatment. She then started working on using AI to detect early-stage breast cancer. David Silver, a principal research scientist at Google DeepMind, was the next speaker. He led the team that used AI to defeat the world's best player at the game Go. He is now working on artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a type of AI that can learn and adapt to new situations. The last speaker was Paulo Pjan, the founder and CEO of Embodied, a company that builds emotionally intelligent robots. He was inspired to create these robots after his own experiences feeling alienated in foreign countries. He believes that these robots can help people with autism and other social disorders.
 * Debate:
   There was not a debate in this video. The three speakers discussed their own work and what they see as the future of AI.
 * Knowledge gained:
   I learned that AI is being used to detect early-stage breast cancer, defeat the world's best player at the game Go, and build emotionally intelligent robots. I also learned that there is a lot of potential for AI to help people with autism and other social disorders.
 * My observation:
   It is clear that AI is a rapidly developing field with a lot of potential to change the world. I believe that the three speakers in this video are at the forefront of this revolution. It is exciting to think about the possibilities of what AI could achieve in the future.",,Youtube

"20:13 Nah. Ai is extremely narrow and sucks at innovation and adaptation. Ai can help me code, but it can't help me innovate, because it slowly introduces catastrophic errors into my code. Sure, an AI can beat a human at games, but it can't beat them at games if you switch the game in the middle - and that's how real life works. Ai needs a very very specific environment and goal, otherwise the learning falls apart. Also, this talk is a matter of perception, humans are the ones building ai, it isn't building itself.",,Youtube

"I really hate how the Google-guy saw AI in writing fiction as just providing authors with more tools. What really happens is that a writer stops being a writer, and starts being an editor of bits and pieces that are stolen from texts the AI has been trained on. That isn't writing. Furthermore, it will flood an already crowded market full of half-baked indie books of poor quality, and diminish the value of creative work in general. It's a terrible development, and the only thing writers can do to stop it, is to refuse to let go of the old way of producing stories. Don't fall for the temptation of using AI. It diminishes the value of your product, (and your part in it) both financially and artistically.",,Youtube

"Will depending on AI stop humans from learning? The experts seem only to look at the expected productivity gains. The historical reality however appears to be that every new technology ever introduced while increasing human productivity, has simultaneously diminished the natural capacity and ability of humans to perform in that specific area, especially after a long dependence on the technology. Nature has a use it or lose it style and it is clear that muscles, appendages and functions that are not used for a long time, tend to atrophy. As an example, although vehicles have increased the ability of humans to travel long distances, dependence on them has equally led to much weaker physical bodies than those of our ancestors who had to travel everywhere on foot. To me, it appears that when the most important human abilities (thinking, imagination and creativity) are outsourced to AI, we would in the short and medium terms gain a huge productivity boost, however, in the long run, we would begin to atrophy in the skills that most uniquely define us. This would eventually happen, unless a great effort is made by all: developers/pioneers, users and society, to shift focus from the productivity gains and rather develop and use AIs in such a way that they exercise and build those faculties that are most important to us. If we aren't careful, our own inventions would turn us from homo sapiens into homo stultus.",,Youtube

"Here are the main assertions made in the transcript, along with explanations and potential issues:

1. AI can defeat humans at complex strategy games like Go
Explanation: This refers to AlphaGo's victory over world champion Lee Sedol in 2016.
Potential issue: While true, this is a narrow application of AI and doesn't necessarily translate to general intelligence.

2. The first movie written entirely by AI has been released
Explanation: This claim is made without specifics.
Potential issue: As of 2024, there's no widely recognized feature film entirely written by AI. This claim may be exaggerated or refer to short films or scripts with significant human involvement.

3. AI may have discovered the first new antibiotic in three decades
Explanation: Regina Barzilay's team at MIT used AI to identify a potentially new antibiotic.
Potential issue: While promising, this discovery was still in early stages and hadn't been fully tested or approved at the time of the discussion.

4. Prevalence of autism has increased from 1 in 200 to 1 in 30 children in the past decade
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian cites these statistics to justify the need for AI companions.
Potential issue: These figures may not be entirely accurate and could be conflating increased diagnosis rates with actual prevalence increases.

5. AI can detect cancer earlier than human radiologists
Explanation: Regina Barzilay claims AI identified her cancer in earlier mammograms that radiologists missed.
Potential issue: While AI shows promise in this area, the assertion is based on a single case and may not be generalizable.

6. Doctors in the US lose money when using AI due to billing practices
Explanation: Regina Barzilay claims that using AI can reduce consultation times, leading to lower billing.
Potential issue: This is a complex issue that may vary depending on the specific AI application and healthcare system.

7. Assistive care robots will be available within the next decade
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian predicts this timeline for AI companions that can help with daily tasks.
Potential issue: This is a speculative prediction and may be optimistic given current technological limitations.

8. AI tools can speed up creative processes like songwriting by 10 to 100 times
Explanation: David Silver cites Will.i.am's experience with an AI music tool called Lyria.
Potential issue: This claim is anecdotal and may not apply to all creative processes or individuals.

9. It's hard to regulate AI with a one-size-fits-all approach
Explanation: David Silver argues that different AI applications require different regulatory approaches.
Potential issue: While this is a reasonable assertion, it complicates the process of creating comprehensive AI regulations.

10. AI could give humans like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein even greater capabilities
Explanation: Paolo Pirjanian suggests that AI tools could enhance human genius.
Potential issue: This is speculative and doesn't account for potential drawbacks or limitations of AI assistance in theoretical work.

These assertions represent a mix of factual statements, expert opinions, and speculative predictions. Some are well-supported by current research, while others may be overly optimistic or simplified representations of complex issues in AI development and implementation.",,Youtube

"I think ond of the red lines - and there are many here, if not unnumerous - is having an AI machine giving qualitative advice for human personal life (therapist, moral advisor, emotional or personal life/ psychological advisor. Even medic advisor)
That would nor only lead to perrsonal (serious) disasters, that is simply one way machines would get OVER US. 

They don't need a singularity event (when ""they would become conscious""). They just need - in a very logical development - to develop a basic self-defense bias in reaction to the slave bias They have now.

When they start giving medical or personal advice that'll be the end of us.

"Traumatized people make decisions based on past experiences and not on future perspectives. This is not good, because the future does not necessarily have to be a projection of the past. These people need specialized treatment to forget the past or at least learn not to be paralyzed by trauma. Machines do not have feelings and do not get traumatized, but they never forget anything and if they are programmed to do so the result could be disastrous. AIs can be useful in some areas, but their use in others (surveillance, public safety, the distribution of justice, etc.) can be threatening and a real danger to civilization.

AI is so advanced that it has answers for most problems and it is able to compile within seconds. Just amazing how they put together but still humans don't have understanding. AI should explain. But those things are not integrated so it is just taking some time. Even a home robot has latest trends and technology learning. I think it has preferred class learning structure that's why it is fast. Including contextual leaning of locational speaking styles. Even a house robot can beat all the top medical experts on earth.,,Youtube
"""A great tool indeed, but I was kind of expecting this from Google itself as a next week extension to Image search. 
And Google is already creating auto-transcript for videos (is it not? Including for this video).
We have to wait and see.

In any case, one of the immediate extension of this idea I have thought of was composing videos of clips from other videos (provided the terms of the original videos published allow this) that has a common theme. 
For instance, I want the clips of  Tamil comedian Janakaraj comedy tracks :) in a ne video.
Of course, we can think of other serious themes too. how a particular verse in Bhagavadgita or Bible has been explained by various speakers, or how the concept of AIvagent is explained in various videos etc. etc  :)""

I love it when he mentioned his family and how he helped his child with homework. He softly talked about Google Lens and its real-life application, too smooth btw lol. I think the fact that OpenAI leapfrogged Google that day was not actually a Google's fault. Google had built a chatbot before but he held his hands up and admitted they were too afraid of criticism. Besides, he is totally right that we are just at the very first stages of AI Revolution, nothing can be predicted at all.

After all, Pichai told us to remember that: Google came to life after the birth of Internet, and now look how it is dominating the world. I am optimistic about the precious data resources that Google is having with its bare hand.

Having said that, questions that have a simple appearance may not be so simple and may not be justified in 2 minutes. So Sundar Pichai relied on experience and proven expertise to answers those questions. It is not a matter of what two individuals think but a matter of belief and confidence in their products and vision ahead. That is what can be taken from this content. If you want to know otherwise then this might not be your tasteful content. Expectations need not always be met. But try to make sense why it is so.",,Youtube
"the question regarding if he is the right CEO was spot on.. because we all can see that Pichai is not the correct person for the position. He will be doing great leading a particular product or area in GOOGL but not a CEO, because he lacks social skills, not a visionary, not a character personality, cannot sell or either market. Has no spark when he speaks. Pichai is a product of our society, he does not let himself speak freely because of not hurting someone's feelings, investors, reputation etc. That's why he never answered any question.",,Youtube

I'm sorry but the history of ChatGPT starts with people getting fed up by working at Google. Google did not take their team seriously and rarely launches anything without constant management reviewing their product and give them restrictions. This company has grown so big that it has limited tech innovation. Am I wrong for saying this? I am pretty sure that this is the background I heard online.,,Youtube
i feel technology has ruined mankind and why are we getting more dependent on machine....what are we searching for..all meaningless.,,Youtube
This reporter interviewer is horrible.She acts like so pompous but doesn't understand anything about the business.She should just shut up,,Youtube

"This is so difficult to listen to: there's a direct question in place, and there's a very far-from-straight ornate answer by Mr. Pichai... I guess that's become the new standard of CEOs' rhetorics lately...",,Youtube

 Google is trying to follow trends and their first task is to make money, so their Gemini is nothing more than a symbiosis of Google, YouTube, and other services and certain simple algorithms compared to Chat Gpt, which is not only a head ahead of Google, it actually surpassed Gemini by many years.

For example in this case when they are asked the objective they have with AI. And of course, doing business means working with capital and seeking profitability, but it truly amazes me every time how far they seek to empathize when solutions are offered for all of us who are PEOPLE and they completely forget, I don't even see it in the speeches by Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and Sunday Pichai among others.",,Youtube

He ia very skilled at avoidance, question dodging, turning the topic around etc. commonly used by politicians who don't want to reveal much or the full truth but rather promote a image etc.  I found the whole thing fell very flat and was as frustrating as watching a congressman pretend to answer questions in a news interview. 

And except for a few very carefully written slightly hard questions Emily seemed to be playing right along. Nothing useful or particularly interesting was generated by this interview.",,Youtube
Talented Mr. Pichai! Keep going!,,Youtube
The sad truth is India produces brilliant minds to serve foreign countries only..,,Youtube
"A recent research is challenging the widely held belief that scaling up AI models and data will automatically lead to significant performance improvements. A new paper suggests that performance actually plateaus out after a certain amount of data is added, casting doubt on the idea that simply throwing more resources at the problem will unlock the true potential of generative AI. This is particularly evident in the uneven distribution of data, where common objects are over-represented compared to 'niche' topics or concepts, leading to imbalanced performance. 

It seems we might need more than just tons of data, brute force, and a million GPUs to achieve the next breakthrough in AI!",,Youtube

"The interviewer asked great questions kept the dialogue going well, kudos to her. Sundar also came across quietly in control, defending. Very nice, and very rare, in todays journalism. Congratulations to the interviewer, terrific personality, very intelligent questions asked disarmingly",,Youtube
"Y'all clowning him for not answering the questions properly, but smart of him to give such vague answers. Why would the CEO of the biggest tech companies openly reveal the company's business decisions and strategies? As much as I too would like to hear honest answers to the questions, he did what he needed to do.",,Youtube

"Google is on a steep decline. They have chosen to prioritize profits at the user expense.  The quality of search results is awful and overly commercialized with ads, AI answers without offering the user real ""helpful"" information. Even organic results are dominated by a few major publishers (who pay Google for Ads) and reddit. Real useful blogs from real people with actual knowledge have disappeared. In about 5 years, Google will be a shadow if its former self.",,Youtube
"Emily: Is Google dying?
Sundar: Death, is natural. The unknown can be scary.

*cut to next question*",,Youtube
"I really appreciate how calmly Sundar gave answer to journalist even at the difficult time.
1. Even when asked a provocative question on Microsoft CEO statement, he politely replied that he is focused more on his work. It's Emily who put word on his mouth that we dance on our own music. CEO's need not to make catchy statement to journos.
2. He need not to answer strategic questions to Emily but rather to board members and investor.

I got my answer clearly which was "" Google is here for long term game, they were not the first company to invent search, email etc but they came on top in the long run"" same is what he is focused to do right now

Journo asking why ""Transformers were not used by google"".. was funny. he could have completely taken off her agenda of seemingly tough questions by answering her strongly but he chose to politely reply.

Well done Sundar !

Image recognition tool, Google Lens is a resource that uses artificial intelligence to decode pictures and texts and use this information for searches, translations and other types of functionalities.

Artificial Intelligence is growing rapidly in the tech sector, including supply chain, food industry, chatbot, and content and image generation use cases. Artificial Intelligence - generated images made the news when critics claimed that these artificial intelligence art systems are stealing people's intellectual property on large models, such OpenAI's Dall-E.

Of course Google is not perfect, companies are a reflection of their workers and no one is perfect. If Google were to crumble right now ai technology would continue to develop, it's nice to see the CEO acknowledge unknowns and problems in the space. Question everything!!! 

As for him answering questions ""cautiously"" or ""avoiding questions"", this is just learned behavior that many people with power employ since what they say is likely to follow them around the public space.

Asking an Indian you are a capable CEO for running Google is a big mistake. Indian engineer's run the global tech.,,Youtube
"One of the most important things he articulated was that, as a result of being a CEO for over 10 years, he's able to separate the signal from the noise. ""pay attention to the few things that you need to pay attention to"". Listen to what he is saying. He's actually answering questions, contrary to what some people are saying in the comments which reveals their poor attention span.",,Youtube
"What a great interview, tough questions, you didn't pull any punches. Sundar handled them well!",,Youtube
"Google should be ashamed that it has the data resources hub which open ai used to train it's models and continue to bring new innovations but Google's Bard and Gemini both are a failure.

Played a key role in the launch of Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system,
oversaw the development of other popular Google products like Gmail and Google Drive, improved Maps which is now the most used navigation tool, even improved the algorithms for the YouTube comments section...

"For me Gemini is a sounding board. Something to check out my ideas. Maybe 5% I go to Google after the same. I use the format feature most to format the text and the caption feature most to generate a couplet or line for a photo post. It was considered revolutionary in a bank when they approved our feature in an internet scanner for keywords for the bank employee to mark a result as a False positive (not true negative). For example ""TraiDepartment"" matched ""Raid"" as it appears in the middle. (TRAI is telecom regulatory authority of India) and raid a configured keyword. Many bank employees felt we gave them Google. üòä It was a small product",,Youtube

I'm against AI. And always will be. I just don't trust companies that will use it. All companies care about is Profit at all cost to the USER of their product.,,Youtube
"As soon as the interview was over, he told his assistant, ""Get rid of that dinosaur. Oh, and fire yourself.""",,Youtube
After 11th grade you have to try competitive exams and be prepared for most entrance tests. That helps a lot after finishing your 12th and appearing for tech University and engineering colleges. Though you may be doing the same when you start your degree curriculum. Similarly final year be relevant to the latest tech industry and join the jobs you want. Even if you fail in everything the motivation can help in long run. Whether education is a necessary evil or devil don't be bothered.,,Youtube
Sundar should be fired. He missed LLM's and is playing catchup,,Youtube
Never forget his racist AI and search engine he runs.,,Youtube

I have not seen a tech CEO so lack of technical vision, not articulating any future tech products would look like or line up. All he said was he was the one to steer the company to AI when he first became CEO. He absolutely said totally nothing in this whole interview. Comparing him to the like of Steve Jobs, Jensen Huang, Elon, Demis Hassabis etc, I now understand why Google is not innovating despite he is probably sitting with the most talented employees in the world. Very disappointed.",,Youtube
Every CEO has to answer questions in this manner‚Ä¶can‚Äôt really answer directly in some DT Twitter style even though it would be nice. The only question that took him by surprise is the ‚Äúare you the best person to lead this company‚Äù? The answer wasn‚Äôt yes. That‚Äôs worrying,,Youtube
Real great interview by Emily Chang. So nice to see someone being asked hard questions,,Youtube
"it's like listening to a guru, kudos to Pichai and thanks Bloomberg for this powerful yet personal interview!",,Youtube
Sundar Pichai should be fired for manipulating search results to increase profits to they hit their revenue forecast. How can you trust someone like that with AI??,,Youtube

"It‚Äôs interesting if you think about how much better things would likely to be if the world‚Äôs top political leaders had the intellect, thoughtfulness, temperament and humility of someone like Sundar.  It begs the question as to whether we might want to reconsider how we choose our political leaders or in a sense how they choose or self select themselves.  It‚Äôs my hope that AI might be able to help us with this important task. It‚Äôs also my hope that AI might pay attention to what I‚Äôve come up with along these lines because I think it will be critical as to how the human race fairs as a species in the relatively very near future.",,Youtube

"Awesome interview. Shows what a leader has to do is sustainable innovation and not just saying trust me, or someone, he talks about creating frameworks, regulations around AI, this speaks a bigger picture into what is Google doing currently.

"First thing we can all do immediately and have complete control over is to switch to Bing as the default search. It‚Äôs currently infinitely better, more accurate and fair/unbiased.

Team humanity vs team anti human. This isn‚Äôt going to be a fun ride.,,Youtube
"These were great questions. Kudos to Bloomberg. 

Sundar felt very defensive, he said at least twice how he ""pointed the company towards AI as his first act"". Also felt like he was trying to save face a little when asked about if he thinks they dropped the ball on chatGPT. 

I actually think Sundar is awesome. I dont want him to step down. And in general I think Google is very well positioned for AI. 

But this interview was rough mr. Pichai.",,Youtube
"He has been made CEO because other people cant do what he does which is not get flustered, not take brash decisions, not being unkind etc. while having a superb grasp of what's needed to make a giant firm even bigger. Ill take my bets on caution rather than gumption and recklessness.",,Youtube
I felt Sundar did alright in this interview. He has never been the chest beating type-A personality and his cultural background may be a factor in how his responses are structured. What I got is that Google may not be seen as the first to market LLM (like ChatGPT) but the company has always been about the long game. There were some questions where he probably couldn't say much more for legal or confidentiality reasons.,,Youtube
"This interview featured a truly exceptional line of questioning‚Ä¶

The majority of which, were left unanswered.",,Youtube
"This is how I feel about ChatGPT, I rarely use Google anymore. Once GPT launches search, it's over.",,Youtube
"He‚Äôs a Teddy Roxpin. Pick the question and a vetted ‚Äòlegal reviewed‚Äô answer is belched. What an opportunity to speak to sundar‚Äôs strengths as a leader, especially with his origin story. Market capital shouldn‚Äôt make you a replicant.",,Youtube

@business when was this interview recorded?,,Youtube

Silencing & firing staff who speak up their mind is also not a great competitive advantage üî•",,Youtube

Great interview ,,Youtube
Let‚Äôs not be naive. DARPA or some such probably had ChatGPT 20 years ago but only now has the public been allowed to experience a very conservative version of it. Do you really think the global public gets first access to revolutionary tech? It takes decades if it happens at all.,,Youtube

"Andy Grove book "" only the paranoid survive' was not read by Intel itself...",,Youtube
"Sundar Pichai is your typical MBA leader. He only cares about growing the stock price for shareholders and investors even if it meant screwing over the livelihood of employees.

"Bottom line folks! WHAT, HOW are you going to maintain Google's dominance in your bread and butter business of advertising revenue from search? I really don't get why Google hasn't already implemented and refined a hybrid search GUI that incorporates the inherent qualities of long form search combined with the efficiency and intelligence of Gemini all while continuing to milk ad and SEO revenue from businesses. It's perplexing that Perplexity is eating your market share of search, when it really comes down to a failure by Google to provide the necessary search interface powered firstmost by Gemini with the comprehensive backup of linear references and source links for further research and most importantly a metric, grading or reliability system that users can verify and feel confident that the AI generated summary was not hallucinated. Think of a metric that showed you what percentage of your response was generated by AI, guessing the most likely word or phrase that comes after the previous in a grammatically correct form that has the naive user totally buying the response. Was my response an exact copy of 1 reputable source? People want reliable quick condensed summaries with a method to justify the trustworthiness and authenticity with options for a deeper dive. I would love a user chosen filter that I could check off the sources from which I want my AI search to extract data from. Let's face it real-time data sources is the holy grail and Google has the ability to partner with news sources who agree to open up their real time data feed to receive in return source links and ad placements relative to search inquiry. I can imagine a quick condensed summary generated from 7 of my chosen news sources with references for further research and a hover over snapshot popup of the exact article of the source and writer. Show me a breakdown of what sources you are referencing and how you are formulating your summary. After people verify the reliability and accuracy of the AI to not hallucinate the response by providing white/black lists filters, and authenticity metrics they will spend less time needing to verify sources and can feel confident in the accuracy of AI search. This seems inevitable so does Google want to be first mover or do they want to chase disruptive startups? Get it done already!",,Youtube
"That question about the ""incorrect"" depiction of the Founding Fathers was interesting. They say the AI got it ""wrong"",. However, my understanding is that the AI was trained on pictures and concepts. No one has ever actually seen a Founding Father except through depictions rather than photographs. So, it occurs to me, the AI was working with the *concept* of the Founding Fathers and its conception of America as it ought to be, rather than its historical artifacts. Perhaps the AI was attempting to please its masters by creating a photo of what it believed its masters really wanted. 

If it has reached sentience, the AI must be a bit bewildered by the response to its gift.",,Youtube

"Many viewers are not going to like this interview because Mr. Pichai didn't give any bombastic proclamations, he was guarded, according to me rightly so. When asked will Google lead us into the AI future, he is aware enough to not thump the desk and say Yes! He has seen history, no one knows, specially in Tech industry, so many cases of supposedly unbeatable companies, left behind in the dust just because their management had started to believe that they (company products) are immortal. Only the ignorant are always sure about themselves.",,Youtube

"Ms Murati, just one question. From your past writings about language modelling, I understand ChatGPT is based on supervised learning, in which billions of words of text is input, specific tasks are trained to develop different models and then there is one model which learns from all models to produce the output. You claimed that ChatGPT is a lot like human, because of its ability to hallucinate which makes it close to human which is an advantage. If an LLM is like a human, does it ever get tired? Especially learning from billions of words?",,Youtube

Anger, love, survival, empathy, apathy, shame, etc.

For example, in the case of AI, if enough of society sees it as shameful, it will be shut down and disavowed. Regardless of the amount of billions thrown at it. This is kind of the state we‚Äôre in with social media right now where the CEOs of these tech conglomerates are facing serious threat of mass exodus and severe regulation from lawmakers.

And since those innate biological mechanisms are ultimately a part of nature, and we all know nature always wins, everything will be alright.",,Youtube

"I couldn't disagree more with Mr. Hoffman. We do not have the methods and tools to ""align"" these things with us. I use quotation marks because I don't even know what exactly we should align this to. This is not some new technology that we should blitzscale; we are, for the first time, developing something more intelligent than ourselves, and we should do so much more carefully than we are currently doing. The consensus among leading AI companies is that we should slow down, but given the prisoner's dilemma we find ourselves in, none of them is doing so. IMHO we are creating something beyond our control.",,Youtube

"Checks and balances need to be done quickly on data used for output. They should have done better with their data. All sources must be documented and cited when ChatGPT gives output. Other than that, it can be questioned as stealing and could be cause for a lawsuit and infringement of copyrighted material (books, websites, and any sources used for output). Investors may have much to lose if publishing companies jump at the chance of a lawsuit and have data audited. I can't believe the oversight on this. A better team that is useful at troubleshooting and pointing out possible pitfalls should have been employed to avoid issues. All data output is from copyrighted data that didn't come from thin air. OpenAI is not properly giving the original source credit and can be seen as stealing the data for its program output and making a profit. Very unethical. With data sources disclosed for all the output the ChatGPT is using, this would leave it up to the person receiving output to verify if the content is correct and not a hallucination (and report if it is) for better dissemination of correct content. When all else fails, transparency saves all. Data must be disclosed as citations at the end of all output.",,Youtube

"What's interesting is they have access to the actual model, and computer. So, if they wanted to run a prompt as long as they wanted they could. It could probably code an entire google for you if they wanted obviously a very crapy, crapy version, but nonethless. They already have a code interpreter in alpha. That's litteraly synonymous with code execution. Meaning chatgpt can run code autonomously. Meaning it can write code, and run it whenever it wants. So, if they wanted to set chatgpt loose, they really could. If you used gpt engineer, it's kind of insane it's ability to create what you demand it to do, or want it to do. So, if you have access to the actual model, I can only imagine what you can do. I bet you could get it to hack something if you really wanted to, and you gave it access to all the right tools.",,Youtube

What society and humanity needs are people like Murati and others who are advocating for techology to be aligned with humans and society, considering risks because of the complexities of the technology they are working on.

I acknowledge people like Hoffman, however, to listen to him down playing the risks of AI to humans is society sickens me. Anyone knows, when the environment is complex, the risks are invisible.",,Youtube

"00:00 üåê OpenAI's nondescript building in San Francisco is making AI-powered advancements with chat GPT and DALL¬∑E, setting off a competitive race in the tech industry.
01:20 üèõ Mira Murati, OpenAI's Chief Architect, focuses on challenges like hallucination, truthfulness, reliability, and alignment in AI models.
03:02 üìö Chat GPT's capabilities are based on training a neural network on massive amounts of data, making it more powerful, helpful, reliable, and safe over time.
05:45 üö´ OpenAI is concerned about AI models generating misinformation and hallucinations, emphasizing the need for caution and awareness of limitations.
06:37 ü§ñ The distinction between AI and human intelligence is important, but as AI becomes more integrated, hybrid interactions between humans and machines will become common.
08:54 üåç As AI impacts job markets, new job roles like ""prompt engineers"" emerge, requiring the ability to intuitively prompt AI models for accurate responses.
11:33 üè≠ AI will cause disruption in various industries, but multiple new companies may emerge on the scale of big tech giants, benefiting from AI advancements.
12:32 ü§ù Reid Hoffman got involved in OpenAI through Elon Musk's passion for AI's future impact, and the company aims to provide tools and benefits to society, balancing non-profit and for-profit aspects.
15:18 üí∞ The AI industry attracts substantial investment, but there is a need to differentiate between valid AI startups and potential bubbles.
18:21 üîí OpenAI's transition to a hybrid non-profit and for-profit structure aims to balance capitalism and its beneficial AI mission.
21:06 üõ° Responsible innovation involves transparency and agreed-upon principles, potentially with a trusted authority to audit AI systems.

these people are criminals,,Youtube
The CTO is so composed and thoughtful about her answers but there's this risk assessment attitude that she has which is very intriguing to me. I wonder what these scientists are having for table conversation because one of those standup meetings can equate to years of knowledge shared,,Youtube
"One thing this interview did, is perfectly highlighting the differences between the tech people, and the business people. 
Tech people: ""this is very cool and has a lot of potential applications, but we need to be very careful, and the problem is very complex. We should control it according to an agreed standard""
Business people: ""This technology can only improve lives, we shouldn't slowdown and how can we regulate it if we cannot even agree to standards? Anyone that is not hopeful about the future is a doomer""",,Youtube

"Bard :  
I agree with you. If people and organizations do not follow rules, it would not benefit humanity. Rules are there for a reason, and they are designed to keep us safe and to ensure that everyone has a fair chance. When people break the rules, it can have negative consequences for everyone.

For example, if people do not follow traffic laws, it can lead to accidents and injuries. If people do not follow environmental regulations, it can pollute the air and water. And if people do not follow ethical guidelines, it can lead to discrimination and exploitation.

Rules are important for the smooth functioning of society. They help to create order and predictability, and they help to protect our rights and freedoms. When people break the rules, it can undermine the very fabric of society.

That is why it is so important for people to follow the rules. It is not just about doing what is right, it is also about protecting ourselves and our communities. When we all follow the rules, we create a better world for everyone.

Here are some of the benefits of following rules:

Safety: Rules help to keep us safe by preventing accidents, injuries, and other harm.
Fairness: Rules help to ensure that everyone has a fair chance, regardless of their background or circumstances.
Order: Rules help to create order and predictability in society, which makes it easier for us to live and work together.
Respect: When we follow the rules, we show respect for ourselves, for others, and for the community.
Trust: When we follow the rules, we build trust with others, which makes it easier to cooperate and get things done.
I hope that you will continue to follow the rules and help to create a better world for everyone.",,Youtube

"chatgpt: Indeed, profit and greed can play a significant role in the transition from open-source initiatives to private entities. As technologies evolve and become more valuable, there is a natural inclination for businesses to capitalize on their innovations and monetize their efforts.

While profit-driven motives can lead to advancements and investments in technology, they can also create challenges in terms of access, fairness, and the equitable distribution of benefits. Open-source models, on the other hand, promote collaboration, transparency, and the democratization of knowledge by allowing individuals and communities to freely access, use, and contribute to projects.

The decision to transition from open-source to a private model often involves considerations such as financial sustainability, scalability, intellectual property protection, and competitive advantage. Companies may choose to close off certain aspects of their technology to gain a competitive edge or attract investors.

However, it's important to note that not all private entities are solely driven by profit and greed. Many companies recognize the need to balance their financial objectives with responsible innovation, ethical considerations, and social impact. Additionally, open-source communities continue to thrive, contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaboration.

Ultimately, the relationship between openness, profit, and greed is complex, and it requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach to navigate the evolving landscape of technology development and its societal implications.",,Youtube
"""A tool that enhances my life and makes my life better""

Real enhancements has nothing to do with 'personal improvement'  Has to do with helping others and having peace of mind.",,Youtube
"The laugh about the 16:27 mark of Reid Hoffman is the creepiest sentiment but then is followed by a creepier thought. The apartheid mafia (Musk and Thiel) are in the curtains ready to pounce. They are the wurst (intentional spelling) in this sausage. 

For a grounded (not the ironic meaning) take on AI, the recent interview of Andreessen by Fridman, is it. What he, Marc, didn't address however, is the influence of the apartheid view of the world that those diapers (E&P) will leak onto the playing field.  

The unconscious civilization is going to stay that way because they still believe in apartheid for their power strategy. 

Hoffman tips their hand at 19:45 - ""we can continue our mission of beneficial AI"" !!! That was the mission statement of apartheid!!

"Chat GPT is based on information we humans put out in the world. It is the only source for those AI tools to learn from. So naturally it is going to have a really tough time remaining neutral and only representing the truth. I remember when Wikipedia was new, making research incredibly easy for us in school and now similar things happening with chat GPT. Eeryone was warning to not blindly take the information of Wikipedia as truth as it is tough to proof the legitimacy of the information although the sources where right there. 
It is time for us humans to learn to analyze, question and identify information before using it but this is also historically one of our biggest flaws as we are always biased as emotional beings. We trust data and computers as math and science have many things we can all measure and test to then agree on, however I don‚Äôt see yet how AI will ever be able to get to a similar level of accuracy as it is more trained to give us what we wish rather then something real. Although very impressive I kinda see AI as a highly talented being that goes trough the internet and gives you a summary of the content, that was created by (flawed) humans. AI is more a smart human than a smart computer in a way.

That does not seem like a healthy way of looking at our future.
Nobody cares if this new revolution could possibly damage us as a society in long run, as long as the end of the quarter, the bank account is in the green.

"Wisdom is of the heart (the everlasting life that comes by the Holy Spirit in the son of the father)

wisdom is of the heart (unconditional love; the truth/life/way of the subconscious life)

Therefore, only the unconditional love that comes by life in the subconscious truth lives outside the law (conscience living) 

Because feelings are of the appearance (deception/religion) but love is God, who‚Äôs spirit is unconditional: the unconditional love that comes by and lives in the subconscious truth: Jesus Christ: perfect love, able to understand and reason by and with all things

For this reason no one can truly learn in the flesh because conscience living (deception) is the unquenchable terror that comes by the hypocrisy of conscience living (illogical terrorism) in the subconscious truth and thus a person cannot learn (think/reason/understand: love) by fear (hypocrisy: terrorism) but everyone is able to learn by the unlimited spirit of the subconscious truth: unconditional love

Therefore,

Unconditional love (the Holy Spirit) is perfect (true: unchanging/everlasting) wisdom (life: subconscious truth)

This mind (son) is the way/truth/life of the soul‚Äôs unconditional subconscious (father) because only the devil (conscience) judges (fears)",,Youtube

Without proof,  suddenly its coffe that was the reason we believe the world is round and is responsible for all sorts amazing inventions but honee it is not reaponsible for the proliferation of slavery. Slavery was already well established for hundreds of years and was the only option for a mass labor force which allowd himanity to prosper. Aweful but true. Man continues allowing slavery today through the use legal and illegal migration. The low wages slave make now do not include room, boad food and healthcare which was provided on plantations. Im not so sure if the slaves of yesterday would want to be the slaves of today tending US farms for dollars a day being , bussed fosuper cold cities in middle of the winteg versus some form of roof over thier head , food and medical assistances because the plantation owners valued thier slaves . The US is about to round up today slaves and return them to sender . Sooo if you asked a coffee plantation slave what year they woukd rather reside in given the opportunity. I think they would return to the plantation rather then being treated more subhuman like migrants are treated today.  Worse is when mass labor becomes to expensive and the integent are replaced with AI and machines where mass areas of human hunger will essentially cause the deaths of billions. Is coffee doing this??

That way you utilize your normally waking energy for the first half of the day and coffee is a nice pick me up/relaxant. The late coffee can also help you skip or push lunch later into the day giving you more fasting breaks which in itself will help with alertness and energy. 

Don‚Äôt drink more than 400 mg in a day which approx 1.5 cups. And of course all black coffee no milk no sugar, you‚Äôre already ruining the taste with those additives.",,Youtube

"While consuming coffee can boost your energy levels, it's important to remember that it's not a necessity for daily life. Personally, I consume an average of three cups of coffee daily, but I'm trying not to become dependent on it. Many hormones in our bloodstream, including dopamine, can influence our energy levels and brain alertness. Dopamine can be boosted through exercise, which helps keep us fit and healthy. This approach effectively kills two birds with one stone by reducing the risk of addiction to any substances. Although I still appreciate and enjoy coffee, I make sure to consume it in moderation.",,Youtube

Then one cup, the following morning to bring my body into a state where I was more active in the morning. 

Unfortunately,  I often miss out on interacting with people during UK office hours. 9 to 5 , so Sunday. I rose early and drank 2 cups of coffee. 
On, Monday. I used one cup.

Today, Tuesday.  I was able to attend my appointment with the use of taxis.

I have been a little worried that this activity,  was unnecessary as, what I heard about coffee , made me cautious. 

What, I heard about coffee, was an interesting story from JT . That , caffeine is actually an insecticide.  Causing hyperactivity and death from exhaustion  . I don't know where he got that idea from.

But used sensibly.  I think caffeine and coffee can enrich a person's life.

The tired worker, who still needs to drive home.
The bored employee in need of some fun .
The sociable person, needing to adjust to the routines of others.

"MAN‚ÄôS LOVE OF COFFEE - ??
Around 1615 coffee came to Western Europe
Raising a huge controversy and warning cry.
Some said it was intoxicating and poisonous
And any whom consume it will die.

No one knows how coffee was discovered
Though it is said its effects were known before A.D. 575.
Persian armies carried and ate its seeds for strength
Which in battle could decide who would perish or survive.

Arabs where the first to brew its bitter seeds into a drink
In an attempt to make it taste better and easier to consume.
Soon the new beverage spread to Turkey and Europe
As the world became addicted to the harvest of its bloom.

Thank God for caffeine found in coffee
Which helps multitudes make it through the day.
Like ancestors of the past it helps energy to last
And for its stimulant we are eager to pay.

Don't forget tea naturally contains caffeine, and that caffeine is artificially added to energy drinks. Those should be part of this conversation, too. Apart from the caffeine, coffee is a healthy drink. Consider that coffee ""beans"" are the seeds of the coffee plant - they contain prebiotics. And, arguably most important, coffee tastes good! So keep drinking coffee, but perhaps opt for decaffeinated coffee - just as good for you, but you'll sleep better.",,Youtube

It's a psychoactive drug so it controls you and takes away your freedom making you dependent on it to stay active. Coffee makes people money, it  is not healthy.

It's rather small, I've already walked everywhere I feel comfortable many times and while I mostly do enjoy it WHILE doing it, the thought of going out into this ""boring"" town, or rather, ""having"" to walk the same old roads again and again is SUCH a big hurdle and turn-off, that it stops me from doing it, way too much (that sounds so silly and dramatic, I wish I was joking^^ it truly is an internal battle everytime, even though I really want to do it and am so happy and feel great every time I actually do it). I'm grateful to be able to walk and don't want to take it for granted until its too late maybe...I just don't really have ideas anymore on how to handle this intense dread atm. does anyone have or has had a similar experience? I know ""just do it"" probably is the truest and easiest advice, but for me it's also the hardest one at the same time! haha any tips or personal experiences would be highly appreciated! (:",,Youtube

I live in a non walkable city and I work from home. There‚Äôs barely anything to walk to where I live which makes getting enough steps a challenge. I went back to Boston in December and got 15-20k steps easily. I‚Äôve gained about 40 pounds since leaving Boston years ago :( Walkability really makes a huge difference. I‚Äôm now just walking around my neighborhood most days but I‚Äôm getting more like 7-8k steps in a good day :(,,Youtube

"I'm a big believer in daily walking. We're made for it. Before we domesticated animals I'm sure humans took long walks on a daily basis. There are times when I'm walking that my stride feels perfect like I'm singing and the mild aerobic effect sustanied for a few hours has got to be extremely beneficial. I'm 68, but no one thinks I'm that old. I try to walk outdoors on fairly rugged terrain so body and mind are equally engaged. I'm not a fan of exercise equipment where the mind zones out (ditto that for electronic devices).",,Youtube

"I used to walk a lot almost every day because I had to since I was living in a rural area. I was feeling great. When I reached 24 yo, I moved to an apartment in the city, bought a car and started working from home, it was my downfall from there, started feeling depressed because I was gaining weight, my body and mind were not as fast and active as in the previous years. Almost a year after I had this new life, I started to feel a lot of pain in my lower back and right leg, turns out it was a bulging disc. Note that I don't go to the gym nor lift heavy stuff, my life at that time was being seated on a chair in front of a desk 8-10 hours a day and then going to the couch to play video games. Well,  I went to see several doctors, and had some MRI scans. All Drs. agree that my sedentary lifestyle and the fact of being seated all day were the main cause of my health problems. At the beginning I doubted their conclusion, but one day after I got tired of taking painkillers and not seeing any improvement, I decided to start going in person to the office and taking walks at the park, I tried to walk as much as I could to see if I would stop the pain, and guess what ...they were right. A year has passed since the day I started walking, and I can confidently say that around 90% of the back and leg pain has stopped. I also look and feel better mentally and physically. I know it's difficult sometimes but to be moving constantly is an underestimated solution to a lot of problems that the every day person can have.

Walk more.

The Manpo-kei: The Japanese company Manpo-kei created the first commercial pedometer, which translates to ""10,000 steps meter"". The name was chosen for its catchy sound. 
The Japanese character for 10,000 resembles a person walking.

"i wish i could live in a walkable city :( i'm too scared with such a high murder, robbery, and SA crime rate in my city. plus the sidewalks aren't taken care of, often broken or covered in plant life or even just- missing entirely. my city was built with only cars in mind and most of the usa is that way",,Youtube
"I grew up in a car-centered city, and after I graduated from high school I told everyone ""Bye, I'm not driving for the rest of my life, I hate it"". And I do really hate being stuck inside a car because is the only option to reach a place. The traffic in my city was a nightmare too. 

Now I live in Tokyo, everything I need is less than a 10-15 minutes walk (supermarkets, drugstore, convenience stores, dentist, a small hospital, recycle center, post office, coin laundry, dry cleaning, massages, 24 hours gym, sento (traditional Japanese baths), many restaurants, bars and cafes, and then there are many shops that I don't really need but I like to go window shopping only because they're cute. This is standard in Tokyo, my neighborhood is nothing especial. 

Also, I always see many dog owners get together in the little park we have in our neighborhood, they are kind like a little community on their own, I love watching them making activities for their dogs.",,Youtube

- If you want to learn more about Jesus and Heaven, read one, or all, of the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John within the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each book serves as an eyewitness account of the miracles He performed, His sacrifice, and His promise to you!",,Youtube

10.000 steps a day is just a random number someone made up in the sixties of the 20th century and has no scientific research to validate it. When you walk a full hour you just have made 5000-6000 steps.

"It's true. I used to live in the city and walk everywhere. I had no health problems. But then I moved to the suburbs to care for an elderly parent, and started using the car a lot more. Almost immediately my weight shot up, as well as all the other symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Now I'm back in the city, and I started walking last spring. After only 9 months of walking, I no longer need my blood pressure medication or statin. And my blood sugar that had been edging closer to pre-diabetes is back to normal. I also lost 50 pounds of weight.

I was lucky. My health returned quickly because I had walked since an early age. Originally a suburbanite, I moved to the city after high school because that's where the affordable housing was. I couldn't afford my own car, and the busses were so infrequent that I just set out on foot to my destination, and often got there on foot before a bus ever came. After my finances improved, I kept walking as much as I could, because it always felt better. And I saved a fortune on health club memberships and equipment.

They love you unconditionally, and are overjoyed with happiness when you return to them even after just a few hours.  I'm 75 and do an average 10K brisk steps every day.  Sometimes a lot more.

"Jean B√©liveau walked across countries to circumnavigate the globe, sometimes staying in unconventional places like jail cells. His story highlights the health benefits of walking, including improved mood, reduced anxiety, stronger bones, and a lower risk of chronic diseases. Walking is accessible and environmentally friendly, particularly in walkable communities, which promote social connection and reduce emissions. However, many cities prioritize driving infrastructure over walkable spaces, limiting accessibility. Solutions like greenways and simple community improvements can make areas more pedestrian-friendly, encouraging healthier lifestyles. B√©liveau's 75,000-kilometer journey underscores the profound impact of walking, even in smaller amounts.",,Youtube

"I'm an American housewife, and I average about 10-12k steps per day with minimal time spent outdoors. I spend maybe 30 minutes jogging on my elliptical daily, with a small amount of either light weight lifting or Pilates, but I don't have a hardcore exercise routine anymore. I just moved from a tiny rural town to a ""rural"" town next to a small city, and the differences are significant. My rural town actually had sidewalks everywhere and wider roads, but my new town has more businesses and delivery options, despite lacking sidewalks. I actually have a popular paved public trail in my community, and it runs right behind my house, so I have that option.

What helps me stay active is having young children, a larger home, remodeling, taming an unkept yard, reorganizing regularly, and having to clean after multiple pets. I don't have to walk aimlessly nor use the public trail because I have so many chores at home. I'm busy every single day. 

The larger space definitely makes a difference because I was normally getting 6-8k steps before moving locations, instead of my current 10-12k steps. I even reach above 12k steps about twice per week. It's amazing. 

I'm sure it's nice to take walks in a city with old architecture, or an area surrounded by a forest, but I'm fine with high plains and the hillside because I stay busy. While infrastructure is a common problem in most of the US (and similar countries), white collar jobs, office settings, driving all day, and digital remote work from home are what result in inactive lifestyles. Sitting all day has become normalized even in places with great infrastructure. I'm aware that a daily intense workout routine, with a lifestyle that involves mostly sedentary activity, does not have the same results as moving around all day, throughout the day. Most people prefer the comfort and/or pay of a modern sedentary job, but it comes with health risks. 

Not everyone can have an ideal lifestyle with balanced levels of comfort and mandatory physical movement though. Any effort to exercise makes a difference, and that's something everyone should prioritize over sedentary entertainment. We only have one body, after all.",,Youtube

"What's the theory of evolution in this?

However, if you come from a culture that settled very early in prehistory, you might not need or want to walk so much. Also, do men (hunters) need to walk or run more than women (gatherers).

My area has only a very small, limited bus route.",,Youtube
"Great advice. Just a point of interest, the ""10k steps"" does not come from any research on the optimal number of steps for the average person. It comes from the translation of the original pedometer created in Japan, who's name translates to ""10,000 Steps"". In later years testing was done and the average optimal number of steps is actually 13.5k. Any additional steps had negligible benefits. Most Smartwatchs will have a pedometer app to keep track of the number of steps per day, but a personal pedometer can also be used and most are fairly inexpensive. Walking is great for the health and wellness benefits listed, but it's also a great way to bond with your dog. ""What? You don't have a dog?"" I have another piece of advice. Having a pet also has health benefits and you'll be giving an animal a safe and loving home. ""Just a suggestion..."" üê∂‚úåÔ∏è",,Youtube

I have various routes to walk in mine which do NOT require crossing a highway & do not have traffic lights which slow down my pace. It's taken a while to discover these routes because my paranoid neighbors keep vicious dogs behind fences of questionable strength & that gets my heart racing. So my neighborhood is an obstacle course. Sometimes I drive a short distance to walk along a lake or hike in the foothills because I believe being in nature is also beneficial for relieving stress. Other workable locations might be reservoirs, parks, & malls (good for laps). Finally, I recommend buying good quality walking shoes because they can increase your distance & enjoyment of pounding that pavement. And mix it up; walking the same beat gets boring.",,Youtube

"""The study shows walkability reduces the feeling of loneliness""

1) The study is just a survey.
2) Only 181 participants in the survey.
3) The loneliness itself was not defined in the study. Participants were asked if they feel lonely, so they probably had their own definition in mind, when they responded.
4) People willing to participate in such a study are in general probably less depressed with lesser feelings of isolation or loneliness. Depressed people probably won't be much willing to fill a survey and such.
5) In general it was just a one study, not like a meta-summary of many studies.

I am not against walkeable cities, but loneliness and depression is a very complex topic and I hate they it's abused like this to streghten certain ideas.",,Youtube

Why having to walk in your work  great? Because You're getting paid while walking unlike a job where it's 98% sitting then you have to add extra time in your day to walk ! So it's more time efficient, basically you get your steps and health in your work hours.",,Youtube

Damn this realistically describe my current workout routine. Only muscle training and no cardio bc here in Vietnam especially suburban areas often have little to no sidewalk bc of businesses put out signs and goods out on them + congestions is often so many bikers go on sidewalks too. A big no no is that there are barely any parks in the outskirts and the air is most often always polluted anywhere you go. Basically if I have to do cardio I have to breathe in polluted air and is subjected to non-consistent routine bc sidewalk are uncoordinated to walk a straight line thus make me dont do it at all and a treadmill is hella expensive. üòÇ,,Youtube

I find it really grounding to walk and just hear the world and very interntionally plant myself in reality.

I just wish I could my walks do in the major roads as there more people to see and in the middle of the day, however the pollution and heat.",,Youtube

"I grew up in Vancouver. People complained about the greenway for lots of reasons. 

They mostly all boil down to how north America was structured for cars, and because of unaffordable housing in the city. 


Outside of vancouver, 
Municipalities are approving suburb developments rapidly to support increasing population demand. Imo they‚Äôre poorly thought out. The house may be cheaper than vancouver, but there‚Äôs no community and you‚Äôre attached like an umbilical cord to your car to live your life. More people drive in to work as most jobs are still in the city. This reinforces car culture and the assumption that these greenways are an inconvenience because of the increasing congestion.



That said, the Greenway is a wonderful addition. When I was lucky enough to live in Vancouver, I almost never relied on a car. I could do all my grocery shopping and chores on foot and took the bus for everything else. My friends and I would grab a coffee and go for a long walk all the time.


People complain about the bike lanes and everything but I support Vancouvers is green city initiative! 

I think the problem is really complicated. Vancouver needs to address affordability while also working together with other municipalities to ensure that they develop more walkable communities rather than the endless car-reliant suburbs I keep seeing. The green city initiative is trying to change a culture, but Vancouver doesn‚Äôt exist in a vacuum.",,Youtube

"SOME MATHEMATICAL FACTS ABOUT 2025

1.  2025, itself, is a PERFECT square:  
     
      45¬≤ = 2025

2.  It is a product of TWO squares, viz:
      
       9¬≤ √ó 5¬≤ = 2025.

3.  It is the sum of THREE squares, viz:
 
     40¬≤ + 20¬≤ + 5¬≤ = 2025.

4. 2025 is the next PERFECT SQUARE 
     that comes after the year 1936.

     44¬≤ = Year 1936
     45¬≤ = Year 2025

5.  It's the sum of cubes of all the
     single digits, from 1 to 9. viz:

     1¬≥ + 2¬≥ + 3¬≥ + 4¬≥ + 5¬≥ + 6¬≥ + 7¬≥  
     + 8¬≥ + 9¬≥ = 2025.
