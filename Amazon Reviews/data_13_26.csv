B08D2DJPD3,Perfect...cut metal box vibrant colors.  love,5
B08D2DJPD3,"Love it! What beautiful paints, did not disappoint!",5
B08D2DJPD3,So many colors. Highly recommend,5
B08D2DJPD3,It did she love to draw and paint,5
B08D2DJPD3,Love this product,5
B08D2DJPD3,"I'm a watercolor artist -- just as a hobby. Been doing it for years. I bought this for an overseas trip because of it's small size for packing purposes. I am STILL using this set months later! I used to lug around a TON of watercolor paint tubes, paper, brushes. Trying to figure out if I could get it through airport security... If you need a set that is super small for travel.. this is it.I bought it for travel, but I'm still using it daily! Great product, and will most likely buy another one when I run out just because of how easy it is to close it all up and pack in a bag :-)",5
B08D2DJPD3,"I got these on a black friday sale and they are really nice. Vibrand and hold colors well. Can't wait to test them out more, there is a good array of colors including the sparkly ones, and packaged nicely. The brushes are a plus. A+",5
B08D2DJPD3,"I took this for trip abroad to do en plain air painting.  I didn't want to have to carry a large pallet or individual paint tubes.  The variety of colors is fun, and you can use the lid for mixing.  I found the accompanying plastic color swatch card was not accurate to color or even order of paints in the pan.  Thank goodness they provided a watercolor paper card to dab on the actual paint, but even it didn't list all the colors in the pan.I wish the paint had more pigment for richer colors, but it worked well for traveling and I will continue to use it for some quick outdoor painting.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"The paints themselves are okay. This is my first set so I have nothing to compare it to. I like the ease of transport.The box was not made well; as you can see, the closure came loose. I requested a replacement, which looks to be in better shape.I will say, I really like the black marker that comes with this. It holds up to water really well so you can paint, ink, and paint again (It's not pictured here, that's a Pigma Micron inked drawing).The plastic water-holding squeeze pen is literally impossible to open. I tried so many ways. I compared it with one I bought at a college for under $1; that one opened instantly. This one is poorly constructed.One of my main gripes with this set is that the swatch paper does not match the layout of the paints. Sounds like a minor issue, I know, but it seriously slows down my work flow and feels like such a simple, thoughtless detail that makes such a huge difference.It's off brand, so I guess you get what you pay for.",3
B08D2DJPD3,"This kit has it all, quality colors & brushes & canvas paper. Everything you need all in one. Colors are beautiful and ready to use. Empty swatch page to see what the colors look like on paper- genius!",5
B08D2DJPD3,Gift given,5
B08D2DJPD3,"The water brush is nice, and the included brush seems decent enough. The metal case is a nice touch. However, as I was trying to follow tutorials online I was struggling. It looked so easy but it was a challenge to get enough color on the brush. I ended up buying a much better quality, name brand paint from a local art supply and the difference was shocking. Now, the better paints were considerably more money for less paint - get what you pay for - but if you are struggling with these, consider upgrading.",3
B08D2DJPD3,I've started using them daily and I live everything about them. Will need to get more soon at this rate.,5
B08D2DJPD3,Love the whole box,4
B08D2DJPD3,"Great quality, convenience and value",4
B08D2DJPD3,Nice little craft project.  Perfect size - easy to store.,4
B08D2DJPD3,"My only complaint is the water brush it releases too much water, but the paint itself works great I work with a lot of neon colors for my art. They have good coverage a little goes along way.",5
B08D2DJPD3,Good color range,5
B08D2DJPD3,"Easy to use, beautiful color assortment!",5
B08D2DJPD3,"great colors, no need to mix and good coverage.  Excellent student grade paints",4
B08D2DJPD3,"My daughter is a beginner water color artist. I bought these for her because she is just getting started. She is also a "" minimalist. She loves how compact it is. I am more experienced with water color. The colors did not have enough pigment for me.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"I'm an acrylic painter. I recently decided to switch things up and try watercolor. This set is so affordable, easy to set up, and is great quality. I am OBSESSED with these colors. I totally recommend!!",5
B08D2DJPD3,"Very nice palette of watercolors gives you lots of choices. It's great for someone like me who really doesn't like to mix colors a lot. I've found the shiny colors are not shiny once on page, which is disappointing. I'm overall very happy with the product",4
B08D2DJPD3,"Metal case with rounded corners. Beautiful colors, has a color guide and a sample sheet for you to get a feel for the colors yourself. A fine line brush and a brush you can fill with water. A marker and place to mix your colors. It also comes with paper the same size- so easy to take anywhere you want to paint!",5
B08D2DJPD3,"It's a beautiful set to give as gifts. I bought for 3 kids ages 12, 11 and 8 and the other for an adult. I think I'll get one for myself as well. The note pad included is small, but perfect for travel and you can keep everything in the box it came in and travel with it. I like that the paints and brushes are all secure and neat in a metal with clasp pretty box and that there are spaces so you can mix colors right in the box lid. Great product, very happy.",5
B08D2DJPD3,"I purchased 2 sets for my husband and I so we can bring it with us when we travel. The box it came in was really nice and the quality of the material is good.Pro: Easy to blend and very pigmented. Convenient for travel and the price is great for what you get. It comes with a water color swatch for you to match the colors. Though I misplaced the light blue (321a) and cobalt (32a) on the chart the colors overall are nice for the price. Most of the colors are on spot and doesn't need to be reapplied.Con: I am disappointed with the color Apricot. On the packaging it has a pinker tone to it. The color in the tin is more orange. Also fairy dusk requires several layers of paint in order to see. It's not as pigmented as the other colors.Overall this is a nice water color set for anyone on a budget or wants to get started with water colors without spending a lot. I would say this kit is better than most water color kits in the same price range. If all the colors in the kit were true to the color chart provided by the company I would be giving this a 5 star. This review deserves a 4.8 stars if it was possible. However, Amazon doesn't have that rating system so it would have to settle for a 4.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"The colors are okay, but the swatch card does not match up with the actual rows of paint. Very frustrating. Also, the pans are ridiculously small.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"I think this set is good for a beginner, (like me) but the tin that the paints came in was much smaller than I thought. Maybe I missed seeing the measurements. It also came bent up. It's pretty flimsy. I'm no expert, but having said all that, I still think it'll serve the purpose I need for now.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"It has a cute appearance, the colors aren't very bright, but it's easy to clean, and the size is perfect for traveling. The brush is very durable. Worth the money.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"I got this specifically because I wanted to dabble in watercolor. Unfortunately they didn't really teach me a lot. So in some ways this is a very unique art supply. The texture is very unique. Color quality is good and metallics are beautiful. However they don't really function like traditional watercolor. They kind of look like colored pencils once they dry. You can definitely get a traditional watercolor look working with them but they don't really want to be watercolor. They're a bit chalky? It's like working with liquid colored pencil.That being said there are very interesting art supply in their own way. Because they have that colored pencil texture they're actually amazing for colored pencil work. Buildable can go over and under water soluble materials. Because it's water soluble if you overlay with them woth wax there's a lot of potential there.So yes I recommend these for beginners but for mixed media artists too. They're very strange and kind of in their own category. I kind of look at them as their own thing. I might even buy this palette again when I run out because I found uses for it that I like. Paired with not only more traditional watercolor but also colored pencils.I will say the White and the black are not white and black. They are cream and a dark gray. Not that a good deal. I actually like them as colors in their own right but definitely worth noting.And if the company reads this hi can I please get a larger pallet of those metallics? Just the metallics they're freaking gorgeous. I did an entire piece in just the copper, just like a one-tone study and it looks amazing.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"Very convenient, easy to use, and take during travel",5
B08D2DJPD3,"These are very nice watercolor paints.  Vibrant colors and easy to work with.  The tin case is great to have since it will last.  Overall, very happy with this purchase.",5
B08D2DJPD3,"Using for watercolor lessons, will be sufficient for ""exercises""  I was looking for specific paint names for some of more complex exercises, but really efficient for kids.  I like the extra little book of small watercolor paper.",4
B08D2DJPD3,"Not only are there multiple colors, there is a brush, watercolor pen, water spreader and a small pack of watercolor paper in a nice metal case. The recipient can try it out immediately!",5
B08D2DJPD3,This set is beautiful. The water brush cleans easily between colors. The pigments are vibrant and the pen works great in beautiful black. I'm so happy with this set.,5
B08D2DJPD3,I looove this product! I brought this on a camping trip and everyone had a blast pairing their own creation. The colors are beautiful and the whole thing is great quality.,5
B08D2DJPD3,"I love this little set.  It's compact.  It's rich and colorful.  The paints activate with water easily.  The paint pellets are deeply set in their compartments which makes it neat and tidy.  I like a tidy paint set.  I don't like spill over from neighboring paint pellets.I appreciate the little template with the color chart and the swatch paper they gave us.  It's very useful.  The paintbrush they provided it perfectly sized for this set.  They gave us a paint pen marker and a water brush.  And the price is very reasonable for everything they give us.If you're a beginner like me, this paint set gives us so many choices of colors.  I'm clumsy mixing paints for colors and I don't need to do that so much with this set.  They give us lovely metallic colors and the Sharpie neon colors for fun.  How they will hold up, time will tell.  But I love my set and will by a set each for my nieces and nephew for Christmas.",5
B08D2DJPD3,I'm a fairly new watercolor artist and this palette has lots of great colors that would normally require lots of mixing and getting just right. In other words it takes my watercolors of another notch. Also I did not think that I would like the water brush but I do. It's very versatile.  I've ordered more expensive pallets and still go back to this one. The paint is vibrant and builds nicely.,5
B08D2DJPD3,"Okay these colors are fabulous! My kids are wondering why they don't get upgraded paints like mama ;) There is such a nice array of colors, values here that this is a great kit to play with as you mix and create your masterpiece. I am just testing out colors so far but love them!",5
B08D2DJPD3,"To be fair I have not used these yet however I am pleasantly surprised at the value of materials provided based on just opening the package I got during Prime Days. For real, anyone can make 48 colors plus 10 sheets of watercolor paper and some brushes work for them even if they are just experimenting.  A+ y'all.",5
B08D2DJPD3,Great gift,5
B08D2DJPD3,Watercolor artist a perfect paint set!,5
B08D2DJPD3,"Just received the paint set. Initial thoughts... cute case, cheap thin plastic holding everything inside, cheap brush and water pen... generally looks no different than a $5 watercolor set for kids. I've not used the paints yet but the variety of colors is nice. Will update w/ info on the paints themselves later.",3
B08D2DJPD3,"This is a great small travel set of watercolor paints, a couple brushes, a color sheet, a book of paper (which fits inside the tin!) And a sponge.Saw a few reviews about the metallic color being weak, however, I feel watercolor should be softer and more of a wash than acrylic....soooo....yeah. I love the colors, each one has been well used, the only color I found myself not using often was the black, which is normal for my style.The paper in the booklet is quality watercolor paper. The brush is great, mine didn't leak. The bonus of the black acrylic marker pen was excellent.Downside....it's a travel kit, small and the pans of paint will go quick with daily use. Could be a better fleshy color, as the peachy sand color is the only color close to Caucasian....but that kind of whatever. Also, the metallic paints will absorb an insane amount of water if you aren't careful, and then become complete mush. Let it dry out for a few days and it solidifies again.Bought it for use while traveling....as it should be LolLoved it. Will by again.",5
B08D2DJPD3,I like the colors and nice tin. A lot of bang for your money.,5
B08D2DJPD3,Thought the paints would be a little larger but I'm excited to try these and the extra colors!:-),5
B08D2DJPD3,"these are great quality paints, this set is a nice compact size. i have both the pink set and the little teal travel set and there are differences- first being the paint themselves are about half the size of the pink set, yet the eraser and sponge are both bigger and it does comes with a sharpener, the pink one doesn't. the paper that comes is smaller as well as they are made to fit inside the tin. also in the teal travel set the paints are glued in which is why i docked it a half star,  i greatly dislike that because for one, i rearange them to a different order as i feel they don't come in the ""right"" order, and also because once i get down to the bottom there will be glue down there. the paints themselves are glued directly into the thin plastic tray, wheras in the pink set they are in square holders and then in the plastic liner.  the last difference is that some paints have different names, yet seem to be pretty similar in colors to the different names in the other set, so i don't mind that. its still an excellent variety of color as well as being high quality paints.**so to sum it up- i do recommend the pink set over this smaller teal set since its very similar in price but the pink set is double the paint, plus the fact that the pink set has individual holders verses being glued directly into the plastic liner.** i rate the pink set a 5 and this teal set a 4.5",4
B08D2DJPD3,This has been such a treat and I am using it every night. So glad I bought it!,5
B08D2DJPD3,"It is my companion during travel - has beautiful colors, brushes, Inc pen and a light case.  Just add Crarft 'n' Beyond calligraphy pen.",5
B08D2DJPD3,Love the colors and compactness of the set.  Will purchase again when I use these up.,5
B08D2DJPD3,"I think a great watercolor set!  I am the beginner, wanted to try the watercolor painting for the first time and decided on this color palette, I feel like easy to create with it.",5
B08D2DJPD3,Niece loved it!!,5
B08D2DJPD3,I am a beginner and this set is working fine for me. It gives me lots of colors to choose from.,5
B07R1WKMB3,I consider myself a pen and marker snob. These pens are amazing for the price. I bought them for my daughter but they are nice enough I'd buy them for myself. They do smear a bit but not anymore than other gel pens. The colors are bright and varied. I'd definitely buy these again.,5
B07R1WKMB3,"These have beautiful, bright colors ! They write so smooth too ! Unlike some gel pens, these do not junk up at all ! Great quality with an amazing price !",5
B07R1WKMB3,Just received these pens and I love them! I really enjoy using different colors when I journal and take notes.  Very happy with this purchase and I recommend them.,5
B07R1WKMB3,"I originally got these for my daughter, but I find myself using them quite a bit, too! The colors are pretty and there's a nice variety as well. Two negatives... One of the purple pens did not work at all no matter what we tried. Also, these tend to leave glitter EVERYWHERE, but I guess that's what you get with glitter pens! I would definitely get these again, or another type from this company. Good quality and a great price.",5
B07R1WKMB3,"LOVED Everything About These Pens , The Cost Was Fantastic , The Pens Have Lasted Me For A Very Very Long Time The Pens Dont Dry Up After A Short Period Of Time Thats Why I Love Them , Have Had No Leakage And No Smearing Or Blotchiness On The Paper , I Use The Pens When I Am Finishing My Art Work And LOVE The Glitter Pens , It's Comfortable In My Hand Like A Paint Brush Is , And Durablilty Like I Said Lasts A Long Time Without Drying Up Have Had Them Now For About Three Years And Still Have Not Dried Up , So Extremely Happy I Got Them !!!",5
B07R1WKMB3,"I know it says for adults, but my 5 little old boy loves this set! Even got another one to give as a gift. Durable, functions very well.",5
B07R1WKMB3,Good,5
B07R1WKMB3,Work very well for my purposes. I use them on adult coloring books.,5
B07R1WKMB3,It includes a great array of colors including some glitter pens. And the price was a good value. There's a nicely fine tip. They don't seem to bleed through most papers. But the writing line isn't always consistent. I'm left handed and have found that can be a common issue.,4
B07R1WKMB3,Good pens But they will bleed,4
B07R1WKMB3,I use them for journaling and coloring. Nice rich shades. Good value.,5
B07R1WKMB3,I have ordered these so many times over the years!,5
B07R1WKMB3,Lots color,5
B07R1WKMB3,"Awesome, for the grandkids that love to draw",5
B07R1WKMB3,Our creative niece loved this gift.,5
B07R1WKMB3,I am sad because the case of gel pens are missing one pen.,4
B07R1WKMB3,Used these pens for a mandala coloring book. They were great for small details. Loved the glitter pens!!,5
B07R1WKMB3,Needs more glitter pens,4
B07R1WKMB3,These work great for adult coloring books. They can get in small spaces yet fill larger spaces quickly. Reason I gave it a 4 is because some of the colors are very similar.,4
B07R1WKMB3,The writing quality and ink flow in these gel. Pens is perfect. It is smooth.The quality for the price is excellent and you get a ton of pens. These will be purchased when they run out.Love that there is neon glitter regular,5
B07R1WKMB3,Students want options other than candy-these pens are an affordable addition to a prize box!,5
B07R1WKMB3,The pens write easily and smooth.The colors are true and bright except for the sparkle ones. They are a bit difficult to see,4
B07R1WKMB3,Great product and loved the number of pens in this package for thr price,5
B07R1WKMB3,These are for my sister to use and she loved them.,5
B07R1WKMB3,Love these pens!!!!!!!!!,5
B07R1WKMB3,They work wonderfully & beautifully colors,5
B07R1WKMB3,great idea for future artist,4
B07R1WKMB3,"I expect whether on sale or not, if stated new, to get New Product!! These have obviously been used as certain pens if not all are missing ink. Especially the blue pen. Today I sat down to inspect them & that's the 1st thing I noticed. So while I get the price now, at least be honest when used previously!! Now the most used color will run out before the rest.",3
B07R1WKMB3,"I do love the ink and the color variations I am giving three stars because after only coloring a few pictures in a coloring book I noticed the ink is getting low and will not last for more than another one or two pages in my book I ordered to use them with. Also, one of the 2 purple pens doesn't work. I tried to fix it and get it working with no success. Recommend ordering a product with more pens than this one comes with.",3
B07R1WKMB3,Love these pens great color spreads great in the paper there's no leakage The ink filters came with them The pens  function perfectly I love that they came with refills overall great quality,4
B07R1WKMB3,Great gel pens they do not skip roll smooth would buy again,5
B07R1WKMB3,"These are great gel pens.  I appreciate all the bright colors in this pack.  They last a long time.  So far, I have not had any issues with them aside from a purple that turned out grey!  These are good quality and I would highly recommend them.",5
B07R1WKMB3,We all love these gel pens for coloring. Good value for all the pens in this package.,5
B07R1WKMB3,Quick drying with good ink flow. Good color variety,5
B07R1WKMB3,I bought these for my granddaughter for Christmas.  I did try a couple of the pens out to make sure they were going to work.  I worked perfectly.  She's going to love it.  I'm going to repurchase these for myself.,5
B07R1WKMB3,Got these for my granddaughters for Christmas. They love to write and draw.,5
B07R1WKMB3,"I recently picked up a bunch of art supplies last Prime Day and decided to try these, having seen some unique pen art on the Internet.  I'm a working adult, so I don't use these in a school setting and I don't do adult coloring books.  You can see by the photos I attached I'm definitely not a refined or even trained artist, but after years of digital art, I'm very much enjoying art with physical mediums.Right off the bat, I'll cover what I state in the review title:  If you want to do pen art like that of mine shown, you may want to peruse other gel pens here on Amazon.  You can see that the sky in my art is only faintly scribbled and lined in;  The light blue, gray, and dark green pens of my set are almost fully depleted of their ink from this one piece of art and as far as I can tell, these pens are not refillable.  Also, to briefly go on a tangent, if you do want to do full page pen art, I recommend getting some art or sketch paper.  Small doodles by these pens here and there on a sheet of plain paper will be fine, but large and/or intensely colored and detailed art may bleed through plain paper heavily.That's honestly my only gripe about these pens.  They're very comfortable to hold obviously;  I did the shown artwork in only two long sittings.  There were some spots where the pens' balls would dry up, but a quick scribble on a scrap piece of paper was all it took to get them smoothly rolling ink out again.  I have to confess, I balked at the ""Glitter"" gel pens when I opened this set up, but as you can see in one of the photos, I wound up using the medium blue glitter pen for the water in my artwork and it gave my art a unique twist of detail!I really enjoyed doing the artwork I've shown with these pens.  I'll keep using this set for smaller doodles until all the pens are exhausted.  Then I'll be following the advice I gave earlier and will look for a bigger set of gel pens that have more ink for bigger artwork pieces.  But if you're just wanting these for smaller page adult coloring sheets, for small doodling or school use, these pens will work great for you!",4
B07R1WKMB3,"Nice colors and good flow of ink. I do adult art drawing and they are not top of the line, but are ok for basic work.",5
B07R1WKMB3,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Pros - bright and vivid colors, smooth flow of inkCons - grip not that comfortable, not meant for shadingThis basic set of gel pens is exactly what I wanted. I was tired of sharpening my colored pencils. The colors are very bright and vivid, which can be a pro unless you are more artistic and need to shade and other things true artists do. However, for me, this is sufficient to destress at the end of the day. I do wish the grip was better padded, but for the price point (got it on sale), I can't complain. Picture shows side by side of a picture done in colored pencil vs these gel pens. If these continue to work well, I may look for a larger pack with more colors/shades. I would rate this a 4.5 just because I wish the grip were softer. I would buy again!",4
B07R1WKMB3,I enjoying writing in my journals with these,5
B07R1WKMB3,10-Oct,5
B07R1WKMB3,I do a lot of coloring by myself and with my grandkids.  We love to make bookmarks using these pens and then laminate them.  Great little gifts- the pens and the bookmarks.,5
B07R1WKMB3,"When I received the pens I thought they worked awesome! Definitely the best gel pens I have gotten so far. I am most certainly buying more. Full coverage ,drys fast and no smudging .",5
B07R1WKMB3,"I have ordered these pens several times.  They are so nice for coloring.  They don't last as long as some others but for the price, they can't be beat!",5
B07R1WKMB3,"Nice gel pens for the price. Easy to use, very smooth, and nice vibrant colors. My daughter loves these to go along with the coloring book we ordered her",5
B07R1WKMB3,"My 7-year old daughter loves to color in the car but we often leave colors in the car, so this is an alternative to crayons that melt and markers that get on a lot of stuff. We keep these in the car and always have something to use.",4
B07R1WKMB3,"I bought these to use with some adult coloring books that were very detailed. Mostly, they work great and haven't bled through. Nice variety of colors. I especially like the glitter pens. The neon and pastel pens don't seem to have the best ink flow.",4
B07R1WKMB3,I absolutely love these to color with. I enjoy coloring to relax. These are so beautiful & vibrant plus they don't bleed through. I will continue to buy these when I need more.,5
B07R1WKMB3,"The colors of the glitter pens are pretty and worked well and I would have given a higher rating, however, there were only 23  pens not 24 as stated on the packaging.",3
B07R1WKMB3,"My wife's review: Really liked them. They bleed a little (some more than others) on the pages of the book I wanted them for. Also, have to be careful and let the ink dry.",4
B07R1WKMB3,Loved them,5
B07R1WKMB3,"OK, these were on sale for about half AND had a little coupon, so I paid about 48% of what they usually go for.  I paid about 8 bucks.  BUT doesn't matter WHAT something costs if you hate it, right?  It's NOT a deal then.As soon as I got these, I went through and TESTED every single one of them!Here is my experience:ALMOST all flowed smoothly and well.  A light blue and the red, didn't flow as well and seemed, if not dried out, not as free flowing.SOME of the colors, you can barely see.  I GET some are supposed to be lighter or more sheer, but it's like the Emperor's New Clothes, if I can't see it, for me, it's not THERE.OVERALL though, I have to give a five.  LOTS of colors and various finishes to choose from like matte, neon, pastel, metallic.  And really, any time I get a fairly good quantity of gel pens, a couple may not work quite as well as the rest, but they DID ALL work.I understand the frustration of those who had many that were dried out or didn't work to their satisfaction.  I don't know if it's a time thing, they're old, or, in my case, it's winter, so perhaps the cold affected some.  Maybe the few that didn't flow quite as well will warm up!IF, after using for some time, I find they dry out too fast or there is anything I don't like when doing a project, I SHALL update!FOR NOW, BOTTOMLINE:For the $8 and couple cents change (including my free shipping), GREAT deal.  I would likely have paid full price for these.  BUT if still on sale for about 8 bucks when you read this, I would say gave it try.  Your mileage may vary from mine, but mine was worth it.",5
B07R1WKMB3,Well the coor is vibrant and beautiful with a lot of color variety. The pens itself felt cheap and sometimes would just stop working. Aside from that I have loved them,3
B07R1WKMB3,About 3-4 pens the caps were broken. The pen still works but better packing should be used.,3
B07R1WKMB3,"Final Update & Thoughts/Found Errors:12/5/2020the darkest green pen has a navy blue ink in it, which i didnt notice until now. also, be aware that most of the solid color pens are not a full 1mm point, more like .5mm, all the glitters where thick at 1mm and flow fine so i didnt notice right away. i dont like a thin line at all bc its quite scratchy to write with and effects my ocd so 1 star off for the color mix up and quality inconsistencies, this might not bother you as much bc they dont do what is most important, which is they dont skip at all. be aware that not all the pens will be a thick line if you like any of the colors but the glitter ones, or tried to hunt down thick gel pens for hours like i did that didnt skip, otherwise colors are pretty and they all work. i just wouldnt get this set again and might stray towards the glitter ones instead to avoid the inconsistencies.Update:oct. 28, 2020lol blue, black, and purple glitter just ran out. they where the ones i used almost every day to write grocery lists and other lists so i guess ill just get the bigger set of glitter pens now i know i like themXD no clogs at all wiped the pen tip every time before i closed it back, respected the pen, and never had 1 issue.sep. 4th, 2020, original review:just tested the all and they are all so creamy and nice, with the glitter version being the smoothest. i only use gel pens with a broad tip (1mm) for ocd purposes, these write so smooth! they are also all assorted into groups that are listed on the package which i appreciated. i will rebuy only these from now on, life is just too short not to sign in glitter. I will update later especially if any skipping issues occur down the line, or oddities. so far, all smooth no skipping of any kind, just took a bit to get like two of the pens to start writing but they dont have any issues after starting.",4
B07R1WKMB3,"...although some of the colors are already running out after not much use. So far, I'm using them for my calendar entries.",3
B07R1WKMB3,Ink is dry on several pens don't color smooth.I'm going to purchase a couple more for gifts if there better I will update review.,3
B07R1WKMB3,I really love this,5
B07R1WKMB3,"What's to say other than I LOVE these pens! The only thing I don't know yet is if they actually last a while or not. But other than that, they flow well and are pretty.",4
B07R1WKMB3,"I was so happy to get these I tried them all immediately after opening the box.  These are very nice gel pens for coloring.  Smooth writing/coloring, vibrant colors, and the case is good for storing.  The caps on most of the pens are very close to the actual ink color.  And the 5 glitter pens write/draw smoothly leaving a nice glittery sheen.  I highly recommend these gel pens first artists of all, ages.p",5
B07R1WKMB3,"They were really smooth! Bright, bold colors. Would definitely purchase again!!",5
B07R1WKMB3,"I love using color gel pens for my journaling, card writing, wall calendars, coded lists, and more.  This was a fabulous pack at a great price. And, they work with even flow.  I'm glad I went for this large assortment and now just have the itsy problem of too much choice.  Ha!",5
B07R1WKMB3,"The colors are vibrant and they color/write very well. I wish it was more variety with the color selection because some colors seem to look the same with a small amount of differences in the shades, other than that my kids are enjoying them. They color with these pens and when I tell you the color lasts a good amount of time I am not exaggerating",5
B07R1WKMB3,My 89 year old aunt uses these pens in her adult coloring books. She enjoys the smooth flow of gel ink and the precision of the tips. There is no leakage and the durability is nice as some brands dry out.,5
B07R1WKMB3,"As a self proclaimed artist, I must say I'm glad the ink and marker colors are so vibrant, and long lasting.Works great for journaling and quick notes.",5
B07R1WKMB3,The pens work but the ink is only half way in the pen,4
B07R1WKMB3,Bought for my granddaughter whos.loves to drawValue.for money,5
B07R1WKMB3,Great set of pens works well,5
B07R1WKMB3,vibrant. ...dry fast.......always have them on hand..... my favorite,5
B07R1WKMB3,The gel pens are quite nice.  They have regular colors and sparkle colors.,5
B07R1WKMB3,The colors look nice and vibrant but it hasn't been used yet since it's a gift.I will update upon receiver getting the pens.,5
B07R1WKMB3,Cost was good fir the number of pens.  Pens are good quality also,4
B07R1WKMB3,"I got this set of pens to color with because my current pen set had dried up.  The ink flows from some of the colors more smoothly and thick, but I haven't had any of the colors skip.",5
B07R1WKMB3,Works great,5
B07R1WKMB3,Was really shocked at how good the quality of these pens are ! Super affordable and great quality,5
B07R1WKMB3,Would order again,5
B07R1WKMB3,"The gel pens are good, except I received a few in the pack that are dry.",4
B07R1WKMB3,"So far, I really like these.  Although I'm a self-confessed, former ink pen addict--and colored well but my twenties, well before adult coloring was fashionable--I've never colored with gel pens.  I bought this set for that purpose.  They flow nicely and haven't needed a lot of scribble priming.  I really love the few that are glitter colors.  So far, I've been using these as accents for coloring with my Castle Art soft core color pencils (120-count set), Castle Art Watercolor Pencils, Prismacolor Premiere (72-count set), and alcohol-based markers (Sharpie and Art 101).  As quickly as gel pens are used up, I can't afford to just color with gel pen (even though these are an incredible bargain at $7.99).  Like all gel pens, they take a bit of drying time, especially if you're a lefty.  These seem to be holding up well.  My only complaint is that a couple of my pens had a little less ink in them, but that is pretty common with pens.  They weren't drastically low.  I wish the pens were marked with a number for identifying purposes, like some colored pencils and markers.  I kept having an issue with these sliding out of place in their plastic case.  I have an injured hand, so for my sanity's sake, I put these in the canvas qianshan case also holds my soft Castle Art pencils.  They fit with two per band.  I that holding I see Aen Art has a big set glitter gel pens.  I might treat myself to a set some day.",4
B07R1WKMB3,He absolutely loved this. He was totally surprised when he opened this on his birthday.,5
B07R1WKMB3,Perfect,5
B07R1WKMB3,the pens are easy to use and very colorful.,5
B07R1WKMB3,These are ok but the lighter colors seem to fade after they dry. Like I have to go over the spot 4-5 times to get it to stay. I tore the flimsy plastic bag  (well the dog did jumping on it) so I can't return them either. Wouldn't recommend for anyone other than children.,2
B07R1WKMB3,The kids love the pens to color all projects,5
B07R1WKMB3,I am a glitter gel pen fanatic! This is one of my favorite brands! I have bought them numerous times and switched over to the largest pack. There are plenty of colors and they are nice and sparkly and NOT scratchy and dry. I love coloring with these! A must have for all glitter gel pen fans!,5
B07WNTQSC1,I like them a lot. They are very glittery. Just what I wanted. I added a picture to show it. They have a good grip and draw really nicely.,5
B07WNTQSC1,"Loving these colors vibrant, glittery and no bleed through. Nice flow, it does get lighter the longer you use it and it needs a scribble or shake.",4
B07WNTQSC1,"Love these! Alot of ink, beautiful colors, glide easy. Will be buying again!",5
B07WNTQSC1,The colors were so beautiful. My daughter loves them also! Easy to use and high quality markers!,5
B07WNTQSC1,"My mother is 93 and colors, does puzzles and reads books. She's very sharp mentally. She loved the pens I got her. They have glitter and it gives an extra dimension to her art. Thank you for making these great pens. When she runs out, and she will, we will definitely buy more.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"Assuming all of them actually work (two pens in my original set just flat-out will not write, despite my trying every trick in the book to fix the issue), I've gotta say i really enjoy these gel pens. I would have liked more blue shades, but it is what it is lol... the pens all write very well. They don't have any of the usual issue I've encountered with other gel pens brands, even expensive ones like Sakura Gelly Roll... these have a nice amount of glitter, the ink never comes out unevenly, never skips, and i was excited to discover that most of the neon colors are black-light responsive. These are great pens and definitely worth purchasing. The only reason I took a star away was because 2 pens didn't work. But obviously I liked them enough to buy a second time :-) I highly recommend!",4
B07WNTQSC1,This is one of my favorite packs of gel pens.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Nice glitter pens. Vibrant colors and glides nicely,5
B07WNTQSC1,I need more gel pens and decided to order these because of all the colors. Love the silver and the yellows.Lots of glitter! I use them for coloring small parts of mandalas and love how bright the colors are.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Perfect gift! Enough for the 2 kids to share!,5
B07WNTQSC1,I have been using these pens for EVERYTHING! Especially grading assignments and my own notes. The glitter is so pretty and the pens write so smooth.  Love them!,5
B07WNTQSC1,i love them,5
B07WNTQSC1,I love all the colors very shiny. Using for journaling. Have not tried all of them. Great value for quantity.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Love the colors. Bright and vibrant. Great for adult coloring. One problem 2 were broken.,4
B07WNTQSC1,Wide range of colors that are super vibrant and actually all different even though there are way more red shades. The glitter is like sparkles throughout rather than bigger pieces sprinkled in which I liked. Nice flow to pens.,5
B07WNTQSC1,The pens were good. I got the 32 set with glitter. Most of them work great but there were a few that seem to be kinda dried up or at least not wanting to write very well and a couple of them don't show up very well either but really they're still good pens because it was just a few that were bad. Also the glitter doesn't show too well in the picture but I promise they're glittery,5
B07WNTQSC1,Needs more glitter pens,4
B07WNTQSC1,There are good,5
B07WNTQSC1,She loves to draw anything or everyone.  It is an early Birthday present.,5
B07WNTQSC1,They worked just fine I would buy again,5
B07WNTQSC1,These are just fun and I love how smooth they write. And by write I mean color. Great for adult coloring books as they are fine tip,5
B07WNTQSC1,"I bought these glitter pens for four young girls, ages 3 to 10.  They squealed with delight when they opened the packages of pens. Over the last 6 months, every time I have visited them since I bought their pens, they go on and on about how beautiful the colors are and how much they love the pens. When one of the pens runs out of ink, they are so sad!!  I am buying more of these pens for the girls for Christmas and their birthdays.",5
B07WNTQSC1,wife loves it works like it should,4
B07WNTQSC1,"These were a gift for my 4 year old niece, she loves them!",4
B07WNTQSC1,I love the large assortment colors with just the right amount of glitter.,5
B07WNTQSC1,My 6 year old granddaughter absolutely loved these pens. They glide easily and have plenty of colors to use.,5
B07WNTQSC1,"art... Not Exactically Effective.. Jury Still out, (Medium Not Particularly Usefull at This Time...)",5
B07WNTQSC1,Granddaughter loves to doodle with these,5
B07WNTQSC1,Gave as gift and artist loved it.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Adult coloring books,5
B07WNTQSC1,Pen quality,5
B07WNTQSC1,The ink runs out smoothly and dry fast. The colors are good as well.,5
B07WNTQSC1,"todo muy bien, muchas gracias",5
B07WNTQSC1,kids love it,5
B07WNTQSC1,These pens are amazing.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Nice pens,5
B07WNTQSC1,"I plan on giving this as a gift this Christmas. There is quite the variety of colors in this set! This would make for a great gift for both young and older as long as they love coloring, drawing, or writing letters.",5
B07WNTQSC1,I like these gel pens a lot they are really nice and pretty colors.,5
B07WNTQSC1,These are very nicely and are very pretty!,5
B07WNTQSC1,Used these for our book signing. They made our names sparkle.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Just what my granddaughter wanted,5
B07WNTQSC1,"The pens are smooth and write well. However, my black pen came with only about a third of the ink the rest of my pens had. I'm not sure if that's intentional or not, but that's my only issue.",4
B07WNTQSC1,I love the amount of glitter there is in the ink,5
B07WNTQSC1,Great variety of colors,5
B07WNTQSC1,This is for a Christmas gift.  I am sure she will love it.,5
B07WNTQSC1,These pens are gorgeous. All the pens flow well and dry quickly.,5
B07WNTQSC1,"I ordered the 32 pen pack because of a recommendation from one of the comments. I want to say that I did test all the pens and they all work, they're all glittery and metallic and very pretty. They come in a nice pack with snaps on it to keep it closed. The colors are vibrant and bright, the pens are not filled to the exact completion but they're more than halfway filled almost to completion. I really don't use these type of things much so I'm not worried about them running out anytime soon. I just plan on using them and decorating stuff just writing on decorations.I like the price of the pens and I do think that they are worth the money and if you order these you will be very satisfied.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"Love the glitter, I use coloring books",5
B07WNTQSC1,These pens are great colors & comfortable to use.,5
B07WNTQSC1,"These write and flow effortlessly, love the feel,  super smooth and pretty colors and that's the sweet part.  The ink runs out so quickly,  however,  that one could go through an entire pen in a day and not even be a writer or journalist.  I know this because I bought them for use at work and I just write post it sized notes and circle and check things more or less and I've gone through an entire pen in a day before my day is even over, that's the short part. So, not very economical,  unfortunately.",4
B07WNTQSC1,The colors are beautiful and all different.  I thought there were two of each color but they are all different.  They look beautiful on paper and roll on so smooth.  I will get more when the ink runs out.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Nice true color. But was looking for a little more glitter for crafts. Still pretty good,4
B07WNTQSC1,Best glitter gel pens ever,5
B07WNTQSC1,Great colors,5
B07WNTQSC1,"the ink on these pens are beautiful! but if you do not hold them straight they will not write. Not horrible though, comparable to your run of the mill pens you get from the bank",4
B07WNTQSC1,Good quality and lasted a long time,5
B07WNTQSC1,"Good ink flow. Received set with two pens that did not work. Colors are nice, and ball size is okay, though finer nib would be better.",4
B07WNTQSC1,"I like these pens and variety of colors, the trouble is some of the pens don't work well and don't always write. But my 5 year old still enjoys drawing with them.",4
B07WNTQSC1,"The quality, quantity and price!",5
B07WNTQSC1,These are so pretty and work so good. Love all the colors and they last so long,5
B07WNTQSC1,What I don't like about the product is that I didn't see anything that indicated they were not all glitter so I was disappointed. I literally read: 36 GLITTER PENS! What I like about the product is that the colors are vibrant.,3
B07WNTQSC1,My granddaughter loves them,5
B07WNTQSC1,I needed glitter pens that were fine tipped as well as being able to fill spaces.  So these are great for outlining and coloring in where needed.  And no smearing!  A very clean and colorful outcome.  Will buy more.,5
B07WNTQSC1,The pens were delivered just themselves with a big label stuck to the plastic film.,3
B07WNTQSC1,Good and as described,4
B07WNTQSC1,"Bought these as a gift for my niece and she absolutely loved them. There are so many colors to choose from and the colors come out very bright and vivid. They are fine tipped as described, but a good amount of ink still comes out. I can't tell you how long they last, but their claim to have 40% more ink in them seems to be accurate.No cons come to mind with these. The price is reasonable and the quality is high. Would recommend.",5
B07WNTQSC1,They were what they said and work fine,5
B07WNTQSC1,Working at a resident Memory Care Facility and the Glitter Pens are greatly appreciated by the women and men living here! Thank you,5
B07WNTQSC1,Excellent,5
B07WNTQSC1,Perfectly splendid,5
B07WNTQSC1,"Overall I like these pens. There are lots of colors and the ink is good. I was concerned because some of the reviews said some of the pens didn't have ink, and though it is reasonable to expect ALL of the pens to have ink, I can live with just one of them not working. I just got them so I will update the review later after I see how long the ink lasts.",4
B07WNTQSC1,I found they were just ok.,4
B07WNTQSC1,Nice collection of colors. Very bright with sparkle that pops off the page. I love the way the pens glide over the paper.,5
B07WNTQSC1,Not much ink,3
B07WNTQSC1,Great quality pens,5
B07WNTQSC1,"I love to use glitter pens on my craft projects and these are very nice.  I like the assortment of colors, they go on well and the ink runs smooth, unlike some gel pens that only work for a few minutes and then quit. I recommend these as they work well and the colors are nice, vibrant and glittery.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"I forgot to take a picture, these were purchased for a Birthday present for one of my daughter's friends. We didn't get to test the quality of the pens unfortunately, but my daughter now wants a set as well so we will likely be purchasing again. If we do, I will update my review to reflect the actual usage of the pens.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"Great quality for what you spend. They color smoothly, quick to dry so no smearing. Nice arrange of colors and tons of sparkle. I liked them so much that I bought another set and a set for someone else.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"They are fine point, so filling in spaces takes a little work, but it's worth it!",5
B07WNTQSC1,100 year old Grandmother LOVED IT!!,5
B07WNTQSC1,Not much glitter shows up and had one pen that I had to heat up to get the ink out.  Colors are very similar to each other.  I thought the colors would be deeper but petty light.  Pen point is pretty small.,3
B07WNTQSC1,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This review is for Taotree 32 Neon Glitter Gel Pens.Cons: Many of the caps don't match the colors. There are about 5 true neon pens in this pack. Pros: All pens have decent flow, with minimal ink skipping.",4
B07WNTQSC1,I like them a lot. They are very glittery. Just what I wanted. I added a picture to show it. They have a good grip and draw really nicely.,5

We didn't get to test the quality of the pens unfortunately, but my daughter now wants a set as well so we will likely be purchasing again. If we do, I will update my review to reflect the actual usage of the pens.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"Great quality for what you spend. They color smoothly, quick to dry so no smearing. Nice arrange of colors and tons of sparkle. I liked them so much that I bought another set and a set for someone else.",5
B07WNTQSC1,"They are fine point, so filling in spaces takes a little work, but it's worth it!",5
B07WNTQSC1,100 year old Grandmother LOVED IT!!,5
B07WNTQSC1,Not much glitter shows up and had one pen that I had to heat up to get the ink out.  Colors are very similar to each other.  I thought the colors would be deeper but petty light.  Pen point is pretty small.,3
B07WNTQSC1,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This review is for Taotree 32 Neon Glitter Gel Pens.Cons: Many of the caps don't match the colors. There are about 5 true neon pens in this pack. Pros: All pens have decent flow, with minimal ink skipping.",4
B09CKXJFL1,"I am not an artist but do like painting (by number!).  I have decided that a neck ache is not worth the painting time so I decided to invest in an easel.  This one is absolutely perfect.  It is very portable and folds up nicely as you can see in the first photo.  There is also a carrying case which makes it convenient for traveling or storing away.  The height can be adjusted so you can be comfortable either sitting or standing.  It comes already assembled with the exception of the tray which simply pops onto the easel frame. The tray is used to hold your paints, rags, brushes, etc.  I particularly like the fact that there is a level on the easel which helps if you decide to go outside.  Additionally, the ""feet"" on the legs adjust to the angle of the ground without you having to do anything. Vey convenient. The material of the stand is a light metal and when set up and locked, it is very sturdy.  I will be using only indoors but I can see how convenient it would be outside, as well.  Keep in mind that this frame is relatively lightweight so be cognizant, if you paint outside, of any wind that may tip it over.  I'm very pleased and would recommend this easel, especially for the quasi-painter, such as myself.",5
B09CKXJFL1,"So, I bought an LED Glass chalkboard in lieu of buying an electronic LED scrolling board to advertise my product and side hustle. I needed something to stand it on safely, so I purchased this easel.Here's what I'll tell you. It's good. It works. It's easy to set up, despite the instructions. It will work for my purpose. However, for me there a lot of things that I must remember when using it. Remember...these are MY guidelines for using the easel.1) Use it just for display. Do my artwork on a solid, flat surface before putting it on the easel.2) Do not extend legs fully. It looks like the bottom third of the easel...the skinniest legs, are not very sturdy and bend fairly easy. Only extend the first two sections of the legs.This might be good for actual painting, because it usually just requires a light tough. For anything heavier than that, take caution OR maybe get something more solid.You get what you pay for.",4
B09CKXJFL1,Good Easel. Light weight but sturdy.  easy to use,5
B09CKXJFL1,This easel is perfect for display of foam core graphics at a hight somewhat above table top level.  The carrying case included makes it a convenient for traveling presenters.  Black color subdues its presence.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"We bought this for our granddaughter who is becoming interested in painting.  The easel is sturdy and well designed.  It's pretty simple to put together although I was glad for the included instructions with photos.  The leg extensions are infinitely adjustable and clip securely at the desired height, although the leg tops don't lock into their spread position so if a person or dog bumps into the base of a leg there may be a tipover risk.  There is a good bottom ledge with an anti-skid rim, and a good top support for a rigidly framed canvas or board, but some kind of backboard and separate clips will be needed to hold anything flexible like posterboard.  No shelf is provided to hold paint pots, palette, etc.",5
B09CKXJFL1,"It does the job. Isn't very stable and takes practice to get it just right, but the customizable leg lengths makes it work well on uneven surfaces. Smaller canvases will need a backer of some kind behind it. Maybe don't use for outside events without anchoring, or only use on a still day.",3
B09CKXJFL1,"By the way! I saw tripod hamock weights in the recommendations to go with this - seems like a great idea to put paints and brushes in, and would help weigh down this /extremely/ lightweight easel. I'd also recommend a camping/gardening stool and something to set more supplies on, if you're doing en plein air. Also, try finding a way to attach a paper towel for excess paint on your brushes. I've found I can rest a ruler on the lower hook-things for that. Wowzers will this easel let me just stroll through the park with only a bag of supplies, see some cool sunlight action on whatever plant, and just sit down to paint. It can go small, too, so you could just set it on a desk if you like. Then you could set all your stuff at arm's reach.For an actual review: Like I said, it's extremely lightweight. It seems sturdy enough; I'm just not so sure it would still stand straight if you whacked it against a boulder. Don't whack your gear into boulders. Anyway, for normal use, indoor and occasional outdoor, I suspect this will last me many years if I'm careful. The clasps may be a little delicate, like they'd be the first to break if you whacked it against a boulder. Ooh, another thing: I love how cleanable it looks. All surfaces are smooth, so I don't think I'll need to tape it up as I've done with my wooden board (that's more of a drawing surface, really). And the whole thing is extremely adjustable. And I love the carrying bag and the extra pieces just in case the small bits get lost. (Please be careful, those small bits may fall out if you unscrew the brackets too far.) Anyway, product seems neat. I'm very happy with it. I'll update my review if it ever breaks. With luck, I'll never need to. I don't whack my gear into boulders.",5
B09CKXJFL1,Inexpensive and lightweight. I am taking a drawing class and it fits my 23 by 26 drawing board easily. it also sets up and folds down in seconds with no pinched fingers.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"Pros: Great product for light travel, easily adjustable to many different heights (about as tall as me at tallest and I'm 5'3), packaged very well and easy to put together.Cons: Definitely not going to be good for windy days outside (it's as light as a bird), loose threads on eisel strap, no extra pocket for extra pieces and storage bag strap is pretty tight as it's longest length on shoulder (definitely no crossbody carrying unless you are a kid).",4
B09CKXJFL1,It's very lightweight which is nice for traveling.,4
B09CKXJFL1,"Some art paintings easy installation, lightweight",4
B09CKXJFL1,I love this easel. Very light. It will hold my pre stretch canvas at just the right height. Very happy with my purchase and time it took to ship it.,5
B09CKXJFL1,Great buy.  Will be able to use when painting or for display on shelf.,5
B09CKXJFL1,This was a gift for a client and she is very happy with it.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"Great light weight, portable easel. A real bargain for the price.",5
B09CKXJFL1,"It's a nice easel, a lot difficult to assemble and the legs are a little wobbly. My daughter loves it and that's what matters. It's lightweight and the height is adjustable which is nice.",4
B09CKXJFL1,How easily it adjusts from a table easel to a standing easel. How easily it adapts to different canvas sizes. How easily it folds up into a small travel bag.,5
B09CKXJFL1,Adjusts well and is a good height when opened as far as it will go. Nice and light too.,5
B09CKXJFL1,My granddaughter loves the easel and is just the right size for a young child. Definitely would recommend it.,4
B09CKXJFL1,Functional good quality for the price,5
B09CKXJFL1,Functionality appears good.  Good value to help support our youngest painter,4
B09CKXJFL1,Nothing wrong with item except my wife wanted something else.,5
B09CKXJFL1,Very easy to assemble. Like that it has a case to put it in when not in use.,5
B09CKXJFL1,It's Very lightweight and simple to use.  Easy to use.My daughter got this for me for Christmas.  She knows that I am planning on doing some traveling and artwork,5
B09CKXJFL1,easy to set up worked fine,5
B09CKXJFL1,"Very good material, very good size, easy to assemble and you can adjust it to the size of the canvas",5
B09CKXJFL1,Speaks for itself good product,5
B09CKXJFL1,Fixed in just a little time,5
B09CKXJFL1,"For the price, can't complain!",5
B09CKXJFL1,Works fine. Buy it.,5
B09CKXJFL1,I like that you can adjust the legs for height or for table top use.  I set up a mini craft and art studio in a corner of my garage.  I'm planning on doing a vision board and was gifted some paint on canvas projects.  This will be perfect for that!,5
B09CKXJFL1,Works great for sharing information during virtual meetings.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"As described, lightweight",5
B09CKXJFL1,"This is a nice setup at least for someone like me (a super casual painter who is just learning). The stand is pretty versatile on setting up and being able to change the length on each leg for leveling. The one thing that is a bit of an issue (and may be an issue even for large wooden easels) is that once a canvas is attached, the easel can be blown over with a not very strong breeze so I try to sit with my feet wrapped around one of the legs to avoid that issue when outside.",4
B09CKXJFL1,Not as sturdy as I would have liked but easy to assemble & will hold a large canvas.,4
B09CKXJFL1,"So if you are looking at this, it says it's for painting, as in, it's not just a stand. You can actually paint with it. So I bought this to paint with, not just to use as a stand.Instructions were pretty simple, setup is pretty easy. I paint a lot of 18x24, 9x12, etc, so they all work. You just have to adjust the two sliding holders to the height you need and it locks down pretty well to almost any size you want.Only thing I don't like is that when I am doing a 36x48 portrait, this just doesn't fit at all and it is not very sturdy. It moves a lot.The reason for this is the metal piece that you attach at the bottom is only so wide, which means the front two legs can only be so wide, so instead of VERY WIDE like with a smaller painting, the larger canvases will give you some issue because the front legs are forced to be so close together. This makes the canvas pretty shaky.So make sure whatever one you get will easily accommodate whatever canvas you bought. I very well might have bought one which doesn't accommodate the larger portrait 36x48 canvas. I am not sure. I got the size I thought was applicable.Be that as it may, the metal base holder does bend when you lock a canvas down, which is a little bit on the flimsy side. I tried tightening it down with the screws provided, but that didn't help at all. So now it's sort of bent down at a weird angle. It still holds, but it looks cheaply made. I am not sure how long it will last.Overall, it's a simple design, telescoping, which is nice, but just a little less sturdy than I had anticipated.If you aren't doing large canvas paintings (over 36"" on either side) then this should work for you just fine.",4
B09CKXJFL1,"Wonderful product ,Great size and quality",5
B09CKXJFL1,It's just a bit small for getting it all back in without threatening the zipper...;),4
B09CKXJFL1,Not too sturdy.  You need to hold the whiteboard if you are drawing on it with this easel,3
B09CKXJFL1,The quickness of delivery and quality of the product,5
B09CKXJFL1,"The zipper was broken but other than that, great product.",4
B09CKXJFL1,A well-made and sturdy easel.,5
B09CKXJFL1,wish it could be lowered a bit,4
B09CKXJFL1,Alot of adjustment.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"Before I ordered it, I was in dilemma because of some bad review saying the product is unstable. But trust me this one is very stable and who would believe that  I only had to spend 15$ for this amazing stuff.",5
B09CKXJFL1,Compact,5
B09CKXJFL1,This will hold a lot of different sized canvases.,5
B09CKXJFL1,My daughter loved it!,5
B09CKXJFL1,Love the stand and how it's adjustable.  Works well for my needs and the price was great comparatively,5
B09CKXJFL1,It's just the right size for my granddaughter and easily assembled.,5
B09CKXJFL1,I thought this easel was satisfactory but my art teacher was not a fan. It was stable with a block of wood behind it . I like it and it serves the purpose to use on my table.,4
B09CKXJFL1,Easy to use and quick setup for traveling,4
B09CKXJFL1,loved it,5
B09CKXJFL1,Nice quality,5
B09CKXJFL1,My wife got into painting so I bought this as an early Christmas present.  She loves everything about it. Zero complaints.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"Was all that I expected, recommend to others.This order was all that Iexpected and more.",5
B09CKXJFL1,"Nice & light, and easy to maneuver - also feels pretty sturdy.",5
B09CKXJFL1,I bought to display a white board for work.  This has been great.  Easy to adjust height and easily stored away when not using.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"4.5 stars. Good tabletop easel, but I would not count on it as a fully extended one. Maybe OK if you are 5 ft tall. I'm 6 ft and  a 12x18 canvas or panel is at my belly height.",4
B09CKXJFL1,Better than expected,5
B09CKXJFL1,Nice,5
B09CKXJFL1,Strong built easy set up compact with carry case love it,5
B09CKXJFL1,"I bought this easel for my mom and dad who have decided for their 60th wedding anniversary that they want to paint Bob Ross paintings. They wanted to be able to sit at the table and be comfortable rather than having a standing easel. I saw this item on Amazon and it looked like it would be good for sitting or standing. It folds compactly, has a really neat spring-loaded, capture arm to hold the canvas at the top and it even has tiny little adjustable feet that can be manipulated for an uneven surface. The only thing I think I would do differently would be to add a tiny little rubber disc to the bottom of each of the feet for use on a slick table top. My parents mentioned how pleased they were.",5
B09CKXJFL1,"I got these to display my artwork outside at festivals and parties, and to do light painting at home.. They work very well. Outside you ""must"" stake down the 3rd leg or any breeze will collapse this. Preferable stake down all 3 legs. Painting on it at home works so long as you do not push down on it much otherwise it will collapse. The bar that the canvas sits on can easily scuff up your paint as well as the bar that holds the painting at the top.. I use a couple shop towels for the bottom and fold one for the top so my paint does not get damaged. Otherwise this does as it is advertised.  Have had no issues with the clips that keep the legs extended, but if I do I will just drill a hole under them and put in a screw.",5
B09CKXJFL1,The versatility of this easel is great! I use on a table top as well as from the floor and the adjustments are easily made. Would recommend.,5
B09CKXJFL1,"Update: I found that tightening all the screws holding it together made using it a much more usable. Changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars.Original review: This is not a very stable tripod and not good for anything other than maybe displaying a small canvas. It's awkward to put together and the back ""leg"" just kinda flops, no stability to it. Don't waste your money on this one.",3
B09CKXJFL1,I am very happy with the product.,5
B09CKXJFL1,Awesome stand for beginners. It can hold canvas of all sizes. Missing cup holder though,4
B09CKXJFL1,This easel is sturdy and great for the value. Easy to set up as well. Would make a great gift for the painter in your life.,4
B09CKXJFL1,"This is a nice easel for a good price.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would have liked it to have a cup holder on the side for water.  I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it but she constantly has to turn around to the table to wash her brush out.  Other than that, it works well, stays standing, and has a nice little bag that it can fit in for storage.",4
B09CKXJFL1,"Praise for the company that makes this easel...Below you'll find the original review of the easel. What you don't see is that the company was kind and professional enough to contact me and gave me a full refund. I can't tell you how much of a breath of fresh air this was - totally not expected but completely appreciated.Since they stand behind their products I'll certainly give the company and their products another try. Kudos to the way this was handled!Light weight, very easy to assemble but VERY unstable. I actually looked to make certain I'd not missed some part of the easel once I had it together and standing up - unfortunately, I hadn't. I knew it would have to be 'babied' but I decided to try and use it anyway. Almost big mistake.I took it to the gallery my art is hung at to do a live painting and it nearly tipped over as soon as I placed the canvas on it. At one point I glanced into it with my foot (not hard at all) and it fell over - thank goodness the painting was already dry.I figured out how to brace the three legs with a makeshift wedge but I'm ordering another easel because unless it's at the lowest size possible, it's too unstable. Since I work from home I'll use it as a table top easel but NEVER for a show.Also, the velcro strap that secures the bottom canvas support isn't long enough to go around the legs and fasten - so it's useless.",3
B09CKXJFL1,Only thing I'm unsatisfied with the legs some extend farther than the other,4
B09CKXJFL1,"This is really the coolest, most versital easel! There's a hook in the bottom of it to hang a weight to stablalize it when the legs are extended.",5
B09CKXJFL1,Easy to set up and easy to use.,4
B09CKXJFL1,"Nothing,  it's fine",5
B09CKXJFL1,"Quality is not the best but gets the job done. It fits a large range of sizes but when you use the clamps to fix it in place, there are some small dents. Overall fair value for the money",4
B09CKXJFL1,"May need weighted down to use for plein aire painting. Also, no bracket to hold back leg out. Still, very light and affordable.",4
B09CKXJFL1,"As the title states, it's exactly what I needed! I only wish there was a way to attach a light to the top. It even comes with a nice carry case.",5
B09CKXJFL1,Worked fine during my granddaughter's visit.,4
B09CKXJFL1,"What I like about this feather light weight easel the RRFTOK Metal Tripod Adjustable Easel:  I love to paint on locations outdoors, a genre in art known as Plein Air painting.  This has a nice zipper pouch with a strap for carrying it, and would not be a burden.  It is built well and would meet the requirements necessary to paint on site, indoors or outdoors.  Con: It would be unfair of me to make an evaluation based on the plastic locking clips that keep the legs extended.  Why?  I live in the high desert, here plastic parts are famous for early decomposition and breakage.  That would not be the case where there is a more balanced humidity/arid climate, it would have the manufacturers longevity design.",5
B09CKXJFL1,The easel is light and ment for medium to small artwork.Economically priced for what it is.,3
B09CKXJFL1,Needed a couple of these to display photos at a Celebration of Life.  They are lightweight (but I believe advertised that way) and did the job although there were no young children around.,4
B09CKXJFL1,"I used this fully extended for demonstrating at a paint party.  It was kind of wobbly at full extension.  That being said, I taped my canvas to it so it was easy to pick the whole thing up to show my guests a closer view of my painting.",4
B09CKXJFL1,Great little stands.,5
B09CKXJFL1,Easy to set up and to store. You can place it on a table top or the ground. You can use large or small canvases. I recommend this easel.,5
B086JDDS32,"I used oil based stain, water based stain, polycoat and craft paint with these. They work so well, very durable and good for single use projects where you're better off trashing the brush than trying to clean it, like oil based stain. Great price, I've used a couple of each sie to stain my floors in my closet, do trim stain, touch up my white closet cabinets. They didn't fall apart and absorbed the paint/stain very well but didn't clump, get messy or dry out too fast.",5
B086JDDS32,"These are awesome sponge brushes. Each one holds up well and is a perfect width for painting cabinets. I did my whole kitchen and loved using these. I did wash them out from time to time, which was easy, but I used a lot of them once and then threw them away. These sponges are not meant to be used over and over again. They do wear out after a good period of use. They put on paint smoothly and gently, though. They fit into the mouth of a quart size can to pick up paint.",5
B086JDDS32,A good brush for general purpose painting or spreading of product.,4
B086JDDS32,Good price. These are the same quality as any other store.,5
B086JDDS32,I purchased those for my daughter's birthday paint party. They served their purpose. I washed them after the party and can be reused.,5
B086JDDS32,Value for money,3
B086JDDS32,Nice finish! I pay at Lowes .98 cents each same brush!,5
B086JDDS32,"They are .15 for a reason. If you need something for small jobs where the clean up takes longer than the project, this is it. I did have some of the brush heads fall off using oil based primer but the seller took care of me.",4
B086JDDS32,These fall apart easily. Would not buy again,5
B086JDDS32,Great product in a large quantity,5
B086JDDS32,Used these for Paint and stain and everything. Was good.,4
B086JDDS32,"I needed these brushes to stain the wooden slats on my deck. They look and feel great, however, I noticed that 5 of them were dirty. I took a picture of the worst one. It may not matter to most but it could really mess up a delicate project if you introduced a dirty brush into it. I wanted to take off 2 stars but they really are good little foam brushes. I just wish all of them were clean. They don't have to be perfect but this one looked like someone stepped on it with dirty shoes.",4
B086JDDS32,I have bought many foam brushes; the price and quality of the Bates- Foam Paint Brushes and its assortment of different sizes is just right! I would order them again in a heartbeat.,5
B086JDDS32,When you come across a smudge on the wall that wont wipe off these sponge brushes are great to have on hand. Dip in the paint fix the smudge and toss the sponge brush away.,5
B086JDDS32,My go-to brush for odd small projects around the house.,5
B086JDDS32,Staining craft items,5
B086JDDS32,"I like to keep these around for when I need touch up paint on walls and small projects. While these do the job, the sponges came off the stick easily. I was able to use them, just had to be careful.Update-changed my review from 3 stars to 5 stars after the seller reached out to see if they could make things right with me.  Although the item is not expensive, I appreciate that they cared about my experience and wanted me satisfied.",5
B086JDDS32,"I used this with rit dye to paint a pretty large project. After about 30-45 minutes of continuous use, the foam would detach from the handle. Reattaching the foam to the handle didn't make a difference because it would not stay on enough to use without falling off again. Glad the bag had plenty. I sure went through a few. Did not try with paint on a canvas. Maybe the results would have been different.",4
B086JDDS32,Good deal,5
B086JDDS32,Love so many of the smaller brushes. Will have them for awhile and very handy for many uses.,5
B086JDDS32,First foam brush i have used that does not fall apart in then strokes,5
B086JDDS32,This arrived on time for me to use it to help seal my teak furniture. Extremely helpful on the  chairs . Gave a nice smooth coat at the end.,5
B086JDDS32,I use these for applying poly urethane on finished wood products.  If you are planning on putting more than one coat and choose to not clean a brush this product makes perfect sense.  I have used these numerous times and have finally found an offering that allows me to get a decent quantity of one size without having to get the dreaded assortment.,5
B086JDDS32,"I use these foam brushes all the time and get a nice finish with paint, poly, and varnish.These brushes have a nice dense foam that allows me to lay down a smooth coat.",5
B086JDDS32,Great product good shipping,5
B086JDDS32,Used these to apply polyurethane to my table. Great price for multiple sponge brushes,5
B086JDDS32,"Im a terrible painter, these sponge brushes are wonderful, they make the job very easy. Give than a try.",5
B086JDDS32,I bought these to use staining my two adirondack chairs and they worked perfectly. You get a lot of them and I still have most of them post completion of the job. The foam is well connected to the wooden dowel handles and the foam itself held up better than expected during the job. It didn't self destruct or come apart during use which made me very happy. I would choose this brand again but likely won't have to because I still have several left.,5
B086JDDS32,"Love the quantity. Don't have to run out for a brush in last minute decision, .",5
B086JDDS32,I got these to help with a mod podge project I was doing with my grandkids. These were great. After we finished I washed the three used brushes off and they will be good to go for a second use. These were a good buy.,5
B086JDDS32,"They work fine but the applicator portion is a bit long however, that's personnal preference.",4
B086JDDS32,Was surprised on now well they worked compared to using a brush. Used them to Apply block sealer and they worked like a charm. Two thumbs up,5
B086JDDS32,"better priced than the Depot.  I use these for all my stains, paints and final coats in woodworking.  Great for 1 time use.  If I want multiple uses I buy high quality brushes not foam.",5
B086JDDS32,Needed a wide foam brush for teak oil application. Not glamorous but these brushes worked great and for about a 1/3 of the price of a home depot brand.,5
B086JDDS32,"I refinish furniture for a living and I've tried quite a few foam brushes. These are surprisingly very strong, durable and good.",5
B086JDDS32,"Theses foam sponges are good quality and work well for the price, but as other reviews pointed out the foam sponges do come off rather easily after verify little use. I end up having to use a little bit of super glue to put them back on. Once I do that they stay on much better.",4
B086JDDS32,"great brush, the wooden stick won't break while applying paint on surface. good quality, smooth.",5
B086JDDS32,Great transaction great product,5
B086JDDS32,"I needed foam brushes for staining and the price at my local Big Blue Home center was way too high for a single brush so I checked on Amazon and found the Bates brushes for considerably less money.The brushes arrived in a box but, when I opened it I found several of the foam tips were deformed, which is why I deducted one star from the rating. Since I was using an oil-based stain there was no way to clean them in solvent without destroying them. But, they could be cleaned and reused if using a water-based paint or stain/polyurethane product.",4
B086JDDS32,Great paint brushes! I used these to repaint cabinets and they turned out great.,5
B086JDDS32,better and faster than some brushes,5
B086JDDS32,"Recently bought this multi pack of foam brushes for a interior painting project, the brushes are of good quality and a great value",5
B086JDDS32,These are really inexpensive and when done you can just throw them away.,5
B086JDDS32,Used for house touchups and some refinishing.,5
B086JDDS32,"A good amount of decent quality brushes at a very fair price.  Foam density stood up to some pretty ugly and rough wood without completely shredding.  Foam isn't too dense or too soft, just right and enjoy the blue color compared to the normal black.  Size is what it is, but it's nice to have the option and sometimes I just rip them off the stick and use them with my hands after folding in half or whatever.  As far as foam brushes go these are pretty much as good as they need to be to get the job done so no complaints, would buy again.",5
B086JDDS32,Great,5
B086JDDS32,"I gave these 5 stars but, I want to give them a ""10"". I generally go through these types of sponge brushes like tissues. I'm here to tell you these are THE BEST ones I have ever had. They are strong and stay together. They wash up great. The price is perfect! A really great product!!",5
B086JDDS32,"So far, I have used them only with oil based products.",4
B086JDDS32,I tried putting spar varnish on my table with a brush.  Followed all the on-line advice regarding application technique.  The results were mediocre at best.  I switched to these foam brushes and got great results.I rated the ease to clean at 5 stars because they are so inexpensive that I don't do any cleaning - I just toss them after 1 use (after I let them dry out).  Durability also good as they do not have small bits and pieces crumbling off as you use them.,5
B086JDDS32,"I used these brushes (one per coat) to apply poly to some stained wood shelves and they worked great! Don't press too hard, or the foam will make bubbles in the poly, but with nice gentle strokes I got a very smooth finish. No issues with the brushes at all.",5
B086JDDS32,Different sizes for different projects. These are great for light projects then throw away although they can be washed out and reused but they are not made for multiple uses requiring hours and hours of work as the foam will either fall off the stick or it'll start breaking down.PRO TIP: I've cut the foam vertically to paint a slimmer line and to get in difficult tight spots.,5
B086JDDS32,"These are great as disposable brushes. I can usually get two or three uses out of each brush  (if I wrap them up) when laying polyurethane.  These are a better quality of foam brush than what I typically see in big box stores, and I don't feel guilty using it once and throwing it away.Inner core keeps the brush stable, and they hold up well with a variety of applications.  I've used them with polyurethane, unicorn spit, acrylic paint, stain and not had any issues.I usually order in 1 inch and 3 inch sizes to keep on hand.  The only ""slightly"" annoying part is they arrive in a large flat package with a pocketed wrapper, versus stacked together in a bag like some other brush suppliers.",5
B086JDDS32,These are every bit as good as the big box foam brushes at a fraction of the price.  I use them for staining projects and they are so cheap I don't bother trying to clean them.,5
B086JDDS32,"Good for dry projects or where you're lightly touching up, but once it's wet or saturated, it's limp.  You're basically painting with the stick the foam is attached to, but if you've used foam applicators before there is nothing new. I did leave a lesser rating and the seller reached out offering a full refund. I thought about it and I was a bit harsh the first time around. I refused the refund because they did work for my project and I still have a bunch left over. They will get used and are similar to other foam brushes-applicators I've worked with in the past and for the low price I wasn't expecting anything different.",4
B086JDDS32,Variety pack.  Affordable.,5
B086JDDS32,Good brushes I have the same one multiple times with washing in between and it has held together,4
B086JDDS32,Great for the little jobs one at a time very good dependable brushes with outstanding cost very straight,5
B086JDDS32,"I use these routinely when a touch-up on the hose or trim is needed.  Much more convenient than getting a brush out and having to clean it for a small job.  These work great, smoothly spread the paint (or stain) and make it an easy clean-up.  I recommend.",5
B086JDDS32,"Good quality, I would definitely buy again.",5
B086JDDS32,I love these foam brushes. I use them every time I apply a stain or varnish to my wood projects. They help reduce bubbles and they're better than cloth rags because they don't leave little pieces of thread. I prefer to use these instead of brushes because I can just toss them when I'm done. It's also a lot better to buy them like this compared to Home Depot or other stores than sell them individually. It saves you a lot of money. I will continue to buy these in bulk.,5
B086JDDS32,great for spreading stain or oil finishes. Good price.,4
B086JDDS32,All foam brushes are flemsy and so are these but you get several and was best deal for what was offered on Amazon at time of purchase feel they are overpriced,5
B086JDDS32,Just what I needed for my project!,4
B086JDDS32,Just what I needed for painting craft products! Good price!,5
B086JDDS32,these cannot be reused ; i painted furniture,4
B086JDDS32,"same or better quality than big-box stores, better price, and nice to get so many, always ready for the next project",5
B086JDDS32,Good price but the sponge pulls away from the handle after a while and then becomes difficult to use',3
B086JDDS32,Used it for pasting a 500 piece puzzle together. Worked wonderfully with the glue and washed off nicely.  Brings plenty of brushes in case you need for different things.  The size of the brushes were convenient as well. Overall good product.,5
B086JDDS32,"I'm currently re-staining my stair handrails and posts.  From experience I find these brushes work best for this kind of project. They leave no brush marks for a smooth finish.  They are cheap enough to throw away after use, but with water-based clear coats they can be easily cleaned with soap and water for re-use.  I like to keep a supply on hand so I ordered this bundle at a reasonable price.",5
B086JDDS32,They are ok if you didn't need them cut in straight lines on the end of the sponge. Will not buy again,4
B086JDDS32,"I found these to be a much better product that the ones I have bought at the big box stores... The sponge does not come off like the grey ones I have used. I recc getting the bigger size you use most, knowing they can be cut down easily with scissors.",5
B086JDDS32,"I use these brushes to apply clear sealers, stain, mod podge and some paints to avoid ruining my good paint brushes. They are inexpensive and disposable",5
B086JDDS32,I painted a book shelf for the first time and these paint brushes were amazing.,5
B086JDDS32,"I have yet to find a good foam brush that holds up. I got these for the value, but had to use several for one project as they seem to come apart from the handle very easily. I use these as throw away when using oil based products so that I don't have to use my good paint brushes, but it just really irritates me when they fall apart in the middle of a project.",3
B086JDDS32,"They're cheap and disposable, that's what they're made for and they do the job well. They get in those corners and crevices like no other.",5
B086JDDS32,I have bought some from local chain hardware store. The foam was flimsy and broke off after few uses. This one is different. The foam is much more sturdier and you can use it again and again. This set will last me a long time!,5
B086JDDS32,I think they are very good at least for me I only paint scratches in the apartment and they are perfect for that,5
B086JDDS32,"I bought these brushes since I wanted to have a few for a project that I could just throw away and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of them for the price.I used them to use modge podge on a gym water bottle I use to keep stickers down and I found that they had a good bit of flex in the handle and I didn't mange to break them in half like I have done with countless other cheap, craft store ones.A big highlight is the sponge didn't disintegrate with a few washes, so really you could keep these for a few projects instead of just tossing like I did after I was done.I'd definitely recommend these again for the price.",4
B086JDDS32,Good value for the quantity. Typical brush but didn't leave behind any brush strokes.,5
B086JDDS32,"I bought these brushes to use while refinishing some dressers. It applied the wood stain with an old t shirt, but applied the water based polyurethane finish using these brushes. I was nervous because some people said that using foam brushes with water based poly leaves bubbles and streaks, but these worked great for me. I just went slow and worked in patches.10/10 for me",5
B086JDDS32,"They work great for dusting. They can get in just about any crevice. I clean my PC fan blades with them. As far as for painting, I don't know the quality.",5
B086JDDS32,"Seems ok for price, not as high quality as ones at mass retailer",3
B086JDDS32,Good product. Good price,5
B086JDDS32,I bought these to apply sealer to my newly tiled shower. It worked well.,5
B086PMM18D,"My kids haven't quite gotten the hang of not pressing the pencils so hard, so they frequently need resharpening. This sharpener makes it all a non-issue, and even freshens up colored pencils.If I had one gripe, a weighted bottom would have been ideal, but it still does a great job.",5
B086PMM18D,"This pencil sharpener is compact, easy to use and does a nice job. It is electric, so needs to be plugged in.",5
B086PMM18D,"Pencils.  We who grew up in the pre-computer era likely when through hundreds of them throughout our academic careers, and they're still in popular use, though not AS common, certainly.When I was a kid, buying school supplies meant getting a box of #2 pencils, and every classroom had a mechanical pencil sharpener screwed to the wall somewhere.  (Of course, this was before, and just shortly after Jimmy Carter created the Department of Education, and the resultant drastic decrease in scholastic performance, nationwide, which it brought along with it.)Pencil sharpening was a daily... often multi-times a day...  experience.  And if the sharpener in your classroom wasn't in the best shape, it could be nearly impossible to get a proper, sharp point.And that was with the pretty-high-quality ones most schools bought at the time.  They had ""grinders"" which were, if properly aligned, pretty good at sharpening without consuming too much of the pencile.  Home sharpening was usually with a little plastic ""box"" with a razor blade inside at an angle, which you'd have to CAREFULLY twist the pencil inside of to shave it to a point... and it almost always broke, in my experience.Well, I still use pencils at times.  But the only at-home sharpening capability I had, prior to buying this, was either with one of those delicate little ""razor in a box"" sharpeners, or with a pocketknife.So, after the last time I struggled, I decided to see what was available.  And I found this unit.I love it.  It's never, yet, broken a tip, it shaves off just enough to give me the point without consuming too much of the pencil (wasting it), and it can be operated with just one hand...  a huge benefit.  This is a drastic improvement on even the best-quality ""in classroom"" sharpener of my past experience, and renders my little ""razor in a box"" sharpener totally pointless.The only drawback is that it takes up a bit of countertop or desktop space.  You can't just stick it into the drawer, as I have always done with my ""razor in a box"" sharpener.  It needs to be plugged in, as well... to me, that's what I wanted, but that means you have to mount it near an available power outlet or power strip.  There are battery-operated ones which, depending on how you want to use it, may be better suited for you.But the fact that this sharpens with almost no effort, and gives me the most consistent, and almost delicately sharp points I've ever personally seen, makes this a full five-star rating from me!",5
B086PMM18D,"First impressions are excellent. Noise is minimal, sharpens the pencils quickly, and the power cord is quite long so could see that being useful for different applications. It does slide when pushing the pencil in, but holding it in place lightly solves that problem. Overall very happy with this purchase - will update if necessary.",5
B086PMM18D,A great product for a great pr ice!,5
B086PMM18D,Quality of the product is great. It sharpens really good.  I would recommend it.,5
B086PMM18D,"Sharpens pencils good. Round or square. Have found it is picky, just barley put in the pencil I found works best. It stops if you put the pencil in to far.",4
B086PMM18D,"Great sharpener! Does what is needed.  However it is so light that I need to use two hands to use it, as it scoots around.",4
B086PMM18D,This is good. But did not realize it only works for regular pencil size. Sharpens very well. Easy to use.,4
B086PMM18D,So far so good,5
B086PMM18D,Needed for work nice and small works well,5
B086PMM18D,I love a good sharp pencil and this X-ACTO delivers. I now have two of them.,5
B086PMM18D,Excellent,5
B086PMM18D,I swear by this brand for all my schooling needs. Works very well. Highly recommend.,5
B086PMM18D,"Good sharpener but auto shut off pencil saver feature does not work, it will sharpen 1 pencil from new to nothing in one shot.",4
B086PMM18D,This product from X-Acto is long lasting. The last one I bought lasted me 15-20 years.,5
B086PMM18D,For about $15 this electric pencil sharpener is 'good enough' for an occasional pencil sharpening. Not sure how it would handle large volumes of pencils at a time. Collection bowl needs to be emptied often. Machine also needs to be held down because it's very lightweight (plastic). My old sharpener didn't need to be held.,4
B086PMM18D,Works well,5
B086PMM18D,what i like about this product is the different sizes of holes around it for all sorts of pencil sizes.easy to empty,5
B086PMM18D,"My pencil point got stuck inside the sharpener and affected the proper sharpening of my pencils. I contacted customer service, provided proper information via email and they sent me a new sharpener, quickly. You can trust this product & company. A rare combination of excellence existing in the world, today.",5
B086PMM18D,Works great,4
B086PMM18D,Awesome pencil sharpener,5
B086PMM18D,"I really wanted one that didn't take up much space and would make less of a mess than hand held. It's supposed to stop when it's sharp, but it doesn't so my kids will go through the whole pencil just for funsies",4
B086PMM18D,"It seems to work well, but one bur/blade must be a little off. I have to rotate the pencil to get an even cut.",4
B086PMM18D,"I have been pining for a proper pencil sharpener since my homeschool days. During my youth (I can't believe I'm old enough now to be able to say ""my youth"" and it's actually in the distant past) we had a wall-mounted pencil sharpener and we had to turn a handle to get the job done. It was a ton of fun and I enjoyed the smell of pencil shavings. I have moved so many times, we never did find that pencil sharpener. A travesty, truly.I have spent the past decade using one of those little square jobs where you have to crank the pencil clockwise and 90% of the time, the tip will break off and then you have to dig it out of the little plastic square to try again, only to realize the pencil core is broken and this will be a continual occurence everytime you want a sharp pencil. A nightmare.This little electric pencil sharpener is the answer to my woes. It big enough to remind me of the one I grew up with, but honestly, it's for lazy people like me. No hand cranking. No lever turning. Just stick the pencil in, and hold on. Pull out after a few seconds to see if it's the desired sharpness (or to prevent a broken tip, because if you've sued those little plastic squares for as long as I have you WILL become paranoid with every pencil sharpening attempt from here on out).The pencil shavings collect in the front, so you can see how full it is. I have yet to try emptying mine because I have not sharpened enough pencils yet. For the record, I have sharpened 40 Crayola colored pencils to pristine tips and I haven't even filled this sucker to 25% capacity yet. You can sharpen a lot of pencils with this baby. Just plug it into a wall socket or power strip and you are officially in business. I love it. And you probably will too.",5
B086PMM18D,First one worked for two years.,5
B086PMM18D,good quality. ... from now on i only trust Xacto product for sharpener!,4
B086PMM18D,"Product was an expected speed, function, ease to use no directions required. Very self explanatory did not take long to get it assembled. It is everything I thought it would be and more.",5
B086PMM18D,It's small but mighty. Works well not too loud. I love the size it fits in a cubby hole in my desk.,5
B086PMM18D,"I do a lot of ""arting"" and I use Prismacolor pencils which do not appreciate hand held sharpeners at all. I purchased this X-Acto sharpener primarily for them. New out of the box, I tested this sharpener on a standard #2 pencil. The sharpener seemed to struggle greatly to work. I'm keeping it because I need a sharpener now, but I won't buy this again.",3
B086PMM18D,I love it is small but it sharpens my pencil great!,5
B086PMM18D,Does the job well without having to empty often.,5
B086PMM18D,"Picked up my package, opened it, plugged it in and promptly sharpened my pencils. Worked like a charm! Just needed a replacement for my last sharpener that quit working. Will be used on an infrequent basis in our home but nice to have one that sharpens quickly and accurately.",5
B086PMM18D,"I had an X-acto sharpener for years and years, and I loved it. That particular model wasn't available, so there was only a choice of a teacher model (HUGE, so not helpful) and this one. This barely works.One concern is that it doesn't stay still on my table, so I need two hands to sharpen a pencil (one to hold the sharpener, and one for the pencil. The sharpener grabs at the pencil and sharpens it so fast and fiercely that most of my pencils are left with gouges or longer wood points that go past the sharpened lead. The pencils are left so pointy enough that the tips snap; they're not smooth and useful.I'll be replacing this with a different brand and model soon.",2
B086PMM18D,"Works well, but for an Art class to use (constantly sharpening pencils and colored pencils everyday), it doesn't last the whole 10-month school year before the blades dull down. But maybe an Art class is an out-of-the-ordinary situation for this product.",4
B086PMM18D,Do the job and faster,5
B086PMM18D,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Seems to work OK. We had a little cheap handheld sharpener that broke so we wanted something better. It's definitely better than the battery one we had as well. You DO NOT have to push it in hard or it will quit. It did catch and quit on me when sharpening some of our colored pencils for some reason but sharpened regular pencils without an issue which is why I gave it 4 stars. It works fine if you just gently put the pencil in.,4
B086PMM18D,"Finally, a really great electric pencil sharpener that actually works. Easy to use, doesn't take up much desk space and super easy to move from desk to craft table. Price wasn't sky high, either. Perfect home model. Homeschooling essential.",5
B086PMM18D,"My school provided me with the better version, but my students broke it. I bought this as a replacement. It works good, but it's very loud.",3
B086PMM18D,I've been using it for a few months now and it works great. Everything seems great except that the pencil shavings tray is small so I have to empty it often.,5
B086PMM18D,"This sharpener gives your pencil a good, strong point.",5
B086PMM18D,"Actually, I'm not sure how to rate this. I gave it 4 stars, but maybe it only deserves 3. I really thought X-acto, having the good reputation it does, would guarantee that this would be an outstanding purchase. It worked well at first - and that's important because I like to color and have many pencils to keep sharpened. However, after a very short time, the sharpener was just spinning without any affect. Fortunately, my husband did something to it. I don't know what and he said he didn't either, but now it is working. I have to wonder, though, for how long. I am discouraged because this should be something fairly simple to make, but even so, many of the different sharpeners have problems. I've had 3 in the last few months. I guess you'll have to decide if you want to take a chance on this product or not.",4
B086PMM18D,Gets my Prisma pencils razor sharp. Should have had this years ago. Pleased!,5
B086PMM18D,SHARP PENCILS!!!,5
B086PMM18D,Great pencil sharpener. Works quickly and sharpens well. No broken pencil tips using this!,5
B086PMM18D,Easy to use and empty shavings. Just plug it in when ready to use. Fast and efficient.,5
B086PMM18D,"I mean. It's awesome what can I say. I got so tired of using little hand sharpeners on my sketching pencils and the lead just crackling inside. And then sharpening again. Just to draw and have the lead plop out because it's cracked deeper in the wood from my hand pressure.No issues with this guy. Sharpens pencils to that fine-fine point.Like so fine. Mnn, darlin' fine.like 'how YOU doin' ;) fine.Good sharpener.",5
B086PMM18D,2.5 yo almost put a pencil in reverse today so review might change and -star because my kids were fighting over the pencil to erase writing on the table and noted it would probably stab through an eye ball so a bit too sharp.,4
B086PMM18D,Does what it's supposed to. Would buy again.,4
B086PMM18D,great products,5
B086PMM18D,Good pencil sharpener for the price but can be kind of loud. After quiet hours in my dorm I find I should use a manual sharpener because this thing is just soo loud and I am afraid of disturbing others. But it does sharpen really well and I prefer to use this during the day because it is more convenient.,4
B086PMM18D,I am upset that the sharpener stopped working shortly after buying it. It worked well for a few weeks with intermittent use. One day I plugged it in and it just stopped. I am contacting the company and will update if repaired.,2
B086PMM18D,"Bought this for a 7 yr old. He loves it. Told this grandma, It works better than those battery operated ones, it's  easy to get the shavings out.",4
B086PMM18D,Perfect for kids room,5
B086PMM18D,"So far this pencil sharpener has not let me down, sharpens pencils to pretty sharp point and is just the perfect amount",5
B086PMM18D,I have 2 little kids so this is really a life saver. Doesn't eat up too much pencils but keep them nice and sharp,5
B086PMM18D,"I teach.  My students always try to sharpen their colored pencils in my school-issued, cheap sharpener.  It just chews them up.  Got this to sit on my desk.  It sharpens the colored pencils with no issues.  It's a nice small size also so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  The cord also detaches from the back so you can just unplug it from the back to take it to the trash can to empty. IYKYK",5
B086PMM18D,"I use a lot of colored pencils and I needed a sharpeners that was more automated than my doing it by hand.  I kept breaking the pencils as I was getting more and more tired.  I finally found this pencil sharpeners that sounded perfect for my pencils.  The description was right  on the money and it didn't cost a fortune.  Including the two AA batteries you provide, you won't spend more than ten or fifteen dollars.  I rate this product as a ten.",5
B086PMM18D,Sharpens well and is easy to use.,5
B086PMM18D,Like small and compactDislike noise,4
B086PMM18D,"I read the reviews and was concerned about some things that proved to be valid. It is noisy and sounds like it is grinding the pencils. My concern was the opening where you push the pencil in, it was tight and I had to push the pencil to get past the opening to activate the actuator that starts the blade turning. The manual says not to push the pencil in, but it is the only way to get past the tight opening, Once the pencil was in, the pencil rotates and flops all over like it is not straight inside the unit. Overall, I got about 30 pencils (graphite & colored pencils) sharpened to a nice point. Mine did have a cord with it, since some reviews say they did not get a cord. I really wished that I had ordered a unit that would allow you to replace the internal blade/cutters once it gets dull, but alas you cannot do that with this unit.",4
B086PMM18D,Not as powerful as other electric pencil sharpeners and it keeps breaking or eating the pencil.,3
B086PMM18D,"Bogs down easily. Wont stop feeding after sharpening so it will eat an entire pencil. Not the best , get the Stapler brand with Ac cord. Avoid this one.",2
B086PMM18D,"I had this pencil sharpener's big brother for probably 20 years, and it finally gave out.  This one is smaller and I expect it to last a long time. Happy with purchase!",5
B086PMM18D,The media could not be loaded.,5
B086PMM18D,Ok,5
B086PMM18D,"Works like the one I replaced ..hopefully it will last longer than my previous oneWorks like the one I previously had..hopefully, it will last longer than the one replaced (same time exact sharpener)",5
B086PMM18D,"I thought the name Exacto would be more precise in the grinding of the point, but this version broke the leads and made asymmetrical shavings of the pencil wood many times before I could get a decent point.",3
B086PMM18D,"Don't use it alot, but does a great job. Long, pinpoint lead everytime.",5
B086PMM18D,"Fine item! Sharpens pencils rapidly and leaves a great, sharp tip!",5
B086PMM18D,What a record! This pencil sharpener has made it the whole school year and is still working as well as it did on the first day.,5
B086PMM18D,Me gusta mucho es lo mismo de la foto,5
B086PMM18D,This is very powerful and works great.,4
B086PMM18D,"Just buy it, it's great. We especially love how easy it is to unplug the DC connector from the back to take the whole unit to the trash when emptying the tray.",5
B086PMM18D,"It was bought because other product ""Prismacolor Premier Pencil Sharpener"" that I bought days before this Sharpener worked so bad that only breaks pencils. This X-ACTO product did the job effortless. Prices of both ones are comparable. There is no comparison. I can only wish to buy it first.",5
B086PMM18D,Exactly as described. I am satisfied!,5
B086PMM18D,"We bought this two months ago, and you really have to jam the pencils in it to sharpen. After two months it broke. Just stopped working.",3
B0868QQ1X6,"These brushes are pretty good for the price. I bought them to practice oil painting, and while I'm not too good at it, that's not by fault of the brushes! They're smooth and easy to use. I did notice a couple brush hairs fell out when I first got them, but I think some minor shedding is to be expected, and there's been no other issues since then. I'm not sure how long these brushes last, but I would definitely buy from this seller again!",5
B0868QQ1X6,"Very nice brushes and a caring company.  I bought these for when I travel and they are great for that. I like a paint in watercolor when I travel and prefer to have everything accessible.  A nice compact package, with a nice selection and quality at an affordable price. Thank you.",5
B0868QQ1X6,"When I got the package, the first thing I noticed was that none of the bristles were out of place or distorted. As I do with any new brushes, I take them out one at a time and check the ferrule for any play. Several were ever-so-slightly loose, (many brushes are subject to this, even ""top of the line"" brands) which is easily solved by using a small brass furniture nail (1/2"" long) and small mallet; grip the nail in a pliers and give it one gentle tap at the bottom of the ferrule without driving it in. Just enough to dimple the ferrule; the nail shouldn't need to be pulled out) I then wet the brushes and use a brush cleaner/conditioner, shape the bristles accordingly, and cut a cover for the bristles. (Straws and heat shrink tubing works great for this) The brushes hold a fair amount of paint, and apply the paint smoothly and they clean up very easily. I would recommend them without hesitation for the hobbyist or beginner. While not a true ""high end"" brush, with a little tweaking and proper care they perform like much more expensive brushes. A great variety for starting out or for replacing cheaper ""included in kit"" brushes that you've outgrown and want to upgrade affordably.",4
B0868QQ1X6,A nice set of brushes for different paint mediums. Good quality and value.,5
B0868QQ1X6,I personally like these brushes a lot because they are soft and smooth to paint with. They also come with a variety of brushes with different sizes shape. They are very good quality. I absolutely love them.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Good brushes for my acrylic painting...,5
B0868QQ1X6,I like the size of them and the bristles are really nice,3
B0868QQ1X6,"These are nice but after one use, one of the ferrules came loose.  Could be a fluke and haven't used too many of them yet so just took one star off for now.  We'll see how they hold up.",4
B0868QQ1X6,I like these brushes and there is a nice variety. It's a good value for the money. Very soft bristles.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Easy to use for starting painting again, the strokes of the brushes are lovely and well defined yet easy to manipulate.",5
B0868QQ1X6,They arrived well packaged and they are pretty. Perfect for the project I needed. Plus the thank you note was an extra touch.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Very good brushes !!! Super soft and are a good size,5
B0868QQ1X6,Exactly what I wanted in the line of watercolor brushes. Price was right.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Love these brushes. Excellent quality at a great price.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Love the quality of these brushes. For a beginner artist, I especially appreciate that the brushes are numbered so I can refer back to instructions for different watercolor projects. I support family-owned businesses whenever possible.",5
B0868QQ1X6,Love them.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Great brushes,5
B0868QQ1X6,Great quality brushes!,5
B0868QQ1X6,I am a professional illustrator/artist. These are very good brushes for the price. They retain their shape well after use and hold paint well. My expenses sable artist brushes are in storage after a move so I purchased these to complete book illustrations. I was pleasantly pleased.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Good for the price! Probably not as nice as you could get but for a starting artist they work great,5
B0868QQ1X6,I'm a watercolor beginner and I am loving these brushes.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Good quality brushes. very pleased.,5
B0868QQ1X6,These brushes were great for a variety of uses like painting a dollhouse that I was building and I also used them for applying glue,5
B0868QQ1X6,These brushes are perfect! Love them!,5
B0868QQ1X6,I am very happy with these brushes. They are good sizes for fine painting,5
B0868QQ1X6,This is the perfect set I was looking for.  Great quality and came earlier than expected.  Also a wonderful/beautiful thank you card was sent along with the shipment.  I highly recommend!,5
B0868QQ1X6,"I use these a lot for touching up paint or stain.  I also use them to spread glue.  The bristles stay intact, easy to hold and use.  Great size, nice, thick handles",5
B0868QQ1X6,"I bought these for a child in need who requested art supplies, so I ended up buying this along with lots of other items, and it looks great! Unfortunately, I can't use the brushes so I don't know how they work, but seem like great quality to me!",5
B0868QQ1X6,"I recently purchased the painting brush, and it has quickly become an essential tool in my art kit. The quality of the brush is outstanding, with soft yet resilient bristles that maintain their shape even after multiple uses and washes. It glides smoothly across the canvas, allowing for precise control whether you're working on fine details or broader strokes.",5
B0868QQ1X6,Received the brushes promptly. The order included a variety of sizes and recommended for different types of paint. I would recommend these brushes.,5
B0868QQ1X6,I order these brushes to use with my water colors. I also used to paint with oils but switched over because of the mess oils make. I haven't painted in years so I didn't want to invest a fortune and got these brushes. They are well made and did an excellent job. I am going to purchase more for  a friend who does acrylics. I would buy these again in a minute.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Good brushes for watercolor. Have not used all of them of course but am happy with the various sizes and softness of the bristles.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Very nice, affordable brushes. My daughter loves them.",5
B0868QQ1X6,Im on a journey of learning to paint and im happy with this brushes thank you,5
B0868QQ1X6,I used these brushes on fabric.  They worked great.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Just getting into watercolor, & this set has ALL the brushes I need!",5
B0868QQ1X6,I'm a beginner at watercolor and have found these to be a good quality for the price.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Very nice brushes, bought them for my great granddaughter and she loves them",4
B0868QQ1X6,great gift!,5
B0868QQ1X6,These brushes are good quality and a lot of variety of sizes to choose from.,5
B0868QQ1X6,A brush for any stoke,4
B0868QQ1X6,Fast delivery. Great quality,5
B0868QQ1X6,"These brushes are perfect for the cat makeup I did for halloween. They arrived quickly, sealed and with a cute little thank you note. I love supporting small businesses and Benicci will get my business again. Thank you Brad and Jane!",5
B0868QQ1X6,Quality brushes for a low price. Soft bristles that retain shape and don't shed. Highly recommend this product!,5
B0868QQ1X6,They work fine,4
B0868QQ1X6,"I love them!I am a beginner painter, having been an amateur artist for a while, but just starting to try painting, and I am very happy with these! What a great choice!They keep their hairs very well, and they keep their shape VERY well. I'm surprised, honestly!These are specially heat treated, I think, that makes them spring back into shape.Also, from this inexpensive set, I noticed the brushes that I really liked. For me, they are the big Square one (Flat Tip), and the Curve-tip Brush (Filbert Tip). The big one is easy to use and I guess does what I expect a paint brush to do.And the Filbert Brush is great for making lines without putting paint where you don't want it, which could be hard, but is easier with that brush.As I become more experienced, I think I will come to like the other ones more (I'm still using them often, maybe 5 at a time), but those 2 are my current favorites.I hope the review was helpful. I'm writing this months after purchase, and I remember spending a long time researching paint brushes, and these seemed like very good brushes. I'm personally satisfied with them. I would like more brushes, still, though. I feel like I don't have brushes that are good for details, but I still haven't learned many techniques, yet.One thing someone said to me I remembered was (paraphrased from memory) ""Whatever you buy for brushes, buy something cheap so that you can be creative with it and treat it exploratively.""So, maybe it would be good for you to destroy your brushes making art that's worth $10 Thousand Dollars! I'm not sure, but I think you should be creative with your brush, and maybe buy an extra set so you can do what you really want to with the first set.Cheers!",5
B0868QQ1X6,"These brushes are excellent. They feel high quality in now they handle paint, their weight in my hand, the variety of sizes and shapes and ease of use. They also maintain their shape well after use. Definitely planning on buying from this company again!",5
B0868QQ1X6,I was looking for some brushes to get into watercolor and these were perfect. They are cheap and look pretty. They hold water well and the bristles are nice :D,5
B0868QQ1X6,Nice Brush Selection,5
B0868QQ1X6,Inexpensive but highly useful.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Im disabled and the brushes are easy to use,5
B0868QQ1X6,This is my second time purchasing this set. They hold up to my abuse and never ever shed.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"After using these brushes several weeks, I am very pleased with the quality!  Not a bristle lost after using, and they clean up easily and keep their shapes.  Very reasonably priced.  Packing of this product is also worth mentioning as it makes a lovely gift, with thank you card attached from this small family owned company!",5
B0868QQ1X6,Would buy again,5
B0868QQ1X6,These are really nice.Well made solid little set of paintbrushes,5
B0868QQ1X6,"These are a great quality for the price. The soft bristles make them perfect for watercolor painting. The variety of sizes, especially the flat ones, are exactly what I was looking for!",5
B0868QQ1X6,"One of the local students asked for this. He was grateful and reported back every brush he needed was there, and well valued for the quality. that's all I know about them, but if he gives it 5 STARS, who am I to complain?",5
B0868QQ1X6,I got these brushes in today and the quality is so so nice! The price point is insanely good for the quality of these brushes. I will definitely be purchasing brushes from this brand from now on. The bristles are very soft and nicely set. The handle is very sturdy and comfortable in the hands. I highly recommend!!!,5
B0868QQ1X6,Bought these for my daughter. She likes to do acrylic painting on canvas. They work good so far.,4
B0868QQ1X6,Great deal for a variety of paint brush sizes.  Holds up well with use and washing. Brushes have stayed intact.,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Brush with smooth strokes and for all media except Oil. Good hold for all media color, water, Acrylic, Tampra, Poster and Silk. Soft bristles.",5
B0868QQ1X6,"I was drawn to these because of the look they have. I think they are cute! The bristles length are good, has good water and shape retention!",5
B0868QQ1X6,These brushes are nice they paint very well with no brush lines and the hold together good. For the price i will be ordering more,5
B0868QQ1X6,"The brushes were exactly as the picture and the description. Work great for a beginner, like me. The price point was great for someone new to using watercolors.",5
B0868QQ1X6,There are no disappointments in this package.,5
B0868QQ1X6,Excelente,5
B0868QQ1X6,"I will always support a small business, this are very nice and quality pencils I bought for my little 3.5 y old. I love the little thank you card with a fam pic. So darling. God Bless you all!",5
B0868QQ1X6,Nice selection of quality brushes,5
B0868QQ1X6,"Great bursh variety for all ages. I love how they are simple but have the best details for a beginner. I'm trying to paint a book cover and after so many youtube videos, I learned that I needed specific brushes. I was happy to turn the package around and find the names of each brush. Makes it easy when the brushes have numbers. I've just started using them and they are holding their shape very well. The bristles are not falling off as I paint or after I clean them with water. Definitely way better than my dollar tree brushes. Lol Lastly, their little Thank You note was adorable. Little details that count!",5
B0868QQ1X6,Great set of brushes.. currently using watercolor and gouache mediums for my works. Thank you!,5
B0868QQ1X6,I'm an artist and these work gtreat,5
B0868QQ1X6,They are perfect for what I wanted they are definitely in my top three sets. Thank you for making such great quality brushes for a great price!!!!! The stiffness of the brushes is just right!!,5
B0868QQ1X6,The brushes came quickly.  They are nice brushes for a great price,5
B0868QQ1X6,I really enjoy these brushes! I use them to apply glaze to my ceramics and they are well made with a variety of sizes that help me to personalize and perfect my work!,5
B0868QQ1X6,"These brushes are great! I am always tinkering around the house and yard doing some kind of project! I have used these for so many projects, but mostly pottery repair/painting. I thought brushes this nice would be more expensive. Nice assortment to choose from. High quality. Would recommend!",5
B0868QQ1X6,Good but don't the best. Good for kids,4
B0868QQ1X6,"These affordable paint brushes exceeded my expectations! The quality for the price is exceptional. The bristles are sturdy yet flexible, allowing for precise strokes and smooth application. I was pleasantly surprised by their durability; they held up well even after multiple uses and cleanings. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned artist on a budget, these brushes are a fantastic investment. They provide excellent value without compromising on performance. I've used them for various projects, and they consistently deliver reliable results. If you're looking for reliable, budget-friendly paint brushes, these are a fantastic choice.",4
B0868QQ1X6,"The brushes were just what I was looking for, since I wanted to play around with watercolor. They are a great value, with lots of different shapes and sizes.",4
B0868QQ1X6,these seem to be a pleasant experience. I didn't realize how old my brushes were.They make the paint flow well and I like the firmness. I hope they hold up well.,5
B098NMLWR2,"Love these cool pencils. They are thick and sharpen well. A perfect gift for someone who enjoys coloring books. It is fun to see the finished project, because depending on how you hold then pencil, you get a different outcome.",5
B098NMLWR2,"My 7year old granddaughter was delighted with these pencils! When coloring, each pencil produces a variety of colors and a surprise outcome each time.  Primarily pastels, but fascinating to see the outcomes each time.  I love the creativity it sparks.",5
B098NMLWR2,"These were fantastic, but a couple of the color combinations tend to not blend very well and they just look like a solid color but the ones that have differentiating colors really do pop!",5
B098NMLWR2,"Like the quality of pencil itself.  It feels good,  it's large,  still last a while! I was just disappointed with the variety of colour it produced.  It is good for backgrounds.  Instead of blending colors,  this is preblended for you.",4
B098NMLWR2,Very fun and cool coloring pencils! Sturdy and durable.,5
B098NMLWR2,"These are vibrant and beautiful pencils. They are thick and sturdy and do not break easily. All 3 of my children, ages 4-9, have been enjoying them!",5
B098NMLWR2,"I have other multi colored pencils and like the color choices and quality of these .  They are soft and blend well.  The only issue I had is that they are very fat, so if you are trying to do fine lines or small spaces, they can be tough to use.",3
B098NMLWR2,"These pencils are great. They color almost like a crayon, but better. They are thicker than most pencils but they fit in a regular sharpener and it only takes 2 turns to get a point on it. I see these pencils lasting a long time.",4
B098NMLWR2,Love them,5
B098NMLWR2,Love it,5
B098NMLWR2,I bought this group of rainbow marking pencils for my 10 yr old granddaughter! They look awesome and she will enjoy coloring with them!,5
B098NMLWR2,"Super colorful, good quality",5
B098NMLWR2,Color nicely they are just chunky coloring pencils,5
B098NMLWR2,They were part of a gift for my grandsons and they seemed to love using them.,5
B098NMLWR2,They were a stocking stuffer for my granddaughter and she loves them!,5
B098NMLWR2,Our grandchildren loved the multicolored pencils.,5
B098NMLWR2,Will be fun to use.,5
B098NMLWR2,Kids loved them.,5
B098NMLWR2,You can become very creative with these pencils vibrant florescent colors,5
B098NMLWR2,Nice,5
B098NMLWR2,I purchased these for my preschool kiddos. We are working on a coral reef. My kiddos loved the colors when working on their coral life. They cracked me up telling me how cool the colors were. So yes I would recommend highly .Thank youMs. Becky,5
B098NMLWR2,Love the colors! Great gifts!,5
B098NMLWR2,My elementary school students absolutely love these pencils that I give as a reward in therapy.,5
B098NMLWR2,"Perfect for my grandchildren, they will love them",5
B098NMLWR2,"I used these to color drawings of fish, oil slicks, water, flowers and birds",5
B098NMLWR2,These were totally cool to the kids.  Good quality.  Would buy again.,5
B098NMLWR2,Came in fast and was exactly what I was expecting.,5
B098NMLWR2,My granddaughter loves these.,5
B098NMLWR2,"Love these, fun to play with.",5
B098NMLWR2,Smooth drawing. Beautiful colors and the blending shift from one into another is perfect! They sharpen well (manual hand held sharpener) and the points hold. Good for adults and kids alike. Or for the kid who lives in all of us adults! Have been playing with drawing colorful Octopi lately. These pencils are perfect!!  Highly recommend. Planning to buy more as gifts!,5
B098NMLWR2,This product is for a Xmas present so I think it will be great but I don't have any other comment on this product,5
B098NMLWR2,"If you have excellent drawing talent, are a sketch artist, or are an expert colorist - these are for you.  If you're just average & wanted to have some fun with these, these may still be for you.  If not, your mileage you get out of using these will vary.  I am none of these things, so mine will probably sit in a drawer.Also, my pencils arrived hard as rocks.  All of this ""they're buttery, creamy, they're like Prismacolor!!!"" hype in other reviews does not apply to the set I received.  They don't blend or layer great.  So again, your experience may vary greatly.If you just want to experiment & have fun, go for it, but I would not invest in these heavily unless you've already got some innate talent at your disposal.",3
B098NMLWR2,Very poor quality pencils. Immediately broke while using,3
B098NMLWR2,"Writing letters and sketching they are good.If you intend to color with these a colorless blending pencil is pretty much required. Don't press hard either because sometimes it will go from one color to another in the blink of an eye and go away just as quickly. No blending pencil can save you from that and it looks like a random purple patch in a space with blue. If I had a gentler and slower hand I could have salvaged that. Also, if you are coloring with these, you need to color with the shape. I colored a flower and just colored up and down to fill it in quickly. It doesnt look very good. But if I colored each individual petal it looked good.  They work best on quality paper for coloring. On cheap paper, for coloring, not good. Writing on cheap paper is fine.The koh i noors are better by far and respond to blending pencils better but these work well too once you figure out how they work. The magic fx koh i noors don't come anywhere close to this color variety though.EDIT: I used gamsol with these and they really came alive!!!!",5
B098NMLWR2,"In my old age I have taken up a hobby of coloring, I have two sets of glitter pens, one set of metallic pens, some art permanent markers and other art pens. When I saw these NSXSU Multicolored Pencils, I had to have them. I searched the internet to find a teaching video of how to use these pencils, I eventually did find what I was looking for, these pencils will do ocean colors and or ski colors, or even fall foliage with just one pencil. If you are interested in these pencils, find a video that will teach BEGINNERS most other videos will be accomplished artist that mostly talk about themselves and their work, the beginner video was great and I have started my lessons so I will be able to use these pencils appropriately to get the best results.",5
B098NMLWR2,I like the way they color. Easy to use .,4
B098NMLWR2,"These rainbow colored pencils are a delight and I keep learning new ways to use them. Replaced my myriad of pens, colored pencils Xs100.  I'm anxiously awaiting more colors released!!!!!",5
B098NMLWR2,Kids loved it,5
B098NMLWR2,"Great colors, easy to use, and handle.",5
B098NMLWR2,Pencils were exactly as described.  Expect to make some fun pictures.,5
B098NMLWR2,"Very fun pencils.  I like the various color combinations---about half of them are similar to color combinations found in Koh-I-Noor Tritones or Magic Pencils, and the other half of the pencils have unique color combinations different from those found in the Koh-I-Noor products.  Just wish each pencil was assigned a name or number and had it printed on the pencil, so that one could reference that to quickly know which pencil one was picking up to use.  There's a couple of cases where it's very hard to tell the pencils apart by just looking at the lead colors.  For instance, there's one pencil that is a blue and purple combo, and another that appears very similar when you just look at the lead, but in reality, that other pencil also contains green.  And there's another pair involving fuchsias which look similar in the lead, but actually have differences when used.  I made myself a little swatch sheet, and then I wrote numbers on my pencils near the back end of them with a white acrylic marker, so I can easily identify which is which.",5
B098NMLWR2,Kids live them,5
B098NMLWR2,Gift for Grandaughter w sketch pad and how to draw book. She LOVED these pencils! Bought a set for myself!!!,5
B098NMLWR2,Bought these for my daughters friends birthday. They were so cool I had to by my own child a pack!,5
B098NMLWR2,These pencils have nice bright colors.,5
B098NMLWR2,"These Rainbow Pencils are a solid choice for young children. The size makes them easier for little hands to hold and grip. The pencils seem durable, with thicker cores that are less likely to break compared to standard colored pencils.  Overall, these pencils are a good option for introducing young children to colored pencils.  They're easy to hold and seem built to last.",5
B098NMLWR2,"Finally used them tonight . They do not give you swirly different colors as an affect .  They are not very dark .  My almost 4 year old grandson could not push hard enough on paper for you to see his writing /coloring .  Dollar store pencils do the same and much cheaper . Hard pass .  The presentation of the oruducf was good though , solid product and arrived whole and intact",2
B098NMLWR2,"Although this is stated clearly in the product description, I just wanted to reiterate that the 24 pack comes with 2 of each of 12 ""colors"".",3
B098NMLWR2,Really love the colors in these pencils they're awesome.,5
B098NMLWR2,These are nice pencils. The reason I give only 4 stars is because they are big pencils that need a special sharpener not the regular size you see everywhere.,4
B098NMLWR2,"My kids (7 and 10) love these, they love taking them to school abd sharing them with their classmates, they all want to play with them! They are really thick and color full, and look very sturdy.",5
B098NMLWR2,These pencils seem to be of good quality & feel good in your hand.,5
B098NMLWR2,"These are neat:) love how the colors blend blend:) bought 2, 1 for me and 1 for work:)will be buying again",5
B098NMLWR2,Super bellos,5
B098NMLWR2,Pretty cool for something different to work with.,5
B098NMLWR2,"my daughters love these! they're easy to sharpen, add so much fun and creativity to your coloring. can't complain about the price either.",5
B098NMLWR2,It looks pretty cool but you have to be coloring in a design to really see the effects..,4
B098NMLWR2,Not what I thought they'd be. If you don't color with them just right they only have 1 color that transfers. I don't recommend waisting money on these.,2
B098NMLWR2,"I bought these for my grandkids to use , who are age 5 and seven. They are good quality and my grandkids love to draw with them. Buy them!",5
B098NMLWR2,"I like the ease of just filling in empty coloring space to get new and interesting effects depending on the pencil used, pressure, if I rotate the lead while coloring and so on. These were a little on the pricey side, in my opinion, but they are large, full size pencils, there are 8 of them and I still have not had to sharpen any of them after coloring 2 pages. That is unheard of for me. So they will likely pay for themselves quickly by not being sharpened to death. Speaking of sharpening, I just checked and they fit it all the sharpeners I use. Whew.The photos show four sample lines of each pencil. The pencil used to create those lines is pictured with the lead pointing into the group of four. I hope this helps as I noticed it may be hard to tell where one ends in the photo.5 stars.",5
B098NMLWR2,"This was a gift, and the recipient was thrilled with them.",5
B098NMLWR2,I have used rainbow pencils before and these are my new favorite! They are bigger than regular colored pencils but not quite as big as children's pencils/crayons. I also like the black on the outside. The only way these could be better is if the colors were labeled or numbered so you could make a grid. Still giving a 5 star rating!,5
B098NMLWR2,The pencils were out of their box and all over the bigger box. They were a gift to my daughter who is an art student in college.  I can't send her pencils she'll be using in school unsure if the leds are all broke or not. I have 2 packs of these myself and LOVE them. I Lucky For My Daughter And I I had An Unused Pack.,3
B098NMLWR2,Colors are great. Write well.,4
B098NMLWR2,Beautiful color contrasting,4
B098NMLWR2,Love the colors!,5
B098NMLWR2,"I love the pencils. They work very well and sharpen well, too. So colorful and enjoyable to use.",5
B098NMLWR2,Purchased for a stocking stuffer.  Pencils were a disappointment---didn't show multiple colors---just blended together.,2
B098NMLWR2,Kiddo enjoyed very much,4
B098NMLWR2,This was a gift for my daughter who loves to draw. I don't think she has used them yet . But she did love them when she opened them,4
B098NMLWR2,I love how bright these are.  Perfect for my daughter's Easter basket.,4
B098NMLWR2,Bought this product for my Granddaughter who loves to draw. She thought they were great.,5
B098NMLWR2,Purchase them if you can,5
B098NMLWR2,These pencils are FUN to use for sketching! Colors are bright each pencil has a different color combination.  Just so fun!,5
B098NMLWR2,"love these colored pencils, they are fun to use and work well",5
B098NMLWR2,Nice size for all ages.,5
B098NMLWR2,I loved the box they came in. But I wish there were more multi colored pencils instead of two of the same. But they are great. My 16 year old loves them..great quality also..,4
B098NMLWR2,"Nice color pencils, good color combinations.",5
B098NMLWR2,"Surprised by good quality. Definitely nontoxic... I am allergic to everything and these did not cause a wheeze,  sneeze, sniffle, or itch.  Strong lovely colors come out in alternating fun swirls.  The bottom of wide barrel pencil is marked with the dominant colors in each pencil, so you know what colors to expect.  Definitely recomend.",4
B098NMLWR2,"Great pencils. However they do not fit in a pencil sharpener, I'm not sure how I'm going to sharpeners them",4
B098NMLWR2,"These pencils are fun! fairly soft, with a smooth,  beautiful application. Layering is very pretty and easy to deepen to make more solid coloration.",5
B098NMLWR2,"These pencils are magical with one stroke the color changes by itself! I started off with orange then it changed to yellow and changed without having to angle the pencil or change your grip. These are easily blend able and last a long time. I like that you get two sets to make them a fun gift. They are great for all ages, don't believe the reviews that are negative. They will work for even little hands because they are easy to hold. Bought them for Easter baskets, may order again for Birthdays and other holidays they inspire creativity, and who doesn't love that!",5
B098NMLWR2,"Bought 2 sets of these pencils for my grandchildren and they were a big hit! The size is perfect but more importantly, the colors are vibrant and fun to use.",5
B098NMLWR2,"I thought drawing with these would resemble the old school multi crayon. Nope. Although buying the bigger pack doesn't get you more colors, the pencils are well made and the way they draw is indescribable, but in a good way.  My daughter has been using them non stop for a month and they are holding up great.",5
B098NMLWR2,"I was expecting something similar to a crayola colored pencil.  NOT AT ALl!  High quality.  Very thick.  Allows the colors to blend better.  I like you can look at the top of the pencil to see the colors as opposed to having to check the tip each time.  I like to use blended colors for shading and coloring of back rounds of pictures.  I was using the gel pens but figured I'd try pencils.  Can control boldness and would last longer.  I noticed other then these ones, other brands the sets of colors were in the same pattern which would cause the same effect for each pencil.  I wasn't looking for 8 of the same exact pencils.  Will buy again.",5
B001I912SQ,"The SKLZ Pro Mini Indoor Basketball Hoop is highly rated for its durability, realistic feel, and ease of use. While it can be a bit noisy and requires proper door dimensions, these are minor drawbacks compared to the hours of entertainment it provides. If you're looking for an affordable indoor basketball hoop, this is a solid choice!",4
B001I912SQ,"The product is awesome. Perfect size, great look, amazing quality. Is what you expect or more, and you can have endless hours of fun with it. playing at your office or at home. First thing you will need is to get a new ball, because the one that comes with the hoop will destroy everything around you, and it is so noisy and heavy that gets very uncomfortable to use. I ordered the ""POOF-Slinky 875 POOF 4-Inch Pro Mini Foam Basketball"" (very popular among the users of this hoop), but I strongly recommend to get the ""little tikes"" foam basketball (in Amazon it comes in a pack of 3, but I got it for $5 at Target, and it is only 1/2"" smaller than the one that comes with the hoop but in foam, perfect).Now, depending on how you install this hoop, you can have a terrible-all-the-time-moving and vibrating hoop, or a nice firm and realistic hoop. Since the product itself is high quality and the spring-action rim is a great feature, I was looking for the best way to mount it. Definitely, mounting it on the door was my last favorite option, not only because the distance between the ring and the ceiling was too short to enjoy shooting, but also because the vibration from the whole thing was ruining the experience, even with the foam ball. Then I decided to mount it on the wall. If you are considering that option, this is what I recommend for best results:What you need:- A phillips scredriver. Much better if you have an impact drill with the phillips head, so everything will be faster and easier.- 6 screws that are a good fit for the holes on the top (there are four holes, but you will end up putting 6 screws, since 2 will be for the bottom of the rim, where the ""orange"" square metal part is. I'll explain this later.- A level.How to mount it:1.- You need to remove the small structure (two pieces on the top) to mount the hoop on the door. It looks very easy, but the plastic screws that come already mounted are very cheap and they get ruined easily. Use the impact drill to unscrew and they will come just fine. If you do it with a screwdriver, be very careful or the head of the screw will get ruined with the minimun stress.2.- If you already built the rim, unscrew the 2 top screws of the 3 that are located at the bottom of the rim. When you do this, the rim will be attached to the backboard only by the bottom screw with its nut.3.- Chose the right place to install the hoop. Once you have it, take the level and putting it on the top of the backboard, screw the 4 top screws on their 4 holes to the wall.  Dont go crazy with the pressure, just do it firm to hold it strong to the wall, but without bending the backboard, try to keep it flat. The level should show that the backboard is totally straight (leveled).4.- Now, take the other 2 screws (same size than the 4 of the top), and through the 2 bottom holes right under the rim, screw them to the wall. Again, use the level to check that the rim is 100% straight too.Now you will see the backboard is stick to the wall, no sounds no vibrations. And the rim will go down with the spring, not bending the backboard. With this, you can enjoy the hoop being firm, and getting the best from the spring-action rim. Enjoy!",5
B001I912SQ,"Surprised to find that this $30 mini hoop ($38 with a replacement ball) is legitimately great. Remarkably sturdy and well-built. The hoop is solid metal, with a nice sturdy spring which in theory should permit nasty dunks. Clear plexi backboard, no problem there. Decent little nylon net. Basically easy to assemble, although the hex nuts are kind of finicky and hard to get on using the pointless little wrench they include. The included mini ball is actually great, it's got good, grippy texture and bounces reasonably well. My only complaint is that it's kind of, I don't know, ""harder"" material so the bounce is actually sort of loud. I would recommend getting a foam nerf-style ball if you live in an apartment or just don't want the extra noise. Same complaint for when you brick one; it clangs off the rim and backboard really really loudly.  The replacement ball seems to be made of a different, more rubbery material and doesn't really have the same realistic texture but bounces a little better and more quietly. Anyways, this is a really great hoop not just for the price but objectively. I'm having a ton of fun with it.",5
B001I912SQ,"We LOVED this thing! My son (who is constantly face first into his video games) couldn't get enough of this basketball hoop. He played on it for HOURS everyday. So much better than video games! However, it was short lived. A few months later he comes out crying because it has broken all the way across. He said, ""Mom, I didn't even dunk on it, i just went to tip it in but my hand ended up catching on the rim just on my fingertips. It broke clean across the plexi glass right where the metal bracket for the hoop is. I'm assuming the metal bracket created a weak point in the plexi every time he would dunk on it that eventually led to failure. But it was good while it lasted. Maybe they can find a way to reinforce or buffer the plexi at the hoop bracket.Pros: Gets the kids active, especially good for rainy days!  Helped him gain confidence and practice on his shooting (albeit with a mini ball)  TONS of fun for the kidsCons: It is VERY loud and obnoxious sounding the entire time they play on as it hits against the door constantly. (we buffered this by placing a folded towel behind it)  Does seem to have a design flaw as the metal bracket from the hoop causes the plexi to break clean across it.  My kids devastated for at least a couple days now until I order him a new one. :/",3
B001I912SQ,"We ordered the standard for one kid and the flip rim for the other, and unfortunately the standard really damaged our door (based on all the dunks).  The flip rim has the benefit of having a little more give -- both upwards and downwards -- so it doesn't cause as much damage to the door underneath it.That said - the kids LOVE them.  5/5 happy.  Just get the slightly more expensive version.",5
B001I912SQ,"This is a good set, it's a replacement for one that lasted a long time and was a lot of fun - but the ball was not in the box.",4
B001I912SQ,This is perfect for over the door. It is made of high quality materials. The spring give the kids the added fun of dunking the ball. I did end up purchasing a different ball. The foam one it comes with does not bounce.,4
B001I912SQ,Love the size and love that it comes with the soft ball.  My kids play with all day!! I do wish the goal could fold up so I could open the door all the way open.  But it is easy to take on and off.  My 11yr and 8yr old put the goal together.,4
B001I912SQ,"Bought this for my young boys, and they loved it! Dunk contest all day!!",5
B001I912SQ,It is great! Except you have to build the hoop. It has pretty good durability too.,4
B001I912SQ,"thanks for this product my nephew love it, kisses",5
B001I912SQ,my kids 5-16 love this. They put in on the back of doors in different places in our house to play different games. Hours of fun! Got it for Christmas and it's still going tstorng after lots of rough play.,5
B001I912SQ,This is great ! Obviously the people who broke theirs were hanging in the rim like it says not to.,4
B001I912SQ,"Kid likes it. Took one star off because the ball is kinda chincy, and because the screws behind the backboard create a dimple in the door. Maybe some extra padding there could help.",4
B001I912SQ,I bought this for my 11 year old nephew who plays with it in his room every day. I also got it for 2 brothers who live next door and they love theirs too.,5
B001I912SQ,This is really built well. It even has cushions on the back of it so it doesn't move a bunch.My kids are pretty rough with it and it still works well.At also the basketball that came with it is pretty good too.,5
B001I912SQ,Choose the hoop that was slightly larger and kids love it.,5
B001I912SQ,Good quality and durable. Fun for all ages.,5
B001I912SQ,Got this for my nephew for Christmas. He has been using it evey day. I think I may need to get one for myself,5
B001I912SQ,"I've owned 4 basketball hoops now, and this is my first one that works. Basically every hoop you know of is just a piece of plastic that breaks the first time you dunk on it, and can barely even handle normal shots.  You spend all of your time looking for a legitimate basketball hoop that you can shoot, dunk on, and put a lot of abuse on over a long period of time. This is it. Congratulations SKLZ, the only company I have found to make a normal basketball hoop that 100% of people in the basketball hoop industry are looking for. I've had this hoop for a few weeks, and i constantly dunk on it and take super hard shots and it does not show any wear and tare. i never actually thought that in my lifetime I would live to see a mini basketball hoop that you can dunk on, but i have been proved wrong for the better. The fact that this thing is only $25 is also amazing. It's a hoop that seems to be made out of regulation material, which feels very nice, and the backboard, although bendy, seems to put up against a lot. it was easy enough to set up, as it came with the 3 nuts, the 3 screws, the padded rim plate, and the wrench to put it all in place. but don't worry, those nuts and screws are to connect the rim to the backboard, not to put it into the wall.  it comes without the rim on the backboard because the box would have to be like 3 times as thick for it to be already set up, and the process really only takes 5 minutes at most. the hoop goes very nicely over the door, and the hooks are padded, but my personal experience is that i can't close the door with it on. my friend who introduced me to it has more room between his door and doorframe, so he can close his door with this on, so some doors may work to always have this on, although some like mine cannot. also, i thought that it would put stress on my door when i dunk on it or even leave it there, but it really doesn't. my advice though, is don't hang on it. ik it may be obvious to most people, but this thing isn't made out of diamond. if you weight 150 pounds and try to hang on it, it probably will break the backboard or the door, and it will be your fault!  my only complaint would be the ball. it's not a big complaint, but the ball is pretty heavy. my friend who introduced me to this hoop told me that his neighbor under him complains about the ball hitting the ground, so when we play, we have to put a pillow under it to stop the ball from hitting the ground. my solution is really just ditch the ball. you can buy foam balls in 3 packs or something like that for $5 at your local dicks or modell's or sports authority or whatever your local sports store is. i understand that SKLZ is going for a regulation type ball, but i have a ball made out of the same material that's basically the same size but is probably half the weight. i stick with my two foam balls, and that same material half weight ball. a complaint that i saw from other customers was that the ball doesn't come inflated, but i know exactly why. once you inflate the ball, you'll notice it's 50% thicker than the box it came in, so that's why people. all in all, this is very worth it to buy, as for what it is, $25 is paying nothing for the experience. you can shoot and dunk and not really have to worry about a thing. when this thing breaks in like 10 years or whenever in the far future, i will definitely buy it again without even thinking twice about it.",5
B001I912SQ,"Our Son loved this as a child and played for it for years both inside and outside when he was older. It's even a blast to play with your child as well or even alone when you are bored counting how many baskets you can make. I rather have this then a good over the door set anyday as an adult which I have bought too! The cost would be about the same. Of course as soon we felt our Grandson was ready on his first Christmas we bought him one. Unfortunately he somehow by hisself was able to break off the height adjustment and it was never found. At least we assume that. It was most likly sweept away unnoticed or picked up and thrown out as trash. We have no idea when he did this, but as empty nesters there are no other children around to have broke it. The only dog we have is a 2 pound Yorkie, and she's NOT going to reach it even if her little teeth could do the damage. It has always been played with and sits in our Sons old room (guestroom now). I was shocked he was able to do this, but unnoticed by us since we didn't have a need to adjust the height. Maybe it was defected or broken off when it was shipped to us as I can't see how he could of done this. Plus at his age he isnt left alone even in the room he plays in awake more then a minute or two at the most. By the time we noticed this it was way too late to complain about it, so I am redoing my review now. It's all I can do. This is the ONLY reason I am taking off a star. If anyone has an idea as how we can adjust the height now, I would sure appreciate your time and advice.I consider this a must have for a child. The set will last for years, and your Child/Grandchild will play with it for years as well. Our Son even played with it off and on as a teen with his friends once we moved it outside when thinking he was way too old to play with it anymore and he grew up to be 6'2. We finally gave it away to another child otherwise I bet it would still be playable if we had it. Absolutely a must buy! Maybe years ago the height adjustment was more durable, I don't know why ours broke so quickly. We never had this problem with the first one we bought. Once again, If anyone has an idea as how we can adjust the height now, I would sure appreciate your time and advice. I am a GREAT Barber, but my fix it skills aren't very good. :) I consider this a must have for a child. The set will last for years, and your child/Grandchild will play with it for years as well. Our Son even played with it off and on as a teen with his friends once we moved it outside when we thought he was way too old to use his with his friends and he grew up to be 6'2. Absolutely a must buy! Maybe years ago the adjustment was more durable, I don't know why ours broke so quickly. I really suspect it came that way to us. I did once buy a new case from Amazon once a long time ago, and it was shipped to me as used. Of course Amazon made it good. The customer service flat out can not be beat. At my age I will guarantee it.Although the ball it comes with is great, I would suggest a POOF-Slinky 875 POOF 4-Inch Pro Mini Foam Basketball as an added ball to go with the set. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002TMY1C/ref=ox_ya_os_product_refresh_T1 as a second ball. Believe me the ball will be misplaced off and on, so it's nice to have a 2nd ball, and this one is awesome.Thank you for reading my review, and if you do have advice for me, don't be shy. Definitely buy this!",4
B001I912SQ,As described. Well made,5
B001I912SQ,"It's small, yet the perfect size for indoor fun with the kids. My 6 year old is addicted to playing bball in the house now! Highly recommend this over the door hoop! Kids and myself having tons of fun.",5
B001I912SQ,Great Christmas gift for grandson.,5
B001I912SQ,Good hoop and all of that just package was kind of ripped up on one side and it was all taped up shut so im thinking the ball was taken out because it didnt come with a ball what so ever. but i have two smaller ones that i had from a previous hoop so i guess ill make it work,3
B001I912SQ,Left infront neighbor door other than than goal was good,4
B001I912SQ,Great little hoop but we needed to add some foam strips to the back because it was pretty loud,4
B001I912SQ,Great product my nephew loves it,5
B001I912SQ,5***** Thanks great seller arrive on time,5
B001I912SQ,"We have three boys, so we have had many mini hoops.  This one, by far, was the best we have had.  However, the net was a mess after one month.",3
B001I912SQ,My reason for 3 stars is because there was no inflator included,3
B001I912SQ,"Very sturdy, larger than most others I've seen. Springs on hoops are great for stability.",5
B001I912SQ,"This was a Christmas gift for my 7 year old.  He previously had a different brand that broke when he tried to dunks but it wasn't made for dunks!  I was excited for him to try this.Pros: - It is a nice size and was easy put together. - It has a good sized rim compared to some of the other over the door play sets. - It does come with some foam backing on it.Cons - The ball has to be inflated and I was afraid it wasn't going to hold air the way it was bent in the box  It has a few week spots on it. - The ball is heavier and harder than I expected it to be for an over the door set you would use inside.  We ended up buying a more lightweight ball to use.  I was afraid this ball would break something.  I feel like the ball it came with would be better suited or outdoor use. - It is NOISY.  Despite it being made to be a over the door set and despite it having foam around the back, it is loud.  We have standard indoor doors and it doesn't fit snug.  For it to big snug, the door won't close.  That is what causes the banging noise. We're going to try putting someting under the hooks to see if that helps.I included a few pictures below to show what I mean about the fit. You'll have to open them up to get a better view: - Picture 1 : Shows how even when the hangers are positioned so the door will close all the way, it still causes a gap in the front of the door. - Pictures 2 & 3 :  Shows how the door hangers don't fit snug.  If they are snug on the front of the door (so it will close), it is a gap in the back which causes the backboard to not be flush against the door.  This causes the noise. - Picture 4: Again how the door hangers don't fit a standard door.  If they are snug in the front of the door so the backboard is snug, it causes a gap in the front of the door and the door won't close. This makes it impossible to have it fit snug on the back of the door (where it is designed to be) and for it to not bang against the door and make a lot of noise.All in all, it's not a bad set.  I would be better if it actually fit over the door and wasn't so noisy but so far, my son is enjoying it.",4
B001I912SQ,"The rim is very solid. The backboard is extremely flimsy. It works. I was hoping for something more durable. My in-laws have one that is similar, but much stronger. I thought I was buying one like that.",3
B001I912SQ,This is a great indoor basketball hoop. I chose this hoop primarily because of the size. It's larger than most. It's quick and easy to set up. While it does have a dunking mechinisim on the hoop the backboard itself is too flimsy to support it.  We've used this on closet doors and even our front door. We have no issues fully closing the door that it is on and the hoop can fold up if you need to make it more compact for opening a door in tighter spaces! We've loved playing this as a family!,5
B001I912SQ,The clams that you put on a door are very big and will have trouble closing the door highly recommend for someone on a budget and looking for a good mini hoop. The ball came with is also good quality material.,3
B001I912SQ,"Thick plastic, strong hardware. The ball also has a good rubber feel. Survived one teenage boy so far now is in my daughters room.",5
B001I912SQ,"easy to use, great value and fast delivery",5
B001I912SQ,This is great for the inside. We have put it on one of our doors to a bedroom. The sturdiness is great. The ease of assembly is great is perfect for multiple age ranges.,4
B001I912SQ,Good,5
B001I912SQ,My 5-year-old plays with it everyday. It is easy to install but the backboard is a bit soft which makes it hard to goal. I worked around it by putting a cardboard behind it. Worth the money!,5
B001I912SQ,Worked,5
B001I912SQ,i had it for three months nothing wrong with it but it just don't fun anymore,3
B001I912SQ,I bought this for my son for his birthday he loves it. And easy to put together.,5
B001I912SQ,"The SKLZ Pro Mini Basketball Hoop is a well-designed and well-executed product.- Comes with everything that you need to assemble the backboard, including a small wrench to tighten the bolts.  Simple, painless assembly.  (Caution:  Do not overtorque the bolts.  There's really no advantage to tightening the bolts too much, because the included lock nuts will hold securely.  However, overtightening the bolts may induce stress fractures.)- Good attention-to-detail on net and hoop hook points.  Looks nice and works even better.- Foam backing thoughtfully hidden behind backboard border stripes, so that it doesn't detract from the clean appearance of the clear acrylic backboard.- All metal parts have a good ""heft"" to them.  The springloaded hoop is designed to give under pressure.  BUILT TO LAST!- Fits nicely over my son's bedroom door.  It's a tight fit to close the door, so we don't usually close the door - except when we're trying to avoid disturbing Mommy.  (Well ... not disturb her TOO much.  ;-)- At a price point of just over twenty bucks, this is an excellent value.The only thing that I don't like about this product is the ball.  Oh, it is a very high quality ball - one that could be dribbled on a hardwood floor for some serious hoops, just like a regulation ball.  However, inside the home, it's too heavy, too loud, and (potentially) too damaging to walls, windows, and anything else that gets in the way of the errant projectile.  I'd much prefer it if the manufacturer provided a NERF ball, instead.  Although foam balls can't be dribbled, we're just interested in shooting baskets.Bottom line:  The SKLZ Pro Mini Basketball Hoop is an excellent, quality product.  Highly recommended for kids of all ages (including adults!), who like to shoot indoor hoops.  Plan on separately purchasing a foam ball (5"" diameter would be ideal, 4"" diameter will suffice), if safety and sanity are a high priority in your family.P.S.  If you'd like to see what the product looks like in action, just log onto YouTube and search for ""Sklz Mini Hoop"".  There are dozens of clips available.EDIT:  Nearly four years later and the backboard, net, and hoop are still in great condition.  They almost look brand new.  The basketball is a flat now - it still works when pumped up, but loses its air over the course of a few days.  So, we use a Nerf ball, instead.  Still going strong after all these years!",5
B001I912SQ,"Pro's: I'll start by saying this has to be the best basketball hoop available, way better than the plastic one I had growing up. Its well made, the rim is metal, and the basketball looks, feels, and bounces like a real basketball, it even has to be blown up with a pump. If the backboard was glass it would be a scaled down version of the real thing.Con's: Its in the details.1. The rim has 8 hooks, but the net has only 7 loops, so you have to rig the net to work (use two hooks on one loop).2. A back plate is used to attach the rim to the backboard. It was a PITA to attach it because the bolts were too short, to the point where I stripped one of the nuts (6mm) and had to buy a new one. I had to put a bolt through the back then press the rim towards the backboard to squish the foam down on the backplate while trying to thread the nut onto the bolt. Difficult to explain, but those who bought it must know what I am talking about, A simple fix to this would be to make the carriage bolts slightly longer. Currently the carriage bolts are 6mm x 1.0mm x 12mm. They should be 6mm x 1.0mm x 14mm or 16mm.3. It appears the kit used to come with different bolts that went through rim from the front, with the nuts on the backplate, which is what the instructions illustrate. The kit now comes with carriage bolts that go through the backplate with nuts on the front of the rim. The instructions should have been updated to reflect this.If those 3 small issues were fixed, it would easily be a 5 star product, especially for the price. I am disappointed these things weren't discovered by the manufacturer because they are obvious during assembly, especially the bolts being too short. I supposed you could carefully use a clamp or 2 to aid in the install, but the point is it shouldn't be required.",4
B001I912SQ,This was much better quality than I imagined. Thick plexiglass and solid frame. Very pleased.,5
B001I912SQ,"Fits Easily over door. Functions well and sturdy enough. No missing parts or bouncing. Good value, would purchase again.",5
B001I912SQ,"The KLZ Pro Mini Basketball Hoop by SKLZ offers indoor basketball fun with its clear polycarbonate, easy-mounting, shatterproof backboard. This backboard assembles quickly, allowing you to get right into the game. The break-away steel rim adds a sense of realism and safety, while the included 4"" foam mini-ball ensures you can start shooting hoops right away.One feature that might need some improvement is the provided foam, which is a bit too hard and can result in a rather loud playing experience. To mitigate this issue, some users have resorted to creative solutions like using duct tape and socks to dampen the noise. However, it's worth noting that this may not be an ideal solution for everyone.On the positive side, the hoop is sturdy and durable, so there's no need to worry about it breaking during play. Additionally, the padded backing helps protect the mounting door from any potential damage.The heavy-duty, 3-ply net and pro-style replica graphics add to the overall experience, making it an attractive addition to your bedroom or indoor space.In summary, the KLZ Pro Mini Basketball Hoop offers a fun basketball experience for indoor use, but it's essential to be aware of the noise issue caused by the foam. Despite this drawback, its sturdiness and realistic features make it a worthwhile choice for those looking to enjoy some indoor basketball action.",3
B001I912SQ,Use it for classroom management.,5
B001I912SQ,"Got this for both boys for Easter and they both love it, gets constant use.Pro- boys both use it all the time in their rooms. Good for older son to take homework breaks. Con- when they use the rim, it is loud and can be tough on the door. Recommend using additional padding to protect the door.",4
B001I912SQ,"I actually like this thing, but don't look at the backboard on it and think its solid.  Its very flexible, and the rim is heavy and solid steel.  So you could do some damage with this thing if you let kids get out of hand.  I have it hanging on their closet door.  The back is padded with about 1/8"" foam, but I will likely go buy some weatherstripping and add to it.  The rim is pretty cool, and if you broke it, you could definitely re-use it and rig up some garage type mini goal or something.  The tensioned required to pop the little breakaway rim down is enough to bend the back board pretty bad.  So little kids dunking on it, well, I guess we'll see.  Something tells me I'll be re-painting a door down the road.  The little ball it comes with is kind of heavy.  In a bedroom full of stuff, it could do some damage.  I've forbidden the use of it already (because I don't want broken fan globes) and restricted it to foam ball use.  Still, its 4 stars.  I tried to cover the negatives.  Its good, and is roughly the cost of a couple of old nerf hoops.Update - 2/419  Got this at Christmas for the kids.  They broke the backboard this past weekend.  Snapped it in half right above the rim.  Dropped it to 2 stars, because 10yr old kids were able to destroy it.  Although the hardware is still made of metal, and I'll end up going to the hardware store and having a piece of plexiglass cut, get some thick weatherstripping to line the back of that, and reinstall the hardware and rim back to that piece.  Back to the original title - Backboard is not solid if thats what you're thinking.Update 2/19/19 -  Ordered a 1/4"" sheet of 12x18"" plexiglass from Ebay.  Used the broken backboard as a template and drilled out new mounting holes.  Had to use a little longer length screws on the upper mounts than what was on the original, but the original rim nuts/bolts worked fine.  Just have to hit the hardware store for some weatherstripping, but by using the original setup as basically a donor (because I knew it would break), this is going to be a ridiculously awesome bedroom goal.  New backboard is as solid as a piece of plywood.",3
B001I912SQ,We have it as part of decoration for my son rooms. It works good and it has a good quality.,5
B001I912SQ,"My son really likes this SKLZ Pro Mini XL Basketball Hoop. We have taller doors and this is a much better size option.  This is our second one - unfortunately the newer one has a lot less padding than our first one.  My son loves to dunk on it, plus the included ball is a nice quality mini ball.  So we needed to add to the padding.  It would have been 5 stars if they kept the full padding around the full rim.",4
B001I912SQ,This hoop is great! We have this in our living room and it gets heavy play from both my teenagers and my husband. A lot of dunks in this thing and it is still going strong! Highly recommend!,5
B001I912SQ,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He had specifically asked for it; we don't have kids yet, so I knew he wanted it for himself to play with, and I totally gave in.Surprisingly, I love it too!  He played with it for almost 20 minutes before I gave in and started playing also; he was having so much fun, I had to join.The hoop has two wide hooks to hang over a door, but they're thin enough to close the door without creating any scuffs against the door frame.  It's easy to put on the door and remove without creating any damage. In terms of height, I'm 5'8, so once it was hanging on the door, the rim was right above my head with the net coming down to eye-level.If you have people/kids who aren't at a height which allows them to dunk the basketball, then you won't deal with much noise.  If you have a childish, spirited husband like mine who wants to dunk the ball constantly or chuck the ball with all his might, then the backboard will bounce and reverberate against the door VERY loudly.  The backboard has a black cover along the bottom of the board (which you see in the product photos), and that prevents any damage to the door caused by overzealous shooters.The ball is a perfect size; with a lot of these types of products, the ball is always really small, but this one is large enough where you have to use your whole hand to hold it (and my German Shepherd couldn't get his mouth around it to run off with.)  It doesn't have much bounce to it, so you won't have to chase after it much after each shot.We both love this product, and I can't recommend it enough for both kids and adults with the playful attitude of a child.",5
B001I912SQ,"My son loves this thing. He had the glow in the dark version but was constantly dunking on it and it eventually cracked. I ordered the standard version this time and he loves that it looks more like a regular hoop.One thing about this hoop I don't like is the noise it makes when the ball gets thrown in... which I don't think can be avoided, unless the entire back was attached to the wall or something. It's not terribly loud because it has little cushion pieces on the back but the banging sound can get annoying after a while. My tip would be to place it inside your kid's room over the closet door if there's space. We originally had it in the hallway so he could have the open space to play but it is now in his room so he can play whenever he wants without being in the way, AND, most importantly, we don't hear it from the living room.The piece that goes over the door is sturdy enough to hold it in place so it doesn't ever move while playing but it is thin enough that the door can be closed easily. However, I would recommend leaving it open if you can because it may scratch the top of the doorframe like it did mine. I'm sure this is more due to my son's roughness but I do wish it had some cushion to help this.All in all, this hoop is still worth it. My son loves loves loves it.",4
B001I912SQ,"Being a basketball freak and just about all I do is basketball related in my spare time I had to purchase the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop XL (which is the correct product name). Growing up I wish there was a product like this but all I had was the cheap NERF door-hanging mini hoops. I had seen the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop at Sports Authority and Target, but it is hard to find the XL model. I love it so far and my son and I have had many hours of play on it in just the 4 weeks since the purchase was made. There are just a few drawbacks and suggestions I have for the makers at SKLZ: while the Clear Polycarbonate Shatter-Proof Backboard is durable and sturdy the backboard should be thicker by at least 1/8"" if not more because the backboard bends when ""Break-Away"" Steel Rim is pulled down; the mini basketball included doesn't have the Pro Mini XL logo on it; and lastly the ""Break-Away"" Steel Rim is only 9"" in diameter while the SKLZ Pro Mini basketball is 5 1/2"" in diameter which doesn't add up to scale because any basketball player or enthusiast knows that two basketballs fit side-by-side inside of a normal basketball hoop. The people at SKLZ should have made the rim 11"" in diameter if the basketball is going to be 5 1/2"" in diameter, which in turns seems to make the ball appear too heavy for the rim. If this is helpful I am extremely glad, but remember I am a basketball nut so the little things matter to me. Now, if you want to have some indoor basketball fun this would be an excellent purchase.P.S.I wish SKLZ would send mounting material for top and bottom in order to mount it on the wall. As is mounted on the wall the top would be the only area attached. Also, the more the break-away the rim the rim becomes loose from the backboard and I have had to re-tighten the rim twice in the last month.",4
B001I912SQ,"I bought this for my classroom.  Easy to put together.  BUT the net was not put together correctly and it's just a mess.  I would love to get a hold of the manufacturer but all I could do was send back the whole contraption- which I don't want to do.  If not for the net, I would give it 5 stars.",3
B001I912SQ,"Our trampoline came with a really crappy foam hoop, which I decided to replace with this one.  I kept the original mount and backboard support and used them to modify the goal and it worked perfectly.  I did have to carefully place and drill 8 holes in the backboard in order to mount it and insure good support.  The XL version fit perfectly to the old backboard supports and I just screwed them in using metal screws and locking nuts.  The backboard and hoop are pretty responsive and my kids love it.  It does wobble a little still, but thats from the trampoline pole and jumping.  I did have to use the old net backboard to try and cover the lower gap so the ball didn't get thrown out constantly, but overall I am very pleased with how it turned out.",5
B001I912SQ,"I think it's a great quality hoop.  My kids (8 and 11 years old) have had it for about 5 months and have given the rim and backboard a solid beating.  I have it hanging from a couple of 2x4's that I drilled into wall studs to make this thing solid.  (There weren't any doors placed in a good spot for the 2 goons to run around and get their inner Shaquille O'Neal on.)  The backboard is flexible and if the rim springs reach their max bending limit, the backboard will bend out to avoid breaking.  The rim is solid and a quality metal.  The only reason I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5 is because the older goon did prove that it was breakable.  After bending the snot out of it for months while playing on it, I guess he bent it down too far (any hanging on the rim was with their feet on the ground), and the bottom part of the backboard did finally develop a horizontal crack right above the rim.  It didn't shatter, and it didn't separate, so even with breaking, I consider it to be a good, safe way to break....but, the rim was left hanging there dangling.  Again, I still think the product is high quality, but my kids treat items like this as if they were the old gorillas tossing around Samsonite luggage from the old-school commercials.  (If that reference is lost on you, youtube ""gorillas samsonite"" and you'll get the idea.)  I'm actually on here ordering a new one for my son's birthday because they loved it so much.",4
B001I912SQ,"Update to my review below: I contacted the company and explained exactly what happened.  Although the product was past the warranty date they offered to replace it this time.  They mentioned that the materials have been updated so the hope is that it is more durable.  So, up my 2 star rating to a 5 for GREAT customer service and making my son pretty happy when the replacement arrived in the mail!_______________________ original review:I actually don't want to give this a 2-star rating because Amazon interprets this as, ""I don't like it"".  That isn't the case - my son LOVED it.  I guess it is true that I don't like it because the backboard broke suddenly and shockingly after about 1 year and 3 months of use, and took away all the fun my son was having it.  I don't like that part.  But, this is a super fun and inexpensive toy for lots of ages.  I would say more days than not I could hear the noise of the rim springing around and the ball bouncing - making it one of the more successful toys we ever bought for him.It held up for that 15 months to lots of play mostly by 11 & 12 year old boys, once in a while some girls and a few parents.  I guess the $25 we paid was somewhat reasonable but bummer it broke.  The backboard broke all the way across above the rim.I'd like to buy another, but since he's only getting older and stronger I have to question whether we'd even get the same amount of time out of it before it breaks again.",4
B001I912SQ,Loves it but it is noisy,5

B0BZ8MB4KM,"This was a Christmas gift for my 20-year-old son. I saw that there were cheaper knock-off versions, but since it was a gift, I figured I'd spring for the brand name. It was a hit during our Christmas gathering. 4 generations (from 6 to 75) had fun trying it out, and it didn't take much time for most everyone to become moderately successful at it (the one exception being my husband, bless his heart). Made for a lot of laughs and blackmail videos! We did not use the app. It was a good novelty purchase -- not sure how much use it will get in the future. $30 is a bit much for what you get though. I'm not sure how the quality of the knock-off versions compares to this, but I might advise going for one of them if you're in the market.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"Santa brought this to my son for Christmas this year and it has not disappointed. My son loves it and it gets him doing something other than mundane indoor activities such as television or video games. I also have become quite fond of it and walk around the house with it attached to my head, ready at a moment's notice to engage in some quality fun/hand-eye coordination.It is a simple gadget at a fair price point that provides good entertainment. The competition is also unmatched, getting to see who can get the most consecutive hits. You can gage you're level of progression with the app as well and see how well you match up with others from around the world.In all, I reccomend this product and would definitely purchase again.",5
B0BZ8MB4KM,"I asked Santa for this and,  unsurprisingly, it was with my stocking. I brought it into the living room the day after Christmas and started using it while my son was watching TV.  Within 5 minutes he asked to try and went at it for 20 minutes, then again 2 more times during the day. I'm honestly worried he may be sore tomorrow.I didn't download the app, but did watch the video that has a link on the box. Follow the video and you should be fine. We went from being unsuccessful twits to successful twits (hitting the ball 20 times in a row) with 15 minutes of practice.  My son was even able to land a number of hard shots.The ball and string don't feel like very high quality so I don't know how long they will last. But, at this price, I'm willing to buy another if it's being used.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"It's exactly what you think it is an elastic/nylon headband with an elastic string string with a tethered ball. I was hoping for how much I was seeing this advertised the app would have more to it. Like a open faced leader board, a challange system, a forum where you could talk trash amongst friends or random strangers. Make events that if you had something like a clan feature where everyone on your team has an hour to max out how many hits they can get in a time frame and make it interactive...sounds more interesting than what I recieved and have experienced...quality of everything is decent...but there aren't many bells and whistles possible other than a more durable tether with different options for length so you don't have to adjust a knot everytime and hope you don't hit it to hard once and the distance of the tether extends making your timing almost impossible or speed enhancements be kind of a mystery.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Lots of fun!  My 20 year old about drove me crazy playing.  Great for eye hand coordination.  The app is pretty useless.  Fun for any age.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,We had a lot of fun with this.  Actually bought it because we dirt track race and wanted to improve on our reaction times.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"I purchased this for my 11-year-old grandson for Christmas. The boxed arrived on time but it was a lot smaller than what I expected, approximately 3 1/2 by 3 1/2.  For the price of $29 and another $5 for shipping, handling, and taxes, it didn't seem like a good deal.  It's just a headband with a string and a ball attached to it.  The object is to hit the ball while it is attached to the string and headband. However, my grandson seems to like it and finds it entertaining, so I gave it 4 1/2 stars.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"My favorite toy I have ever had. I use it for physical therapy to recover from Guillain-Barre syndrome and my longest streak is up to 630 without missing. This is the one of the best, most fun things I have ever done. I feel like a kid again and I use it every day. Pro tip: use with music and you can punch to the beat.",5
B0BZ8MB4KM,Kids loved it!  We had to adjust the length for some of us shorter armed people...:),4
B0BZ8MB4KM,This is fun for any age and any activity level.  The app works okay but might lag a little (probably based on your internet speed).  The product is as described.  My family played this for a long time on Christmas Day and we laughed and really had a good time.  The shipping was fast and product arrived in a small box.  This game is very portable and easy to play!  Fun for all!!,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Fun not quite what I expected after seeing advertisements.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Fun for a very short time. Grand children lost interest fast.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Bought this product to improve hand / eye coordination. It was easy to use right off. Downloaded the app to provide hit count accuracy and it worked well. It is compact so I will be able to pack it when traveling to provide a fu workout in the road. Good workout regardless of age or athletic ability.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,There were no instructions. Bought as a Christmas activity. Took the youngest member of our family to realize you have to roll up the string on the headband to get it in the right position,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"After receiving the Product, I did feel it was a bit overpriced for what you receive. However, it's a nice novelty item that actually has some redeeming factors as far as physical activity...",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Great fun gift. Bought for my grandson. Whole family enjoys.  Great exercise.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,I think it is great fun and glad I purchased it but at the same time I could only give it a 4 because it is priced too high.  With so many other options out there at a much better cost I only got it for the app but only used it a few times.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,My grandson is in Martial Arts and loves this !!! He can actually take it with him and when he has down time out it comes !!!  Highly recommend for kids with the need to go go go .... entertainment and skill s,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,I really liked it. But the string seemed a bit long so I'll take a little off & it should be okay,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"This is a fun game and, hopefully, will aid as a fitness tool.  It is good for hand / eye coordination.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Liked it very much fun to keep it going.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,My boyfriend likes it the only thing is the string is a bit long. It looks like it is probably for a person with longer arms. Overall great gift idea.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"I bought 3 different games from 3 buffet companies. This one came with the least stuff, balls, headbands but cost the most. Other than price for what I received was great.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,The string is a little long as i am only 5ft tall but in the introduction they tell you how to shorten it but let me tell you this is very addicting and challenging once you get the hang of it it is so much fun and a good cheap workout!,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Bought this for my 8 year old grandson.  A little difficult to use for him but he liked it.  The older kids liked it,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"We had fun seeing who could do this! Then I ce you get it, it is quite fun!",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Great gift for those who like a challenge. One size fits most for a functional body workout and entertaining exercise.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"fun game  if you can actually hit the ball. Not really made for kids though, the string is quite long and they can't reach it. Got a lot of laughs out of it !",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"This is fun for all ages! It gets you up and moving.  Our kit did not come with a bag though :(. I bought others as gifts, I hope they came with the bag.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"In addition to being a bit of a workout, this item is a lot of fun. Especially the first few times you try to use it. Gonna get one for the kids!",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Really good game to play my biggest complaint is it does not come with actual directions just how to hook it up to your phone and TV,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,EXCELLENT GIFT  They all had so much fun  could not have gotten anything that would have been played with more and had more fun,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,Husband loves it! Mom is trying to love hers! She is a Pickle Ball player at 80 years old! She will probably beat my husband!,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"The string is longer than necessary, but easy to fix. Takes a bit of hand eye coordination for sure. Overall, we had fun with it",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,I bought 3 of them and they want to charge $20 to return them.I'm glad I did not return it because they were a hit!  Everyone loved them and they worked great!,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Gave one to each of our families. They it good and challenging. Value for product is over priced,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Gave this to my 10 year old grandson for Christmas.  I don't think he ever removed it from his forehead for the duration of the holiday.  He loved it.  PS - I did too!,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,Great tool to build coordination. App was okay. We used app first day but not worth the hassle.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"for what was paid expected better quality, also expected more",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Where was this when I was a kid??? My 13 year old son loves this. He has been playing non-stop. We have the app and its fun to keep track of the hits he can do and the fun mini games. The one thing I dont like is that there is a chat option on the app to chat with other users and I am not able to block that or turn it off. I removed the app from his phone and he still has a blast with the ball. I will be ordering it for birthdays for friends. What a great idea!,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,"Fun and a workout! My grandson loves it,  and we have fun trying to advance how many punches he can get in. Great hand & eye coordination training.  I highly recommend it.",5
B0BZ8MB4KM,I bought this item as a gift.  Thought the price point was high.  My grandson will be surprised at what has come in such a tiny box.I will just have to wait to evaluate ease of assembly and his interest in this product.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"Harder than it looks, fun for all.",4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Kids love competition toys. This is one that the little guy can beat the big girl at :),4
B0BZ8MB4KM,It was for my grandson Jack so far he likes it but time will tell,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Fun product but which there was a better way to adjust the string,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,It's fun and challenging but can make you dizzy if you do it too long.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Got Boxbollen as a stocking stuffer gift and I love it!  Great for mental sharpness and dexterity practice.  Takes a while to become  capable but it is fun to practice and improve.  I fear the elastic thread holding the ball to the headstrap is too flimsy and will soon break but it has held up so far.  Everyone in the family has tried it.,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,I bought this as a gag gift and it is a lot of fun to play with.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,My 21 year old son loved this thing!!  He had a blast and it also gave a link to a video to learn to use it fast.Great exercise too while having fun!,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,Fun easy indoor game to help build hand eye coordination.  As advertised.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Grandson loves it,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,My grandson loves it but be aware it counts by the sound of you hitting the ball so not always accurate,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Great gift for parties! Wished I bought 2 or 4Mike G,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,It's a fun workout,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,I don't know how something is simple could be so fun.,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,I kept seeing this on Instagram and liked the convenience of purchasing on Amazon and arriving same day. My 10 and 11 year boys have fun putting the app on the tv and competing. Definitely a learning curve but happy that will help them with hand and eye coordination.,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,easy to use for fun and laughs,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Such a cheap fun Christmas present.  Son loves playing it.,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,Easy to use. Bought it to workout with music and increase my hand eye coordination,4

B0BZ8MB4KM,Kids enjoy it but it is over priced,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Simple to set up and use. Was easy to start to use.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,I gave it to my grandson for Christmas. He loved it.,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,Fun and a great workout! The whole family loves it!,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,I would like to keep this item and will accept the price for it. I know I am paying for 2 items.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,as expected,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"I didn't view the instructional video, so maybe I am doing something wrong.  With respect to being for beginners I guess you have to start somewhere, but I had experience with Title's string ball(s).  I was able to start with the larger ball and work my way down to the smallest.  I was able to use this one immediately and I noticed that due to the length of the string I had to hit it a bit harder and not necessarily faster.  I believe because I was hitting it a bit harder and I broke the strings on the two that I purchased.  However, both were replaced immediately.11/01/2023 - Update.  So far so good on the two replacement ones that I received.  I find these extremely fun to use and using them does provide some form of exercise especially went trying to see how many times you can hit the ball in 5 or 10s.  My high so far is 27, however, I try and maintain a traditional orthodox boxer's stance.  I lead with my left and use a jab and then right cross.  I utilize that full length of the elastic string so it is unlikely that I will every break 40 in 10s.  If I do, I will record and upload with the app.Update - 01/08/2024I wanted to provide a final review for the two of these that I bought.  I have used bought and I have literally beat the heck out of both of them and I have not had a single issue with either.  I have let others use them and they really enjoy it.  As a matter of fact I am to order another one for a 9 year family member.  Unfortunately the ones that I ordered are currently unavailable.  However, it appears there are others available so I will purchase that brand and hopefully they are as good as these have been.  These are a great alternative to the ones sold by Title Boxing, which run $50 or $60 plus shipping.  I own a Title one as well and I perfer the Boxbollen over the much more expense one from Title Boxing.  The velcro head band seems to be made for people of all head sizes, whereas the one from Title seems to be made for big heavyweight fighters like Wladimir Klitschko who has a massive head.  I hope the Boxbollen are available again soon, despite having as issue with the first two I purchased the free replacements have held up much better than I expected.  You do not need to be pro to use these, my wife and son were both able to pick up and start using it within 5 to 10 minutes..  My son has zero eye to hand coordination.  It just takes time and patiences to use these.",5
B0BZ8MB4KM,as advertised,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,More fun and challenging than i expected!,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Three generations loved playing with this toy,5
B0BZ8MB4KM,They need to make this for pre-teens also.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,Easy to use and adjust for all ages.,4
B0BZ8MB4KM,"Fun, but can't figure out how to keep score on the tv through the ap, like the ads show.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I needed some earbuds that would stay in while I workout, work in the yard, etc. and knew I wanted some that hooked over my ears.  I was eyeing the Beats earbuds but felt they were a little pricey.  I decided to give these a try as they are very similar in design but for much less. I figured if I didn't like them, I hadn't lost much.  But wow, I am so impressed by these!  They fit perfectly!  Very snug in my ear and they never come out or need adjusting like my Samsung Galaxy earbuds do.  The sound quality is excellent and they were easy to pair with my Android phone.  They say that they are noise cancelling, but I don't know if that is supposed to be active noise cancelling or if they are considered noise cancelling because of how snugly they fit in my ears.  They don't show up on my ""wearable"" app on my phone, which is how I would activate noise cancelling on my other earbuds.  But they fit so well within my ear, that it hasn't really been an issue.  Also, the charge lasts a LONG time.  I only use them for about an hour or two every day when I work out.  I charged them right after I received them (about 3 weeks ago), and haven't had to recharge them yet.  They are so worth the money.  If you are hesitant to buy them, don't be.  I can't believe how well these perform.  Definitely worth it!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Im a mobilediesel mechanic and I always struggle to find good, low cost earbuds. I'm always answering and making calls in the field and I usually keep one in all day long.  I used to use the STADOR brand but can't find them anymore. These are even better than those. The only thing different is you can't use these as a battery bank. But that's not a big issue. They stay charged forever. They have YET to die on me through the day, we're talking 14, 16 hour days. They have amazing sound quality. During calls , the other person can hear me perfectly and they come in loud and clear. You can be a good distance from your device and still have your stuff playing or be on your call. They stay on your ear, extremely comfortable to wear. I still haven't even had to charge the case yet and I've had them for a couple weeks now. These are my new GO to buds. I lose earbuds constantly so that's why I try for lower cost ones. You will not be disappointed!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Recommend for media, not for callsI got these to go wireless on my computer. I have no regrets at all! In fact, shortly after, I bought a set for my other computer.First off, the quality of sound is great, both incoming and from what my friend told me, also outgoing through the mic (On the PC). He could hear me fine and I had no idea I was using the headset mic on discord until he told me. When I listen to music, it may not be the Beats or Big Brand quality, but it's definitely nothing to scoff at. Great and balanced sound.Where these headphones stand out, though, are in how well they hold a charge and the charging system in general. I have been using them for a few months now. I have yet to have them die on me. The longest gaming session I had was 8 hours and the PC was saying they were at full charge. I think that was a bug, but even then, for 8 hours with no charge needed, its really not bad, especially for the price.For the comfort, again, they are really comfortable to where I forgot they were on. Even after 8 hours. The ear loop is soft, but firm and holds them in place. I have used them for listening to music on my phone while working out and they don't fall off or even feel like they will. They are not great for outdoor running as the wind still comes through as they don't have that extremely tight fit, but that could just be my ears/bud fit.They are built strong. I can't attest for how long the charger itself holds as I generally have it sitting at the computer desk, plugged in. The only issue I had is that the few people I tested with for calls from the phone said it was horrible. They couldn't hear me and I kept cutting in and out.Overall, I highly recommend these for PC or workout use. Truly worth the money.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I recieved these ear buds today and they are so comfortable you don't know youre wearing them !!  They fit over the ears perfectly. The clarity of the music and bass is awesome and it was simple to set them up with blue tooth. I wore them for over 3 1/2 hours while working outside and going to the gym . You can wear them with glasses or sun glasses. Absolutely no discomfort and they never moved once. Amazing for the sale price, right now for 24.99. Whenever I get a good deal and am happy with what  I purchase I want everyone to know ! Over 10,000 positive reviews says it all !!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"These earbuds are perfect. The sound quality is definitely 5 stars. They charge very quickly. The sound has an internal base boost that causes me to turn the volume down because its base is so intense. The ear loops are perfectly made. The over the ear hooks are secure. They do not hurt or stretch causing the ear bud to fall from my ears. The over the ear hooks does not hurt while wearing eye glasses. I have worn to the gym and the earbuds remains securely snug in place. Even while sweating, there is not an interruption in sound quality. I like the sleek color. They are easily paired with my Android. Others have commented the sound qaulity is clear when talking on the phone. My only negative is the charging port. The charging cord is very short. Luckily, I had a longer charging cord on hand. I plan to make a second purchase in a different color. These earbuds were definitely worth the money I paid.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"See Update at end, no more pain:Almost all reviews have no problem with the fit of these earbuds, but for me, they hurt. Not unbearably so, but it would be nice to not feel any discomfort at all. I tried changing the tips, adjusting the angle in my ear and also tried leaving loosely outside of ear canal, but always have noticeable discomfort. Plus if I leave them loose, I lose sound quality, so I don't like doing that. Would like to take away two stars but only removing one because these are really good earbuds otherwise for the price. I have never run out of power. Usually when I recharge the case, it doesn't even need recharging. I just do it to go back up to 100%. Despite the fact that I can feel them, it's not excruciating pain, so I do use them often. I just have to keep playing around with other tips and other means of making them more comfortable for me.The case is very attractive. In fact, someone saw my case with buds and commented, ""Wow, those are nice!""  I don't mind the size. I think it might be the reason the charge lasts so long. If you cut a deck of cards in half and placed on top of each other, that's about the size of the case. The earbuds themselves are attractive but also bulky. Maybe all earhook buds are bulky, I don' t know as these are my first. I wish they had skintone colors to make them less noticeable. I ordered rose gold thinking they would be less noticeable, but should've just gone with black. The sound quality, to me, is exceptional. I use for listening to music, to lessons, and have used for TV. I have not used for phone calls because I rarely use these thru my phone.I have owned these for about 3 months now and am still getting used to the different button taps. I'm used to power, pair, pause, fast forward and back, but have to practice a little more on volume up and down.So there you have it. If they didn't hurt a little and the earbuds weren't so bulky, they'd be perfect.Update:I finally figured out how to stop the pain which was getting really bad to point where I felt like I was getting a sore. I put them on one day without looking and later realized no more pain. What I didn't realize was that although I had placed the buds firmly in my ear, the earhooks were not hooked behind my ear. Instead they were just resting on my ear. I'll try to add a picture later. Even though not hooked behind my ear, they were still secure with absolutely no discomfort. Who knew?!!The other thing is I was streaming music on my phone for hours at work and walked away thinking the phone was in my pocket. Very large building and I went very far away. Phone was not in my pocket but the music never stopped.And last thing, I said I don't use for phone calls, but another time while streaming music, a call came in. The music stopped for the call. It was seamless. I was at home and went into a different room away from phone and could still have the conversation.Changing to 5 stars",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"These are great earbuds. They are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned. I work in a 4000 sq ft machine shop and I'm constantly moving. These earbuds stay in my ears and there is only a little discomfort at the end of the day after wearing them non-stop for 8 hours. I've had zero issues with the buds trying to fall out.I was somewhat disappointed in the sound quality at first. Every song had maracas in it. After installing a good equalizer app, the sound quality was much better. Don't expect miracles, but they do sound pretty darned good to me now.The earbuds pair quickly, are easily manipulated for volume and skips, and they receive my WiFi signal throughout an entirely metal building with no windows without any drop outs.This is a good value and I'm very happy with these.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"BLUETOOTH 100/10Super easy to connect, have no had a single issueBATTERY LIFE 10/10Love the battery life, they haven't died on me at all and they charge up pretty fastCOMFORT 8/10So, this was partially my fault, I had forgotten that my industrial piercing would get in the way and it does cause some discomfort after a while, but my other ear does not have a piercing, and honestly these are so comfortable but I do notice they are on versus an earbud that you kind of forget it's in.VOLUME 12/10These babies get LOUD, you don't have to turn them all the way up at all, I am consistently at less than half on my volume bar and I usually have to turn my pixel buds allll the way up to hear well. I can take both out and use as a tiny little speaker they are so loud/NOISE CANCELING 10/10When I have both of these babies in I can't hear a thing. Especially when my music is going and I am working, of course the louder you have your music the less you will hear. If you just have them in with no sound you can hear okay-ish, just kind of muffled. (But just be careful you might need to hear something for emergencies, if there was someone screaming I wouldn't be able to hear it. Usually on construction site/home remodel I leave one off for safety)Bass 10/10All I'm saying is your ears will vibrate from the bass, even at a lower volume.EASE OF USE 8/10I like that they are physical buttons versus touch, BUT in order to click in you have to press pretty hard so you are shoving this thing straight into your ear so I found that if you hold onto the sides and press it doesn't hurt.I will say volume controls are a little weird and take a while to respond, also skipping songs and replaying another song does take getting used to. I usually always control with my phone because it's faster.Double tap = Next songTriple Tap = Google AssistantHold left button for volume downHold right for volume upYou cannot change the volume if you have just one earbud inTruly a plug and play, they connected to my Bluetooth instantly.If you are looking for a cheap set of earbuds, these are it, stop looking, they are adorable and they WORK!They remind me of the early 2000's see through plastic electronics, so cool. The case is bulky but I kind of like it, it tells you on the display screen what your battery life is, c type charging.These are perfect for anyone who has had trouble with keeping an earbud in, and if your ear canal gets aggravated, just let it dangle from your ear, you can still hear and your ear canal gets a break.I am comparing my experience with the Google Pixel Buds 2, I loved them when I first bought them but they have not lasted the test of time for me, and they constantly die on me, and my ears get itchy and irritated after wearing them.I just wanted an easy cheap replacement and I got one, very happy with my purchase.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"Wow...just WOW!  I've been devoted to my JBL earbuds that I purchased roughly 18 months ago, but recently, they've been beeping at me for some reason, and starting with a full charge, one earbud will eventually cut off after using them for a Zoom call for only an hour.  This was a blind purchase for me, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but they arrived thoughtfully packaged, fully charged and ready to go.  I've never had over-the-ear earbuds, so I can't provide any comparisons, but I can say that the over-the-ear piece is soft and easily molds to your ear shape; I can't even tell after a couple of hours of wearing them, that they're there.  Not that I would try running - unless someone was chasing me - and if that ever happened, I could wear these wireless ear buds and not be concerned that they would fall out!  They paired quickly and easily, I didn't even have to do anything for that process to complete itself; I simply opened the case.  The sound is solid and clear, and the bass and treble are balanced.  I haven't read the manual, so I'm not sure if they are adjustable at this point, but for me, no adjustments are needed.  I can even hear chords that I don't normally hear through our JBL PartyBox or my car stereo.  Total win with this purchase!  These wireless earbuds are legit, and I can 100% recommend!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Alright, I've had these for 6 months so far and have used them almost everyday, nearly all day long. Battery life is great, they charge up quickly in the case, the case charges extremely fast, sound quality is great. They play music and my audiobooks without any complaints by me. I'm not an audiophile, just a regular person with regular people needs when it comes to audio quality.My one gripe is that I cant change the volume except with my phone because I have to wear just one at work since I have to keep an ear out for safety reasons and machinery making weird sounds.I lost one of the ear pieces recently and found it in the dryer after it ran through the wash with my work clothes. Figured it was toast, but I threw it in the case for a sec, pulled it out, and it connected to my phone with the same audio quality it had before. If it can survive my sweat in the summer, and a run through the washer then the dryer on medium heat, I'd say this brand is more rugged than they give themselves credit for.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I have small ears and had tried some standard ones, but all they did was fall out constantly. So, I got these instead. They glide on and typically stay put, but if they do pop out, they don't fall off. Problem solved!They do block out noise since they fit snugly in my ears, so I just use one when I'm out and about.When I hop in my car, it takes control away from the buds and when I'm getting out of the car, I just manually switch back to the buds if I'm on a call. Pretty simple.Sound quality is good and others seem to be able to hear me fine. My case came almost completely charged and I haven't had to recharge it yet!I'm happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Sound quality is very good, especially for the price, and setup is easy if you read drawings. Not so easy if you read text instructions. I have ears that spit out earbuds constantly, but these sit comfortably and securely, so lightweight I forgot I had them on several times. And this was with the default caps, which I usually change immediately for the smallest offered. While I thought the sound level was a bit low, it was comfortable, well-within the safety decible range, and I got used to it. I did like the way I could hear outside sounds well enough to feel safe as I walked outside; I am a stickler for not impeding sensory input when outdoors or in public places--a vigilance habit as a retired first responder. The one star detracted from my rating was because the supplied charging cable would not connect with the case which charges the earbuds; I had to scrounge for an unused Apple cable to make it work. Since I cannot find a way to contact the seller directly, I'm reporting it here. I can only hope my online searches for how-to's will let me know how to connect these to my iPhone and Macbook Pro at the same time.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"These are AWESKOME when it comes to noise cancellation, in-ear stability, and sound quality. Before buying, I used the AirPods Pro, then replaced with Beats Audio Sport. These are great, probably better than the Apple products that I mentioned. I have unique ear-holes ( I guess) so the others would constantly fall out or become loose. If your'e anything like me, there's nothing worse than pushing the limit while your power song is playing, getting lost in the determination/burn, and the earbud pops out. AAAAAAH!I like these so far (hell, I  took the time to write a review  because they are decent). They fit snug, sound quality is good, and I don't feel like they are going to slip out.Pros: Sound Cancellation ( I can't hear the anything while working out), Snug fit.Cons:  1. I have been told that sound quality during phone calls (I only had one) is crap/bad on the receiving end.2. The case is pretty large. About twice the size (see attached) of Apple Pro/Beats.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"This was the 2nd pair of these I bought on Amazon.I bought these for communication, not music.They both paired easily with a Roku and my NUC computer. The sound is quite crisp and distortion free.The fit is good, and range is as expected for a BT device.The life of the battery is very good, going well over 6 hours continuously with plenty of capacity left.The charging case is exceptionally convenient, with the magnetic drop in of the ear buds and numeric read out of the charge state of the case.Only one Con: (and it doesn't affect the actual operation of the Ear Buds)While it is nice that they included a type C USB charging cable, it really does not fit well to charge the case. It is very tight and slightly angled up from the horizontal and I'm not comfortable using it. Two other cables I have on hand fit more much easily and don't have the uptilt.I would recommend these for listening to Podcasts and Ham Radio use, I did not evaluate them with music.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I bought these to use with my cell phone because my new phone does not come with an audio jack.For $25, these seemed reasonable, so I decided to give them a try. They are more comfortable than I expected - I have been wearing them for about 6 hours so far today and they don't hurt. I also wore them to breakfast this morning, and was comfortably able to leave my phone on the table while walking to the hotel buffet, maybe 30 or so feet away, with no loss of audio. So far my biggest annoyance has been trying to hand off from my phone to the work computer (I had to turn off bluetooth on the phone before the computer could find the headphones), and a weird tendency for the headphones to connect to the the music the hotel is playing down in the lobby...",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I  bought these back in August to replace my old headphones. Choose to go with a different design since i normally use wired blue tooth ear buds. What brought to write these review is that, last weekend i was doing laundry and i heard a sound coming from the washing machine.. Come to find out i forgot to pull the case and ear buds out of my work pants. They were fully submerged in water for about 5-10 mins being thrown around in my washer. Pulled them out and let them dry thinking they wouldn't work. Yesterday i plugged them in for the first time to recharge the battery.. They still work, connected to my phone, and the audio quality was just as good as it was before. Time will tell too see how well the batteries last, but for them to still work really impressed me since they are ""cheaper"" ear buds.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I'm very happy with the quality, and everything about these wireless ear buds! I didn't give it 5 stars because the instruction booklet was in tiny print, hard to read, and didn't contain enough information on the product. AND I have noticed a distortion in the sound where its unbalanced, with too much Treble (which gets worse when u adjust the volume up) and little or no distinctive Bass sound to balance it out, adjusting the balance on my phones audio volume...makes no difference in the sound quality coming out of these ear buds. And there's no adjustment feature on the ear buds themselves. So if you like it loud, be prepared for the music to screech a bit. That would be the only thing I would change in this product. Otherwise the quality is great!",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I bought these as a back up to my new Durongfang earbuds.  The sound is great but trying to change out the rubber nubby things was very frustrating.  I have very small ear openings and ear canals so I have to use the smallest whatever they are called.  Otherwise, I am constantly having to push them back in.  It took a ridiculous amount of time to get each one changed out. Other than that, they feel good and the sound is great.  The wrap around aspect is great so they feel more secure and I don't have to worry about losing one.  Would definitely recommend.  Would give it a little lower than a 5 if I could due to the nubby things but they deserve a high rec for sure.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Very surprised at the quality of these earbuds. Bluetooth connects very quickly once taken out of the charging case. The charging time is excellent. I wear the earbuds most of a 14 hour day and the charging case has yet to go down below 50% at the end of the day. The sound quality of my phone calls are great. No complaints from the person hearing me from the far end. Audio quality from music and videos are very good, and isolation when you really need it is fairly good as well by tightening the fit. All around great product!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"So, my original plan was to wait until the battery died to leave a review but it's been a month and a week and the case is only at 47% soooooo lolI don't usually use them heavily, but I'll listen with one earbuds for about an hour a day on average. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Usually just audiobooks or YouTube and the volume at half way or less.Even my Samsung earbuds case only goes for about 4 days with this kind of usage!They're comfortable. I was worried how they'd sit on my ear since I also wear glasses and a hat at work, but they're fine. I have to sort of wiggle them into position, but once I get them sitting right with my glasses and hat they're there and aren't budging.The sound is decent. I'm no audiophile, but they sound clear and loud. I love that there's a tactile button on them instead of just a touchscreen.Really, the only downfall is how big the case is. It's about the size of the palm of my hand minus the fingers and it's thick. So, it doesn't fit comfortably in a pocket and probably not at all in my girl-pants with tiny pockets. But that doesn't bother me.All in all, I think these are my favorite headphones that I've ever had. I'm still waiting on the case to get completely to 0% before charging it, but with the way that it's going that'll be another month of use! Lol if I remember, I'll update the review with how long it takes.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I am not usually a fan of ear buds, as I have a lot of comfort issues with my ears. However, I was looking for something I can use to listen to podcasts or music while I'm out on walks. This one seemed to have good ratings, so I gave them a chance.After two uses, I am a fan.In addition to the sleek aesthetics, I am really pleased with how these sit on my ears. I wore them for nearly two overs and had no issues with how they felt. The sound quality for both spoken voices and music was very good. I can see myself using these every day!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"One of the Best items I bought off of Amazon! I use them for Audible walking and projects when I want to focus and not be disturbed by outside noise.  They aren't cumbersome like my headphones.  Clarity surpassed my expectations.  I could still hear cars and people saying ""Hi"".  I love the color. I got RoseGold.People have no clue I am wearing them. Boy, do they stay charged.Also they have 3 sets of ear buds.  They come with medium on them.  The fit was great.I guess I got a great set because I've really enjoyed mine.  I've had no problems to date.  I am keeping these on a gift list for the future, too.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I have purchased several different earphones. Never want to spend a lot on them. I always like the ones with ear hook. They usually break or get lost eventually.These are easily the best I have had. The battery life of both the case and the individual pieces is outstanding. Sound is good. For the price, these are great!I just returned an $80 pair of Google Pixel A buds because they would not stay in my ear and the battery life was pitiful. At about a third of the cost, I consider these to be about 100x better.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Great value, easy to use.  Instructions were easy to follow.  Comes with extra tips (covers) of different sizes.Best feature - the case actually charges the earbuds.  It has a battery reserve, and a ""percent charged"" gauge.  The buds are supposed to last up to 15 hours, and the case should provide to to 75 hours of use.  I can't attest to that just yet, but so far so good.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I didn't prepare to give this type of an analogy I remember as a child I probably didn't make the best choice of selected friends.  Granted they were idolized, but behind the scene they were far from desired. But then there's that one good friend who may not be the most popular, but the friendship develops into an authentic connection. I have went with the trends purchasing high priced earbuds that's trending on the market.  All of them has disappointed me in some way.  These aren't the best sound quality, but the Balance; perfection and the Noise Cancellation is a 10! They fit  uniquely.  Primarily used for sleep and meditation; they did not fall out and remained comfortable.  Price ranked about  2.5/3  ($10-$85). These wireless earbuds has impressed me by far: Wireless headgear purchase # 7!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Would absolutely buy again. The sound quality is great. The case charges the buds, so they're always ready to go. They stay in during intense workouts. They clean up easily. The sound is good enough that I can listen to spoken word audio while mowing.The only remaining question is longevity, which is only answered by time. But at the price, I'd buy a new pair every year if I have to.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Good earbuds, excellent value.The case makes it a better system than others.The case is extra helpful.1) LED with # percent charge on the case's battery.  Know how much battery charge remain in the case, can plan ahead.2) Moving bars shows recharging on each earpiece.  Know when the recharge is done.Hooks over your ear.Speakers fit inside ear-canal. Extra tips included.Recommended.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"But these if you like super fast pairing. For me with my Samsung S24 ultra it's < 1sec. Connection distance is great, about 30-35 feet.  Sound is good for this price. The battery life is excellent. For me something like 10-12 hours on a single charge. The ear loop fit is very comfortable. Not too loose or too tight. Snug for in ear but not too tight. The clear case is nice so you can see if the ear buds are in the case or not. I love that because I often use one earbud at a time. I hope this helps someone. I pretty much only buy ear buds in the sub$30 range and these are among the best. I purchased in Jan 2025.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Love these and they paired up so beautifully and the same with my phone calls.  It is just so nice to have this be so easy.  I am going to have to get used to wearing them as there is some discomfort but I have changed to a smaller size tip, hoping that helps.  They also match my phone case which is silly but rad.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,These stay in my ears. I have trouble with other ear buds. These stay in place and I can walk outside and not have to worry about them popping out. I had another pair that I lost one in the snow and it took an hour for me to find it walking outside. These are much better. Get them if you use earbuds you won't be disappointed.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"These are great earphones for the $25 price point.  They came with almost a full case charge and after a few days of using them for my gym time, the case still has 80-some percent charge remaining.  They are very comfortable, fit my ears well and stay in place.  The controls for track forward/back work great.  Haven't tried the mics yet as I really only wear these for workouts in the gym.  The reason I didn't give 5 stars was that they are thin-sounding at times.  I'm not sure if they don't fit my ears properly or what, but if I wanted to hear bass I'd really be missing out.  I tried the smaller pair of included earbud covers, but I don't see a difference.  It's not a big deal to me as my favs aren't about that bass, but it's something you may want to consider if you want that bottom end of the sound spectrum.  The next big test will be to see how long they actually last from full charge to battery depletion.  I need a full 8 hours and am hoping these make it.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"First try using these style of ear buds. I've just them for several weeks now. They fit mostly securely over and in the ear. I've used them both for my cell and my laptop. The sound is good enough that I've even had to take them out of my ears to be sure that the sound wasn't coming from my laptop speakers. Very nice on the surround sound, obviously. They charge fairly quickly and are easy to carry around between classes. The one 'bad' thing is that, after about 8 or so hours, the left starts dying. The right lasts for about an hour more.I've actually ordered another pair for wife, and I'm getting a third set so I don't have to switch between phone and laptop.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"The only thing I have a problem with is that they don't go into my ear well. The over-the-ear support is fine, but they don't stay in my ear well. Because of that I don't hear much bass. If I hold them in with my hands it sounds much better, but of course I can't do that al the time!Everything else is very nice. It pairs with my devices just fine. Charging each earbud while they're in their case is nice and the fact that you can recharge the earbuds from the case battery is great.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I'm a base person. I was skeptical about these earbuds but they got great reviews for sound quality.  Oh my word!  The depth of the base and sound are amazing. And they are so close to being noise cancelling, it's great if you want to shut out noise around you. Sorry I'm not sure how they would be on a plane.A couple other things I want to mention.... They paired flawlessly to my Pixel 8, and came fully charged. Instructions were simple but effective. I only wish it was possible to change the volume separately for each bud, but it's not a big deal.For the price, I'm totally satisfied!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"WOW,Iam so impressed with how nice these ear buds are!!! The price is wonderful, the quality of them is impeccableI Paisley $200 @ A.T.&T. for ear buds that kept falling out of my ears and permanently lost one plus the A.T.& T. BUDS do not hold a charge anywhere near the length of time these new buds do..Paired easily ,there are no instructions, I had to go on you tube ,but they were easy to pair to Bluetooth..They do not come with any cords.they are lightweight..I purchased the black color...",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I've been impressed with these. Sound quality is okay, nothing great. I got these on a lightning deal and figured I could use them for when I'm sweaty and working for long periods of time.I'm able to take calls/meetings with them just fine. They were inexpensive, but have lasted longer than the nicer pairs I've purchased. These are my workhorse earbuds and I can use them all day. I only have to charge the case maybe 1 time a week, and that's with heavy usage.This was definitely a diamond in the rough. Would buy again if I ever need to.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Great headphones for the price.  Decent sound and clarity on phone calls.  My only complaint if that is that they do not last 15 hours on a charge it really is closer to 12 hours, but that still is a solid time to wear them.  I use them everyday and usually put in at least 1w so they are good for my application.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"The case and led screens are great.  The sound is hollow and not that good though.  If you are looking for something to listen while you are working out, it gets the job done.  But if using this to enjoy the music, these might disappoint.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,I was impressed with the sound quality as well as the noise canceling. I needed these wireless ear phones for exercising and so far they've great. I also like the fact that I can take the case and ear phones for the weekend and they have 75hrs of play time! The charging port of the case is USB-C so my existing cables will work with it. Great value!,5
B0CSXV3GK4,I love these earbuds. Not only are they attractive they are very comfortable. I have on several ications forgot they were in my ears. The case charges quickly ( may have sonething to do with my cord) and hold the charge for a very long time. When they are in the case the case charges them. I highly recomend them. And yes the sound is amazing.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I was looking for open fit but this is not it I read it wrong ALL GOOD.The issue is it is very low, but I do like that I don't have to place the earbuds fully into my ear, so considering the comfort and the price point I will keep them.There good for very active movement.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I literally just opened the box 10 minutes ago. The package arrived a whole day earlier and Yes! I am ecstatic about that, especially with the economic struggles going on. The sound....is crisp and smooth, sounds like I am listening to an orchestra, LIVE!  I love it. True story: My daughter purchased me Beats Ear Plugs for Christmas, I'm selling them today!",5
B0CSXV3GK4,I bought over the ear headphones and they sound great but they don't fit over my bicycle helmet. So I bought these and they're very light on the bass sounds but that's okay I can wear my helmet with them.,4
B0CSXV3GK4,"The overall fit is better than I've had with most other styles similar to these ones. The sound is good and the case is great. Battery life seems good so far. Love the colour.My one gripe is that the round piece between the squishy ear insert and the battery is thicker than most other models so it pretty much instantly hurts the ears as it presses into the outer cartilage, which is disappointing.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I like these earbuds a lot.  The price was great.  Pairing them with my devices was easy. They had lots of colors to choose from.  The sound quality is excellent! I like that they stay in my ears, and I know longer worry about them falling out.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,"First, these are brand new. These earbuds sound Ok to me, fit/feel is pretty good (everybody's built different), and like I said they are brand new today, so I don't know about the charge/work time yet.The Problem i have is the documentation on how they work really sucks for me, the only thing I have is the information on this add on Amazon -- still don't know how to turn them off, if they auto off, etc..Time will tell how long they last, but they are less than $30.00.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"Fantastic price for what you get !! I have used my pair several times and love them. Easy charging, super long battery life and dock hold charge forever. Sound quality is good and does block out surrounding noise well enough.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,These earphones are AMAZING!! I bought them 3 weeks ago and have not had to charge them once since. They feel comfortable in my ear unlike AirPods whose charges only last a half of a day and fall out of your ear constantly! This was the best purchase!!!,5
B0CSXV3GK4,Best headphones I've ever had things are amazing they sit on your ear perfectly they're easy to slide on and off the rubber gripping stuff all around it makes it real easy for them to stay on and stay there and I don't fall off and you don't feel like you got a big clumpy thing on your ear but you know it's there and the sound on them is amazing and they last for freaking ever in the charge I've used them for days and days and never gotten lower than 82% charge.. in not kidding you super nice,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely likes them. They fit her ears the way she likes, the color of them is great and the sound is of good quality plus it was easy to connect with her phone. These are a great buy.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"These Wireless Earbuds with 75hrs of playtime and Bluetooth 5.3 are the best I've ever owned.  The battery life is truly outstanding, far surpassing any other earbuds I've tried.  While the price is reasonable, the long-lasting charge and overall performance make them an excellent value.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,I like that the charge last. I was looking for something that didn't go inside ear so much but for a great sound you have to secure it inside your ear.,4
B0CSXV3GK4,"Light weight and comfortable to wear foe long periods of time. I have small ears and most will hurt. These do not. Good sound quality and the price is a plus. A lot more comfortable than my beats, they hurt after a while.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I've tried lot's of these headphones dude, these are ridiculously good for the price. I use these foor travel for work on my bike but volume control should be good anywhere as most people I imagine like listening to a constant level. Plus the left earbud and right earbuds are in the correct positions in the case so you don't have to cross cross putting the earbuds in.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,I was pleasantly surprised how clear these sound for the price.  The battery lasts a long time too. They fit well and  the charging case is very nice.  I am planning on getting another pair for my brother.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,It's a little bit larger than my eat though it's perfect for my husband.  This earbuds has best sound quality and overall I think I like it.,4
B0CSXV3GK4,These are PERFECT!! The design and volume control are amazing! NO cords!!! Fast charging!!! I work as a housekeeper (8 hours a day) and I have absolutely NO problem with these staying where the should! Even sweat doesn't bother them!!,5
B0CSXV3GK4,My daughter loved the earbuds.  She is blind & needed the ear pieces on the buds. She said they are the best ones she has ever had.,4
B0CSXV3GK4,The item the head phones sit in is a bit bulky for my taste but their good for phone calls while I'm at the house I guess,4
B0CSXV3GK4,"FANTASTIC!The ONLY time I will EVER buy another earbud, is to order ANOTHER of this one just in a different color.  Soft to wear extended hours.  Fits well on my ear.  Will NEVER regret buying these.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,Awesome. I have many headphones from $30 to over $100.  This one is right up there with the best ones.  I will get another for the truck and while ridge running in my UTV as I lose them easy.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"The quality is pretty good, just the volume keeps lowering on its own. After about 20 seconds it raises back up on its own.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,I love these headphones. I hate the apple ones and after awhile earbuds start hurting my ears. I got these and had them in for hours. The quality is great as well. So happy with my purchase.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Great battery life, great sound quality, but I was extremely surprised at how comfortable they are. I don't particularly care for the over the ear design on earbuds, but I hardly notice these when I'm wearing them.",5
B0CSXV3GK4,I lose ear buds and didn't want to spend a lot. They can't be beat for the price and sound was better than I was expecting. Probably have to buy them again when I lose one lol.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"For the price these bad boys deliver.  They stay on ear good, the case is cool and it makes a click sound when you close it which makes me feel in control sound is okay",4
B0CSXV3GK4,"I am not crazy about ear buds that fit into the ear, for what these are, the comfort is acceptable. What I really like about them is that they are very easy to pair, even with a 4-year-old Galaxy. The sound quality is very good. I do wish they had an independent volume control. For the money, I don't these can be beat.",4
B0CSXV3GK4,They do what they say and great for taking hands free calls my girlfriend thought I was just on the phone normally with how good she could hear me so for 24 bucks I'd recommend them,5
B0CSXV3GK4,These ear buds are great. The sound quality for music is very good. Phone call quality is really good too. Very convenient to get multiple charges from the case before having to recharge. Very comfortable too.,5
B0CSXV3GK4,I love my ear buds. They fit well do not hurt my ears long wear noise cancel good distance works good quality sound love the color  they work great. I bought another for a gift for a friend,5
B0CSXV3GK4,"Very impressive product. Price, sound quality, fits well over the and battery longevity is great. Would definitely purchase this again.",4

B0BT8K88SR,"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up this cup. It was a Hugh mug!I got it for my teenage Grandson for Christmas because he is out for several sports in school. This jug promises to keep the liquid cold for 12 hrs, which I'm sure he will appreciate it on the field at practice! Teenage boys are So hard to buy for, but I know his favorite color is blue and he loves anything with the Under Armour logo on it! It seemed to be heavy duty and of good quality. Score, for Grandma!",5
B0BT8K88SR,"The size is perfect and the color as well.. I only had an issue with the hanging attachment, it was not functional for me, other than that I love the size and color",5
B0BT8K88SR,"All good so far, build quality feels good and no leaks at all, ended up ordering the straw that's made for it since my only complaint is no straw.Lock feature works OK no big issue and ice is still in container after longer than 12 hours.The weight is fine even when full",5
B0BT8K88SR,I drink water in this for work and it is sturdy!!!! It keeps my drink cold and that's without ice. I've had ice in it before and it stayed cold for a full 24hr! This is for sure a winner for me!!!! I washed it in the dishwasher and it cleaned very well,5
B0BT8K88SR,"This jug is well insulated (almost as good as the metal, vacuum formed type), has an easy to use spout lid, and is very affordable.  I have no need for the hanging handle on the lid, and it actually gets in the way sometimes, but I can see where it would be very handy at sports practice to hang on the fence, dugout barriers, etc.  I would buy again.",5
B0BT8K88SR,Great!! Handles are convenient and stays cold! Holds so much,5
B0BT8K88SR,"Bought for my boyfriend who works construction, keeps water ice cold all day and love the extra large capacity!",5
B0BT8K88SR,"We got these for our kids' softball team, and they're perfect. They hold a lot of water, and the kids love the colors.",5
B0BT8K88SR,"Se me ha caido mas de una ocacion, es muy resistente.",5
B0BT8K88SR,"Not a fan of the fence hooks on it, but other than that, works fine.",4
B0BT8K88SR,"Pro tip for these jugs, always add more ice than water on hot days to ensure your ice doesn't melt. It can't definitely stay cold/frozen for a whole day, just have to get the ratio right!!I got the purple and pink one at Marshalls and everyone on the volleyball team loves it, so I got these two as a white elephant gift for our team party. can't wait to see how excited everyone gets! Or if others had the same idea lol!STAY HYDRATED YALL!",5
B0BT8K88SR,Had this for around 3 years and is amazing,4
B0BT8K88SR,"I've had this bottle for over a month now and all I can say is this is a very solid, and affordable product. Great buy!",5
B0BT8K88SR,It was what I ordered  and came fast and works perfectly for  what I wanted it for,5
B0BT8K88SR,Es grande,4
B0BT8K88SR,"I wish it kept ice longer, but other than that it was as expected. Good product.",4
B0BT8K88SR,"Es realmente grande, bueno para el trabajo o gimnasio",5
B0BT8K88SR,Same,4
B0BT8K88SR,"This water bottle is bigger than I envisioned, but it will still work well as a gift.",5
B0BT8K88SR,Loved the handle and no leaks,4
B0BT8K88SR,"LIKES: holds 64oz of liquids - NOT SO ENAMORED WITH: Doesn't keep liquds cold as long as advertised  |  Handle is bendable (which the description mentioned) but for the weight, I think it would be better if it were rigid  |  Had to purchase the straw separately for $10 bucks  |  Drinking spout only screws to one side. It would be great if the starting screw point would end up in a different spot (I know, I'm being picky, but I want to be fully informative here).  OTHER: I don't DO sports events, so the fact that it hangs on a chain link fence means nothing to me. ;-)  EDIT: I've decided to return it. I'm replacing it with a stainless steel jug because it's been my experience that they keep the ice/liquid cold longer. Also I hate the straw and that handle issue. Obviously, I'm not lovin' this jug.",4
B0BT8K88SR,"Muy bueno , maravilloso",5
B0BT8K88SR,Excelente botella para llevar al gym y a cualquier lugar es de 2lts,5
B0BT8K88SR,Simply beautiful,5
B0BT8K88SR,I like how big it is,5
B0BT8K88SR,Does a great job of keeping ice from melting and my drink cold for like 24 hours. I love the Baltimore Orioles color too. Would definitely recommend.,5
B0BT8K88SR,"Very large, sturdy, and dependable. Great for sports on a hot day! The handle on the side is flexible and that makes it easier to squeeze this large bottle into tight spaces.",5
B0BT8K88SR,Very sturdy and leak proof.,5
B0BT8K88SR,Got this for my son's football season. Not only did it keep the water from getting too warm but it never got a mildew smell and held up to being tossed around with his equipment all season. Would buy again!,5
B0BT8K88SR,This is the perfect sized water jug for me at work. I usually drink the full one right as my shift is ending easily portable and easy to drink from. Keeps the water fresh and cold,5
B0BT8K88SR,"I'm seriously confused why so many people are saying this keeps their drinks cold.  I bought two of these for my wife and I, and fill half of it up with ice.  You can feel the cold at the bottom almost immediately, which is a bad sign.  The ice melts in no time, and before night hits the water is not ice cold anymore.  I like the design of it, the large opening for putting ice in, the grip and handle, etc., but if it's not going to keep the water cold, what's the point?",3
B0BT8K88SR,I purchased this for my son for when he goes to his boxing training and he likes it very much. He says he likes how it keeps the ice good for several hours. He also fills it up with ice and water before he goes to sleep and drinks from it if he wakes up in the middle of the night.,5
B0BT8K88SR,Kids like the Dual handle and color choices but had the lid break once already. was able to get a replacement but for everyday use not sure this will last a full season,4
B0BT8K88SR,"Doesn't keep beverages cold that long and the button to open the lid works 20% of the time, but given the price and capacity i'd buy it again",4
B0BT8K88SR,"I've got two kids under 10 in my house, I try really hard to make sure they stay hydrated and drink water. They're pretty good about it, and will mostly choose water to drink over milk/tea/cokes for almost every meal. That being said, they've started drinking it more often out of their ""jugs"" as we call them. I got them both a 32 oz, and myself a 64 oz. They go to their ball games, practices, and are almost always on the table. I always hand wash them because their size makes it easy so I cant comment of dishwasher safe reliability but the top is listed as safe for dishwasher use.",5
B0BT8K88SR,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I have read that it is healthy to drink 2 oz per pound of body weight and I weigh almost 260 which means I would have to drink three of these per day. I take this water bottle with me to work and it is easy to complete that task I recommend you trying this product out.,5
B0BT8K88SR,"This is nice, my son uses it for baseball practice/games, but the first one we bought had the rubber seal stretch and break, and the second one is better, but to twist it properly closed, it is so hard to do that my 8 year old can't do it. The latch for the spout can kinda wear out, then you have to push the button and pull the cap to open.",4
B0BT8K88SR,I love the color of this water bottle and the price. I needed a larger water bottle for sports but did not want to spend a lot of money. I will say it does not seem to keep ice/water as cold for as long as more expensive water bottles but it works long enough to get me through a sporting event. I am not sure that I like the handle that you can hang on the fence. May be a good option for some but seems to make it more bulky.,4
B0BT8K88SR,Seals well. The pour cap sometimes get stuck due to the vacuum of the water in the bottle. So you need to flip it open once to break the seal then the button will work. Other than that it works great.,4
B0BT8K88SR,"My household loves this water bottle so much that we have multiples in different colors. I love the neon color options. This is a heavy duty water bottle, surely holds a gallon of hydration, with a cool popping lock to secure the water lid. Can be handled with one hand, though it is pretty large and can be unwieldy.  The handle really only allows for right hand use. This jug has been dropped and rolled around in a vehicle, have never had issues with leaking. Keeps ice water cold for a long time. I like that it has hooks which I use to hang the bottle from the center console of my vehicle. I also attach my gym keys to the water bottle. Has been put through dishwasher several times. I use it so much, could probably stand to wash it more often, haha.",5
B0BT8K88SR,Me agrado bastante muy bueno este producto,5
B0BT8K88SR,hated the top and weird handle thing - ended up giving it away.,3
B0BT8K88SR,My son works construction  and this water bottle was run over twice yesterday by one of the large machines. Definitely is CAT approved!!,5
B0BT8K88SR,I consume a gallon of water every day. This size is good for work use. I have no brand preference.,5
B0BT8K88SR,I loved the handle to carry that amount of water. What I didn't like is that it doesn't keep the cold for that long! Product overall is okay...,3
B0BT8K88SR,"My fiance works construction.  I thought this product would be cool for him,  but it's just gotten ridiculous how much he loved it.  He named it ""Juggy"" and all the crew jealous.  It hangs on the equipment nicely and keeps it cold all day.  I'd recommend to anyone!",5
B0BT8K88SR,"Surprisingly light and easy to carry around, keeps the water cold/cool well into the next day.",5
B0BT8K88SR,The media could not be loaded.,5
B0BT8K88SR,"Good size have had and used it if needed for a year, it does leak.",3
B0BT8K88SR,"I like the bottle overall. It keeps liquids cool for 8 to 12 hours. The soft side handle is convenient.  Good leverage for unscrewing  the top.The seal on the lid doesn't  leak. The only downside is that the quick release for the spout cover releases only about 30% of the time. It worked well for about the 1st week, so I'm not sure what has caused the degraded function. I can still flip the cover up, it just takes a thumb and finger or a finger nail to get some leverage.",4
B0BT8K88SR,"We don't like the stationary fence hooks as these are being used for marching band, but otherwise really great quality.",4
B0BT8K88SR,"Our son is hard in everything, but these have stayed around for a few seasons.  We will buy more when we need to",5
B0BT8K88SR,It is really nice and good for what you pay. But the handle is a little bit uncomfortable. Also ice melts pretty fast but stays cool for awhile. But good size nonetheless and nice for sports or just to stay hydrated.,4
B0BT8K88SR,"This water jug is a little bulky to carry around, it holds as much water as I like to drink at work a day and has the hooks on the handle so I can hand it out of the way on the side of my desk cubicle.",4
B0BT8K88SR,I got 2 of these for my kids for their sports and they're perfect! Keeps their water cold and has held up excellently for the season!,5
B0BT8K88SR,My 10 year old loves this water bottle for all of his sporting events. Holds lots of water and is very easy to carry!,5
B0BT8K88SR,"This is good to have if you are on the go and need to hydrate.  Just one note, becuase this isn't steel, even ice well melt fast in hot temperatures.",4
B0BT8K88SR,"Overall, a very sturdy container that keeps fluid cold for a long time. Lots of Pros, there are some cons (mostly, the plastic lid) :-the lid breaks easily if dropped-the lid spring wears out after about 6 months-not as easy to clean as statedAgain, very good overall. I just bought my 4th in 3 years (all because of broken/worn lids, but I keep buying it because it is still worth the price).",4
B0BT8K88SR,Great for a construction site. Heavy duty and no leaking. Watch when you flip that lid open. It is a heavy duty spring too and it could really hurt if your finger is in the way.,5
B0BT8K88SR,Perfect for the athlete. Allows for hanging on fences or ball bags with attached hooks. Fits approximately two 16 oz water bottles. The water remains cold for a 2 hour practice but not much after that! No leakage with use at this time,5
B0BT8K88SR,"Works Great, the button was stuck at first but worked once used a few times",5
B0BT8K88SR,My son was wanting a bigger water jug for football and this works great! It's holding up good and looks cool too!,5
B0BT8K88SR,"The description says it's insulated, but ice has melted pretty fast. Overall it's a great bottle though, I just expected it to keep drinks cold for longer than an hour.",3
B0BT8K88SR,"Perfect for anyone who plays sports. Stays cold, handles great and sturdy. The fence hooks on the lid make it great for keeping it off the ground.",5
B0BT8K88SR,"I got this for my teen son. It's perfect so far (no leaks!). It has hooks that hang on the fence, which is great. It also has a pour spout, which he likes.",5
B0BT8K88SR,"They fixed almost everything from the older one. The teardrop opening lets air in and eliminates a lot of the glug when drinking. It's easier to hold one handed with both the grip and the side handle. The flip top is harder to accidentally open. Overall, this is as perfect of a water bottle as I've used.A few negatives that could & should be improved:*The rubber gasket seal in the lid shifts a little every time the lid is removed & put back on. It comes out completely after maybe a dozen times at most. It may be closer to 6 times. It's not obvious when it comes out until water spills everywhere.*The small metal bar that holds the handle and the flip top lid in place comes out over time. I keep having to remember to push them back in or else they'll come off. I usually use a key or something to push them back in. It's too difficult and painful to push them in with my fingers.",4
B0BT8K88SR,I love this jug so much. Keeps ice frozen for about 4 to  6hours until all ice melts. Keeps the liquid cold for about 9hrs then you will notice a huge difference of it warming back up,5
B0BT8K88SR,Es magnifico,5
B08DLXZKF7,Works great and does the job I get a good workout with these and everyday I find new uses and ways to use these in my workouts and their great for a cheap starter but I feel the more expensive ones will last longer and are stronger these feel thin and cheap and I'm afraid to stretch too much and too far I had one snap on me doing what's and it hurt I feel their more for a smaller person and I'm kinda in the middle of small and big. But anyways I recommend these if your on a budget and need something for working out and your small and petite.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"This set of bands is nice.  They come in a little bag and are labeled as to what resistance they are. I personally find that the most resistive of them isn't enough for a lot of my workouts. So I double up on them. Its not a big deal, but if you're looking for serious resistance bands for training, maybe look at some other options before these so you don't have to use multiple loops at once. Also they are a little slippery so if you're wearing leggings they tend to slide down a bit.",4
B08DLXZKF7,Perfect assortment and good value!,5
B08DLXZKF7,These resistance loops are a great addition to your home workout equipment. Great variety of resistance and comes with a guide to use on your own if not following a workout program,5
B08DLXZKF7,"I took the strongest one out of the bag, the black one and put it below my knees to try to work my eye doctors. It's definitely not strong enough. Didn't even attempt looking at the weaker ones because even the strongest one isn't strong. Returning for a better brand such as skills. No longer buying these trying to made crap",3
B08DLXZKF7,Variety of sizes and different workouts to do. They work great.,5
B08DLXZKF7,I liked that they were packaged in a net bag which makes it easier to keep them together. Quality was very good.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Great but wish there was more of the strongest type,4
B08DLXZKF7,"I'm a 63-yr old who'd been suffering with shoulder pain since late summer. To perform self-therapy, I needed to purchase some resistance bands. These Renoj bands are perfect for the task. After just 4 days I feel I'm on the mend. I started with the least resistance as to develop correct movement thru the repetition. I will graduate to more tension to advance my therapy.",5
B08DLXZKF7,Great purchase. Started using them this week so far so good,5
B08DLXZKF7,The company asked how we were enjoying our resistance bands. As it happens one had a small tear after working out with them. I let them know and they sent me the whole set at no expense to me. They are great when at home watching tv and strengthening my shoulders! Thank you!,5
B08DLXZKF7,"Excelente, muy buena calidad",5
B08DLXZKF7,Perfect for my exercise journey,5
B08DLXZKF7,The bands are all marked and color coded with the type of resistance. And it comes with a useful carrying mesh bag.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Very Satisfied!,5
B08DLXZKF7,They were terrific. Just what the patient needed.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"it's a great selection but, they're shorter than I expected. so far, I haven't had one break. so many simple exercises can be done with a set like this.",4
B08DLXZKF7,Very good quality!,5
B08DLXZKF7,It does what it should be,5
B08DLXZKF7,It was just like I use on the gym.,5
B08DLXZKF7,I thought these bands  (5) were a good price for the number of bands.They work great.  I've used them eith a vlass and wither clients I train.,5
B08DLXZKF7,keeps your excercice routine constant while traveling,4
B08DLXZKF7,I bought them for my wife as replacements for existing resistance bands and she says they provide more resistance than the old bands.,4
B08DLXZKF7,Good,5
B08DLXZKF7,Definitely can't go wrong for the money! Nicely made,5
B08DLXZKF7,Love it,5
B08DLXZKF7,"These bands are proving to be well made and strong. Plus, the seller reached out after I received the item to check in on how I liked them.",5
B08DLXZKF7,After 8 months of PT this is a great product for my home maintence.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"perfect resistance bands, work well for our needs.  Same quality as at the PT place.",5
B08DLXZKF7,Excellent product!  I love that there are so many different resistances and that each band is labeled showing its resistance.  Bands I have had in the past were not labeled.  I can't speak to the longevity of these bands but if they hold up they will be all-around perfect.,5
B08DLXZKF7,I like that you get enough bands for different levels. They work great,5
B08DLXZKF7,They do what they are meant to do,5
B08DLXZKF7,Came with a nice mesh pouch for storage.  Comes with pictures showing several exercises.  Bands range from light to extra heavy.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Great quality and price. Different levels of resistance give me the choice of which to do on whatever part of the body I'm working on.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Item just as described,5
B08DLXZKF7,I am using these bands to strengthen my legs. The assorted resistance gives you many different options to go with. Good product!,5
B08DLXZKF7,good,4
B08DLXZKF7,The quality of these bands are great! They are comfortable and easy to use. The different colors and them being labeled is very helpful.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"Perfect addition to my home gym, perfect sizes& resistance. .",5
B08DLXZKF7,Five levels of bands for one low price. Works great.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Bands work!!,5
B08DLXZKF7,these bands are perfect for a home workout. Resistance bands allow you to do a variety of exercises and work many different muscle groups. They also allow you and your spouse to work out at varying levels because the bands have different sizes. We love this purchase.,5
B08DLXZKF7,good,5
B08DLXZKF7,It has helped me a lot build muscle in my butt and I love them so much. Life saver and I don't need to go to the gym.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Se sienten muy bien por el momento,5
B08DLXZKF7,Feliz y agradecida buen producto lo recomiendo,5
B08DLXZKF7,"These are great ...AND ONCE I FIGURED OUT WHAT RESISTANCES WORKED FOR ME, I made others happy, giving them away...the lowest resistance ones were great for my GF's elderly parents and they got into using them...good for them and I got some brownie points/gratitude from my GF.  : ))",5
B08DLXZKF7,I like the product. Very inexpensive,5
B08DLXZKF7,"Very good resistance, strong, and definitely slip resistant. Been using for only a few days and can see results already.",5
B08DLXZKF7,Exactly as described! Very durable so far.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"This was a pre Christmas gift for my 6'4"" footballer son to train in the gym and on the field. He loves the bands and told me that it has been one of the best gifts he has received!",5
B08DLXZKF7,High quality bands. Multiple resistance options. Fun colors. Great value.,5
B08DLXZKF7,A well made product,5
B08DLXZKF7,"Quality is pretty good, so far using them to help me do more pushups and leg workouts. Really glad I got them",5
B08DLXZKF7,Works for what I wanted. Like the difference weights,5
B08DLXZKF7,Color coding of bands works well.,4
B08DLXZKF7,"Nothing particularly special about these bands except they work, and they represent a good value!",5
B08DLXZKF7,Very pleased with these bands. Working great for my 2025 resolution!,5
B08DLXZKF7,They work well and arrive early. A good purchase.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Will purchase again.,5
B08DLXZKF7,A good variety and long lasting.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Prompt fulfillment and product as advertised.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Good product,5
B08DLXZKF7,They have perfect increments of tension from extra heavy to extra light.  I like them better than free weights.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Was satisfied on this product. Had a nice case and a variety of sizes and width would buy it again.,4
B08DLXZKF7,I'm usually skeptical about the quality of resistance bands but these have been great so far. I also love that estimated lbs are included. Great quality for the price!,5
B08DLXZKF7,Perfect for at home gyms. Nice gradual resistance,5
B08DLXZKF7,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These look really strong and reliable. Even coming with storage net bag so we don't lose the bands.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"I found that all these bands are rather light-weight resistance.  Probably good for beginners, but I had hoped for more.",3
B08DLXZKF7,"The resistance band that I was given for PT after knee surgery finally broke and I went online for a replacement. Decided on these because the reviews were good and the price was right. And, get multiple bands in different colors designated by the amount of resistance. They are great. I brought the lightest resistance band (green) to the office and use it in the morning. I have one in my bedroom, one in the living room. Definitely feel the difference in the bands. Also like that they came with some suggested exercises, since I've tended to do the same with my old one. Nice to mix things up. Not 100% sure why they came with a little mesh bag, but I guess a bonus.",5
B08DLXZKF7,"Very comfortable,  great quality",5
B08DLXZKF7,Works great.,5
B08DLXZKF7,"Colors are according to your resistance, great quality",5
B08DLXZKF7,Using these for increasing the difficulty of basic stretches and so far I love them.,5
B08DLXZKF7,Bands are not marked for resistance.,4
B08DLXZKF7,Good quality,4
B08DLXZKF7,When I first opened these I could tell right away they were a much higher quality compared to the ones I had bought the week before.Those had such a terrible chemical smell that I had to leave them outside for 5 days and they still smelled toxic! When I tried the first band it immediately snapped and broke! I was shocked! I'm 75 years old and this was lightest one! I was actually happy that I could then return them.These bands are very smooth and have zero smell!!! They haven't snapped and broken yet. These were only $1.50 more than the first ones I bought. I would recommend these!,5
B08DLXZKF7,Wasn't what I was looking for and it didn't say the size of it in the listing. They really should specify that it is a mini sized band since I didn't even know that resistance bands came in different sizes. Either way it's too cheap to warrant a return so I will just look up some mini resistance band workouts to make use of them.,3
B08DLXZKF7,Be careful not to overdo. They look so simple but muscle pain will occur if you do too much on the first day.,5
B08DLXZKF7,They are great,4

B01E4LWBLQ,"Bought this for my mom and I to do on a girls weekend trip. We live far away but are best friends! Several things went wrong but alas, it turned out beautifully!!!!Some tips: use extra drop cloths for your work stations; watch the video; shorthand the directions so you aren't overwhelmed; use all disposable wisks and bowls; don't be afraid to really get into the crevices and clean it up; have fun!We read the directions three times each, watched the video, and also wrote down our own shorthand directions. We didn't have an extra person to help us, so having the short hand directions with us was helpful so we didn't have to keep watching the video or reading the directions. It really isn't difficult; the directions are just extremely thorough which can seem intimidating!We were staying at an Airbnb so we used distilled water which we kept in the fridge until we were ready.We had the idea of holding a heart-shaped stone together, but ended up deciding the stone was too small to be visible in the final sculpture. So we decided to put the heart shaped stone in the actual plaster as we poured. We waited until the mold was filled about 2/3 with plaster and made sure it was startkng to firm before adding the crystal. We didn't want it sinking to the bottom!Several things went wrong in the process, all preventable, all user error. We laid down extra plastic dollar store tablecloths to protect the ground. Boy, are we lucky we did that! While swirling the plaster around in our mold, I accidentally let the mold slide right out of the bucket!!!!!! The directions literally warns you this can happen, hahaha. HOWEVER!! Thankfully, after bouncing three feet along the ground, the mold was perfectly fine!!!!!But then! As I diligently poured the plaster, my foot accidentally kicked over the bucket containing our wet plaster! Thankfully we were able to salvage it by picking up the tarp it spilled on, and pouring it back into the bucket.Once the plaster was set and ready to be cleaned up, there were quite a few air bubbles. I'm sure this is also avoidable, but I really enjoyed deep cleaning the sculpture and making it perfect. I also had a bit longer nails that didn't cast well. I didn't think it would be an issue, but apparently it was, haha. My rings casted beautifully though and although I would've loved for my mom to wear her wedding rings, she was worried about them not casting well.We made some mistakes along the way, but overall enjoyed the process and I would definitely do this again!!!!! Plus, one day if the sculpture were to break, we'll still have the heart shaped crystal that's inside.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,It's incredible. We bought this for a close relative to do with her father who will be going to his heavenly home soon. She will ALWAYS hold her daddy's hand with this mold. The process was easy and explained well on the directions. The mold turned out perfect and had every detail of their hands.,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"I'll try to post a photo later.  We used it for a hand-holding statue of my parents and displayed it at their 50th-wedding-anniversary party.  It turned out fantastic - even though I had to fix a lot of tiny bubbles due to not following instructions carefully enough.If I remember right, the instructions say to gently pound the bucket on the ground after you pour the silicone liquid in.  This should get the bubbles out before you stick hands in the bucket.  I poured the mixture into the bucket and turned around to finish reading the instructions.  I turned around to see my parents had already put their hands in the bucket.  So, we had a lot of tiny bubbles - both from the surface of their hands and hand hairs and also due to the liquid not having all the bubbles out.  Still, there was a ton of detail - including wrinkles in the skin and the design engraved on their wedding bands.Fortunately, I did save some of the cement powder aside, and was able to use it to fill in occasional tiny flaws.  And I used some of the tools to break off the little bubbles and smooth them over.  The cement will stay a little soft or a tiny bit damp for a few days. So, it's easy to fix any tiny flaws or bubbles.  I'm somewhat of an artist.  So, I spent about an hour on it while I talked to my little brother and got it virtually perfect.  :)  We displayed it the next day at the party as a beautifully lit center piece on a display table with their photo montage playing in the background.We packaged it up along with the finishing stuff you put on once it's fully dry, and sent it home with them - with instructions to apply the finish after 14 days.Follow the instructions - it's totally worth it.  For me, it seemed reasonably priced for what it is and what it comes with.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,"Great buy! The kit came with everything inside the bucket. Followed the directions of the video and it worked perfectly. The silicone casting can be a bit tough to remove from the bucket after it dries, so I would caution not to press too hard or hit it too much when removing it from the bucket, as it could damage the sculpture inside. You may also want to be in a comfortable position BEFORE you get started because you'll have to stay in that position til the casting firms. Other than that, enjoy with your family and have fun.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,"The goal was to send hand molds to a family member out of state who is blind.  Overall I, the kit worked pretty well.  There were some important lessons learned, however, and we would do it differently next time but wouldn't hesitate to use similar kits from this company.The kit says it can cast ""up to 6 hands"" -- which I thought meant the negative mold material could be re-used and the casting material mixed in portions to use the kit several distinct times, once for each child.  That's not how it works.  On reading the instructions I learned that we'd have to do the kids all at once.We were planning hand casts of a 4 year old, a 5 year old, a 7 year old, and a 17 year old -- with the youngest ones all very fidgety by nature.  The idea of having them all stay still with their hands in a bucket of goo for several minutes, without touching each other, the sides or bottom of the bowl did not fill me with confidence.I was pleasantly surprised by how well they came out.  The youngest did make a fist so we ended up with a bubble at one finger tip of that tiny hand.  The oldest didn't have room to get their whole hand in so we were limited for that one.The instructions say to vibrate the bucket while the cast is drying to help get bubbles out.  We set ours on the washing machine while it was in a fast spin cycle and that worked really well.The tiny finger on one hand broke during the removal of the negative material, but was very easily glued back in place with a bit of cyanoacrylate glue (crazy glue) as was the thumb on the 17 year old's hand which simply didn't have enough coverage due to the size of their hand and the size of the bucket.",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"I haven't opened it yet, so I can't review the product itself. More will be revealed. I bought a a Valentine's Day gift for my closest friends, it was the perfect choice, I was so happy to find it.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,"They simply love it. They just had their 15th anniversary and they were able to do the plastic kit and it looks amazing and it was fun to do. They thanked us so much and I want to think Amazon cute gift for couples for grandparents new babies, etc..",5
B01E4LWBLQ,It was very easy to use! We did this with my partner a week before valentine haha. The result was better than what we expected.,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Years later looks the same as when we made it. Easy to follow instructions.,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Love this so much. It's a really good activity to do with your partner. Turned out amazing!,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"Cheap, easy, durable! Good size",5
B01E4LWBLQ,What a wonderful Keepsake item to have. Very easy to do. Will treasure it always.,5
B01E4LWBLQ,AWESOME VALENTINE GIFT,5
B01E4LWBLQ,they loved it,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Great instructions and easy to use! My husband and I did this for our anniversary this past year and I am so happy to have this keepsake!,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Bought this for my kids and it turned out great. Easy to use and makes a beautiful memory,4
B01E4LWBLQ,"Since my grandkids are homeschooled I thought it would be a wonderful gift to support my daughter with all the hard work she does all year. I bought the family size so we could fit 3 kiddos hands inside. They are 8-11 & 13. To insert their hands we needed to prep them so they wouldn't be so complaining-""Don't touch me"" ""You're too close"" LOLOL!! We were staying with the kids while their parents were on a work trip for my SIL. Perfect timing!Here's our experience: the reviews were so valuable here!  *We weren't sure how messy it was so we set down a tarp & worked from the floor. That proved to be a great plan bc the floor was easier to get to to insert the kids hands so they wouldn't be arguing! For the mixing, we did use a mixing tool for household projects-like a mixer with a drill attached. Did not have access to a baking mixer and if I did, not sure I'd risk wrecking it. It stirred up great and I followed the instructions regarding timing from when it starts to turn pink. I'd say it's better to be safe and position your hands when it is light pink and be prepared to stay there for about 8-10 minutes.*Once it tacky to the touch we could see that it had gelled up and releasing the hands was quite easy! I'd make a suggestion that when deciding on your hand placement I would choose placing them in a touch pose. Our pose had small gaps (remember we were trying to keep the kids agreeable! LOL) as I was trying to accomplish 3 hands positioned to hold a pencil! It did work but the gaps had me going a bit ""OCD"" for getting the mold material picked out of the tiny gaps. If you don't get it out the instructions say it can collect mildew & I could see why! I'm trying to upload a photo...I hope I can do that easily!Those were our biggest takeaways that I felt were worth sharing. This is a great product and I'm considering getting one for a few wedding couples coming up.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,This product was bought for my in-laws for Christmas. We did it all together and the finished product was beautiful! Must do!,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Making memories with my 94 year old mother and husband 3 of our children. Easy. Love it,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Although the cover was extremely difficult to pry open (I had to cut it open), the end result turned out beautifully!",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"The product was good, but we ended up having to CUT the lid off because it was so hard to get off with just our hands. And we aren't weaklings. Yikes",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"Great gift idea, my grand kids loved it!",5
B01E4LWBLQ,Wonderful keepsake maker!!!,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Love it,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Instructions were very thorough but pretty long. I love how it came out! Very messy project so just be prepared to have trash bags or newspaper to cover the area. Honestly the hardest part about the whole thing was opening the damn tub.,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"We thought that we would be disappointed in the final result, but we were very impressed with how it turned out. It captured every detail of our hands. It wasn't a perfect finish, but we didn't have to do much in terms of touch ups. You've got to tap the bucket to get out air bubbles and before the mold sets you have to keep moving your hands to let it properly make contact with all parts of your skin. Additionally, it was a great bonding experience and we both loved that it drew us closer to each other. Now we have something tangible that represents our love.",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"My wife and I enjoyed doing this. Now we have a keep sake of us holding hands. She was very surprised to get this as a birthday gift from me. Easy to do, just follow the instructions.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,"I got this probably about 2 years ago for a Father's Day gift but we never got around to actually doing it... Let me tell you after doing this last night with my Boyfriend, and our 2 & 3 year old sons I wish we would have done it sooner because are absolutely amazed at how it came out. We weren't sure if our toddlers would cooperate but surprisingly it worked out well and they waited patiently while we allowed for the mold to cure. I am now considering getting a few more to cast my other kids and experiment with various objects and will make a hobby out of this. It was so much fun and when you see your masterpiece it was worth the wait! Highly recommend for capturing your precious moments and doing this yearly would be a great way to watch the growth of your little ones!! It is very fragile and the finger of my son broke off so I would recommend reserving some of the plaster to fix any imperfections.. Overall definitely happy with how it came out and can't wait to order more!",5
B01E4LWBLQ,Great for date night,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Did it with my man and we enjoyed every bit of it, experience was fun, pretty easy to do, instruction video on YouTube did well.",5

B01E4LWBLQ,Great product,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"This is hands down, full pun intended, my favorite piece of art in my home. Carefully read all the instructions before starting. Once you mix the mold material, it sets up quick! Instructions say it takes 6-10 minutes, our mold was fully set in about 3. We let the casting material set for 2.5 hours before removing the mold. Take your time and be gentle when using the pin and wooden poker. The cast material is solid after 2.5 hours, but it's still easy to scratch the surface since it hasn't fully dried. The bucket lid was hard to open, and we did use distilled water. Not much else I can say that other reviews haven't already covered. Follow the steps and you'll have a beautiful keepsake!",5
B01E4LWBLQ,They just loved it and it was so easy to do!,4
B01E4LWBLQ,Good,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"I love the idea of this,  I think it's a good way to save those memories and display it. So cute for baby hands or feet.",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"This kit is amazing. I got it for my husband and I to do for our 10-year anniversary. It is very easy to use, and it came out amazing!! Every single detail of our hands came through even our nail beds, the veins in his hands etc. It dried quickly and came apart nicely. We are waiting the 14 days to completely dry so we can paint it. Worth every cent I paid. I highly recommend this to anyone!!",5
B01E4LWBLQ,Great product,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"Be prepared!! As soon as it turns color make sure your hands are in there. We waited 30 seconds and it was too late. The product had set and we couldn't get our hands in there. Not the products fault, just be ready to put hands in instantly!!!",3
B01E4LWBLQ,"I saw an ad for this product, checked it out, read the reviews and decided to order it.  My wife and I are coming up on our 50th anniversary and I thought this would be a nice keepsake for us now and perhaps later on for our kids.The instructions that came with the kit were very detailed and we read them over several times before starting the project.  I used distilled water for both mixes as suggested.  The mold was a bit more challenging than we expected because setting the bucket on a table made it a little to high for my wife to comfortably reach inside so we placed it on a chair, inside of a box with newspaper in the bottom to catch the overflow.  However, we quickly discovered that for a couple of seventy-somethings to hold that stooped over position for two or three minutes was extremely hard on our backs and we were greatly relieved when time was up.  If we ever do another one, we'll figure out a different angle.Mixing the plaster presented another problem, but that was because I missed the line in the instructions that said to pour the powder into the water and let it be absorbed before stirring it.  As a result I ended up with a lot of large lumps that I really had to whip to get rid of (mostly).  As instructed, I was able to coat the inside of the mold with plaster and then I used a ladle to add the remainder of the plaster a little bit at a time.I allowed the casting to set for an hour or two longer than the instructions said and had no problem removing the mold from the casting once I got it started.  One issue I came across is that  we had a gap between our palms when we made the mold and it is extremely difficult getting all of the molding material out of that gap.  Four days later and we're still working on it, but the bottom line is that it won't show once it's mounted.I purchased a clear matte acrylic sealant and plan to lightly spray the piece before mounting it on the base, probably with a gummy adhesive.  By the way, I tried to purchase sealant and base at the same time I bought the kit, but the company's website showed that both were out of stock, so I bought them elsewhere.As with any craft, I'm sure that if we ever do more of these, we'll be more comfortable with the process and more familiar with what works and what doesn't.  We're enjoying this little project and I think the instructions provided are more than adequate.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,I love this product.  My husband and I  did one a few years back and this Christmas we are giving one to our son and his wife,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"I bought this casting kit as a holiday project for visiting relatives.  I thought it would be nice to create a mold of grandmother and teenaged grandson holding hands.  My expectations were that, even if it came out poorly, we'd have a lot of fun making it.  Wow, we were blown away by the results!  I've attached some photos of the process.  Here are my tips:1.  Assign one person (the one who likes to read instructions) to take on the task of making sure everyone follows the step-by-step process.  Preferably, this person is not one of the casting subjects. The instructions are accurate and very clear, but you shouldn't just try to wing it.2.  Every detail of your hands (or whatever you cast) will be immortalized, so file your nails nicely. Our subjects did not wear jewelry, but I think it would come out well and clean up pretty easily.3. We poured the extra casting material into the bucket to create a base for the sculpture.4.  Half of the fun is ""excavating"" the cast from the rubbery material.  Kids can participate in this part as long as they're gentle.If you're looking to create family memories and end up with an heirloom to show for it, I highly recommend this casting kit!",5
B01E4LWBLQ,"This does a really nice casting job and I would recommend it for that reason. But it did get stars off because getting the tub open is ridiculous! I needed a pair of pliers to get the strip off, and a heavy duty screwdriver to get the lid off after that. Took over an hour because I finally gave up on ruining my poor fingers and trying with my normal sized screwdriver and had to borrow the big screwdriver from my SIL. And I believe there's a risk of tearing the content bag if you're not careful with the screwdriver, because it's right at the top.",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"I love this soooo much. I've read a lot about this stuff, and I have wanted to do a mold of me holding my dog's paw. She's my whole world and I love doing cool stuff with her.I was a little discouraged by reviewers saying this stuff sticks to your dogs' fur.Keeping that in mind, I absolutely smothered her paw, and halfway up her leg, in dog conditioner (I'm a groomer, take it from me, do NOT use people conditioner. It can cause serious irritation)Some people said to use baby oil or coconut oil. I chose the conditioner just cause lol.My girl was very patient, but I imagine if your dog is a psycho, it'll be harder. She was also a little afraid of the plastic tablecloth it comes with, but no worry, I ditched it and just used it on the bathroom tile. The little bit that spilled was incredibly easy to clean up.After it set, I pulled my hand out, then her paw. There was only a small amount of the jelly stuff stuck to her fur, so I put her in the tub and used a flea comb and water and it came right off.A few hours later we had our amazing product, and I couldn't be more happy. Sadly I broke off her nail lol but I superglued it back on. Be careful standing the finished product up, it may be unstable and tip over.All in all, super easy to make, super easy to clean, and super awesome to look at.",5

We had a great time through out this experience. The instructions were easy to follow and equipment was easy to use! Great value for the money!,5

B01E4LWBLQ,God is for my dad for Father's Day ended up turning out really cute I would recommend it it's a fun cute thing to do with family color was cool side of school and the quality was amazing I 100% recommend the complete result was cool.,4
B01E4LWBLQ,"Have wanted to try hand casting for a long time. Purchased this with my sister's amazing gift based on the great reviews, price and upgraded size to allow us enough room to do the ""I love you"" gesture for sign language that we have used throughout 45 years of marriage to each other and our kids. Because we used the extra plaster for the base, it was more difficult to remove, but worth it. Simply used skewers to slide between the pail and hardened plaster completely around the base before tipping over, so made it a bit more difficult (so rating of 4), but really like the stable base. A butter knife might work, too. The fingernails do break off a bit, so had to rebuild with recommended patch material after removing the mold. Super impressed that the curved fingers above our palms retained as much detail as the outer skin and extended fingers. Followed the directions and did the cold water rinse after cleaning up. Set the base on bamboo spoons to elevate for air flow to dry (7-10 days). Directions specify using distilled water, but no amount. If you purchase two gallons, it is enough for completing the mold. FUN evening making this!  Will be a keepsake for our son that helped out in the future.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,"I purchased 2 of these kits for my anniversary and we love how these turned out!! We waited till our anniversary to do these and it we had a great time working together with making these and had fun. The hand casting reviews and videos I seen online did have me fearing that what happened to others could have been our fate as well, but im so happy with Luna Bean casting kit as ours turned out great! No imperfections what so ever. Most people have shown that part of there fingers (due to air bubbles) was missing. I did one bucket with tapping sides while our hands were in the mold and one without tapping and they both came out perfect. After the casting step, when we was able to remove the mold from bucket it was like magic and wonder of how our hands had been captured and turned out and it was a very special time for us and I STRONGLY recommend those who are interested in this to purchase Luna Bean casting kits. The meaning behind ours is Never Let Go, this gave us a chance while keeping our hands posed in the molding till it set, to talk about our relationship, all the good times we had over the years and what our wishes are for our future. Its a great way to deepen your bond as your ""stuck"" together for 6 minutes and able to really express your love for each other and what you each mean to the other. Say things you maybe havent said in a long period of time and really solidify your love for each other.",5
B01E4LWBLQ,More user friendly. Good volume. Value for money. More reliable. Really fast . Good to catch momoments,5
B01E4LWBLQ,Very cool gift and super easy to do. The instructions are clear and the results are awesome!,5
B01E4LWBLQ,"Great detail even before using the tools provided with this product. This was before using the chisel, sandpaper etc.",4
B01E4LWBLQ,"This is 100% a great idea for a family's, couples, anyone really as I will be buying one for myself to create a ring bracelet / jewelry holder for my vanity. I originally purchased this to create I Keepsake piece of art to Christen me and my partner in our first living quarters together away from our family and it has held up ever since. Definitely super easy to use and doesn't take a long time to cast the initial mold, I would say to add an additional day to the set drawing time as I found the product to be just a bit sticky and slightly malleable after drying. As of right now I can't remember if instructions mentioned any baking options but it didn't feel like something that would withstand that anyway.",5
B079KL4C91,I purchased a new laminator and needed laminator sheets. These laminator sheets work well and are a great value. It will take me a long time to use all of these up. I love that I can laminate from home. Super easy to use and they seem to hold up well.,5
B079KL4C91,"They're thin but Great for price! They also seal quick and easy. So far no issues, seems durable.",5
B079KL4C91,"First off, I have to say, they are a real game-changer. If you're like me and love keeping your documents in pristine condition, these sheets are a must-have. They're super easy to use and offer a crystal-clear finish that makes everything look professional. Whether it's for school projects, office documents, or even just preserving your favorite photos, these sheets handle it all with ease.Now, let's talk about compatibility. These laminating sheets work perfectly with the Scotch laminator. It's like they were made for each other! The sheets feed smoothly through the machine, and there's no bubbling or wrinkling to worry about. Just pop them in, and you're good to go. Plus, the bond is strong and durable, so you can trust that your laminated items will stand the test of time.Finally, let's touch on value. While there are tons of options out there, these sheets strike a great balance between quality and price. They might not be the cheapest on the market, but they offer features that are well worth the investment. If you're looking for laminating sheets that deliver consistent results without any hassle, these are definitely worth checking out. Trust me; your laminated creations will thank you!",5
B079KL4C91,I've ordered these for years now but this last time they were thinner and not quite as good of quality. But I am still happy about the price and will likely keep ordering them.,4
B079KL4C91,I bought this with the laminator and they work great. It is easy to use and the size/width fits perfectly in the Amazon laminator.,5
B079KL4C91,"One side has a seam so that you can line up inserted sheets perfectly.  Everything sealed up in a single pass through the laminator at 3mm setting.  They are not thick though. So do not expect a very stiff output.  They are not flimsy and do harden after cooling, but the edges are still bendable and will not return to shape unless you reheated it.",5
B079KL4C91,"This is really great and I have purchased multiple times. I use it to laminate my stickers and make them extra waterproof, laminate papers and more. It's amazing. Great price too! Will continue to purchase!",5
B079KL4C91,"These are comparable to the name brand and easy to use. They seem a little thin, but seal well make all of my projects more durable.",5
B079KL4C91,Bought to to print and laminate my son paper for teach in to learn to wring letter and number,5
B079KL4C91,"Works well, easy to use, size is as described, easy to storage.",5
B079KL4C91,These laminating sheets worked perfectly in the variety of laminators I had tried them in at my job. They work just the same as any name brand. They seal perfectly. Can't recommend enough for the price!,5
B079KL4C91,I bought them for my office and they do the job well.,5
B079KL4C91,Bought these since they were cheaper than name brand ones from the store. They work just as well.,5
B079KL4C91,"As good as Scotch, never had any issues.",5
B079KL4C91,Fits my laminater perfect,5
B079KL4C91,Nice,5
B079KL4C91,"They are laminating sheets so there isn't much to say. They are just like the name brand sheets, they do have a tad bit more length then the name brand sheets but I personally like that there is a bit of wiggle room incase of user error.",5
B079KL4C91,"I think that my laminator, along with my heavy duty glue gun, is my favorite tool to use. It's great for my kids' art (from their pre k days through now, at 19 and 21), it's a great way to save and enhance their paper art. It even makes the colors a little brighter. :)  I also use it for checklists with dry erase pens. (or use permanent markers and erase with a dry erase pen)These sheets are the only ones I have  ever purchased- they are a really nice weight and good for protecting anything worth saving.",5
B079KL4C91,Good,5
B079KL4C91,These laminating sheets are great!  I use them to laminate all kinds of things to use in my classroom.  I have used multiple boxes.  I haven't had a problem with them at all.  They seal together very well without issue.,5
B079KL4C91,"Nothing over the top with these laminate sheets. They do as expected/advertised, lol. Standard 8.5x11 paper fits just fine. No opaqueness and seals crystal clear. What else can I say?",5
B079KL4C91,I loved the quality of this product! Used it for classroom decor to ensure it stays sturdy for years!,5
B079KL4C91,I love this brand of laminating sheets. The quality is there and so is the price!,5

B079KL4C91,These laminating sheets work just as well as the name brand ones and are a FRACTION of the price!! I recommend these to any teachers forced to buy their own supplies!,5
B079KL4C91,Work great in my laminator! I purchased a laminator on Amazon for my signage for craft shows and needed laminating sheets and these were a great deal compared to what my local stores carry.,5
B079KL4C91,Perfectly easy to work with and creates quality work.,5
B079KL4C91,Needs to give more grip,4
B079KL4C91,Works as Designed,4
B079KL4C91,"The thickness , and how its one piece, huge benefit. So happy on this purchase.And I'm a Karen",5
B079KL4C91,These laminating sheet are easy to use and takes the heat very well when laminating. The price is very reasonable for 200 pieces. I am satisfied with them.,5
B079KL4C91,No complaints,5
B079KL4C91,The sheets are perfect for my classroom needs and cheaper than the name brans!,5
B079KL4C91,Best price and quality per sheet. Just hit the re-order button.,5

B079KL4C91,It's not the blurry one,5
B079KL4C91,"Great quality, easy to use, works on my machine",5
B079KL4C91,We use these for all sorts of random household use cases and these work as well as the other brands for a lot less.  Good buy!,5
B079KL4C91,Laminates amazing. The different sizes are great. Works so well. Heats up fast. I use these everyday.,5
B079KL4C91,I have ordered several times. I love the value.,5
B079KL4C91,Awesome laminating sheets.Works on all types of paper has great seal.,5
B079KL4C91,Does exactly what it needs to.,5

B079KL4C91,"This is my 3rd time buying. They are durable, easy to use, laminating seals well.",5
B079KL4C91,Right size and very easy to use.,5
B079KL4C91,I love these laminating pouches sooo much! I buy them regularly. I am a teacher and they are perfect. Giving 4 starts because of packaging. I wish the packaging was sturdier so I could store them better.But these are really good with turning papers in to dry erase pages. Very durable. Perfect for 1 standard sized paper.,4
B079KL4C91,This is nice for the price.  We use it with our home laminator.  I will buy again.,5
B079KL4C91,I have used this product for over a year.  Excellent quality. You won't receive such quality and large quantity for the price anywhere else. Don't sleep on the basics.  #AmazonBasics,5
B079KL4C91,"These are- good, average, I feel after laminated the adhesive does not stay stuck together as it should, even if we run it through the laminating machine twice.",4
B079KL4C91,Laminator sheets are great. But this was on the inside of the box. Read carefully to see why I had a good chuckle.,5
B079KL4C91,I use these laminating plastic sheets at work for work instructions used by the staff. Makes a durable instruction guide that can be bundled and passed around the shop or attached to work stations.,5
B079KL4C91,I may have ordered something different from my previous order as the weight and quality seem cheaper. They are hard to hold when laminating multiple elements per sheet. But once laminated they seem fine.,4
B079KL4C91,I used them in my laminator and they work ok.  Some of the sheets come put warped.  Just gotta be careful when inserting it into thr machine.  But for the value for how many sleeves you received in satisfied.  Easy to use and open.,4
B079KL4C91,Great price for quantity of sheets.. perfect weight for classroom projects,5
B079KL4C91,"Works well and easy to use. Size and quality is great, it heats up well.",5

B079KL4C91,These work great!,5
B079KL4C91,"I love this laminate paper, I buy it for teaching and the price is great, I laminate almost everything and never have any issues!",5
B079KL4C91,"I've used more expensive name brands that actually did not consistently produce great results, whereas these were less expensive and work great. A pack of 100 will last a long time in my office.",5
B079KL4C91,Great,5
B079KL4C91,Worked exactly how I'd hoped. I'm working on a holiday gift project for all my family members and these worked perfectly. I ran out and just ordered more today.,5
B079KL4C91,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                These are good quality shiny and thick,5
B079KL4C91,This are really nice work great,5
B079KL4C91,These work as well as any name brand and as a classroom teacher I fully endorsed them for their sturdy resilience.,5
B079KL4C91,Product is as described.,5
B079KL4C91,"These are great for the price!!! They were a little thin to start but then I realized I just needed to guide them better. Easy to figure out, they are long lasting, and they work just as well as what came with the machine! I have used them to laminate documents to birthday cupcake signs. They move throguh fast and I will buy again!",5
B079KL4C91,I have been using this laminate for the past three years and it works great every time. I like the low cost and great quality!,5
B079KL4C91,"I love using these laminating pouches for preserving student work samples, small bulletin board pieces, and student reference pages/work mats in their writing and math centers. I order these frequently for use with my personal laminator. The price, quantity, and quality are perfect for my purposes.",5
B079KL4C91,These Amazon Basics Clear Thermal Laminating Plastic Paper Laminator Sheets are great. I purchased a laminator years ago and have been purchasing these sheets for awhile. They work well and I have laminated many paper items for years. Great transaction. Jacquie,5
B079KL4C91,These pouches work extremely well for laminating instructions and posting information.,5
B079KL4C91,"I had couple of pages wrinkle in my thermal laminator. I don't know if its because of the paper or it didn't align properly. So, just make sure it is straight and aligned going into your thermal laminator. Otherwise, they get the job done for the price!",4
B079KL4C91,Will use soon. Good price,5
B079KL4C91,"Good price, but since they are a tad smaller, they do not work as well.",3
B079KL4C91,"Great price, they do the job",5
B079KL4C91,Good quality,4
B079KL4C91,"Purchased this clear thermal laminating sheets since i purchased crenova laminating machine and they worked perfectly together.Pros:*once laminated, it provides an excellent clear shiny look to item.*it is easy to manage.Cons:*if you have an item that is ""legal paper size"" you need to place between two to make it work.I do recomend this product.",5
B079KL4C91,Works exactly as expected with a basic Amazon Laminator.,5
B079KL4C91,"This review is going to be straight and simple. I bought these sheets to use with a Swingline brand laminator that I've had for twenty years. They are affordable, they work well, I don't have any issues with wrinkling, folding, or other issues. The lamination when done is crystal clear and will take a photo or document and protect it nicely. Overall, very happy with this product at this price and will order again.",5
B003A2I5T8,"I ordered this cardstock for multiple reasons and it works for all of them! I've been coloring with alcohol markers, which bleed through the thin coloring books I use, and it's thick and works great! It also works great to print high quality, thick/sturdy coloring pages. It's pretty standard cardstock but great, especially for the small price.",5
B003A2I5T8,"This is my go to paper for different Cricut crafts, making Father's Day coupon books for hubby, or just printing cute rewards tickets for the kids.  It's a beautiful and bright white, a good weight, and has a clean, polished, and professional look and feel.  I'm constantly surprised how often this paper comes in handy.  I have it on subscribe and save and keep it stocked at all times.",5
B003A2I5T8,"We used this type of cardstock at work so I decided to buy some for my home printer. It is a great thickness and performs well in my printer. Value is good and paper is sturdy. I don't have the proper tools to fold this well but even without, it folds nicely and doesn't crack or rip. My kids keep stealing some to draw on so it works well for that too.",5
B003A2I5T8,"It's just a normal white card stock, with normal thickness, smoothness and finish. The paper doesn't glow ""brightly"" or reflect, or shine. Not sure why they call it ""bright"". Get this for good card stock and good price.",5
B07D4YF3K4,"PROS:*exactly what it claims to be.*good value compared to other similar optionsCONS:*Kinda thin?  I'm not super familiar with paper weights and what the numbers mean but needed ""cardstock.""  This is fine but does seem a tad thin.  (Still, it is exactly what it claims to be.)*Can be confused with their bristol vellum...I'm not sure why, but, at the time of this review, the brand's listings for this cardstock and its bristol vellum look super similar, both with the same yellow patterned packaging. So make sure you're getting the one you want.  (I accidentally bought a second purchase of the vellum when this one was running late.)The cons were also my fault, so I'm mentioning them as an FYI so fewer people make the same mistakes.",5
B07D4YF3K4,I use this paper in my laser printer all the time.  It is a good quality paper and not too heavy of paper that it jams up my printer.  I believe the GSP weight is about 170.  My HP printer will handle paper up to 200 GSP.Good for mounting photos to!,5
B07D4YF3K4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love how affordable and high quality this paper is. 90lb and 300 sheets! It is super easy to arrive at my door step,5
B07D4YF3K4,"TIP: Shop by GSM, not LB. Pound ratings vary. I'd call this a triple-thick copy/printing paper, and it's a great price for that! It is NOT thick enough for use as a card base.CRAFTING/MAKING ENVELOPES: I use it to make personalized/seasonal envelopes. While it's thicker than copy paper, it's thin and smooth (no noticeable texture) for easy and good quality laser printing, and it folds easily. Sheets are equal sizes and cut well.Mfg wrapping did burst open, but luckily Amazon packed it in a book box so all sheets were in good condition. As suggested by another review, I did not order anything else with it.CARDS: Again, this is NOT thick enough as a card base. Look for a minimum 215-270 GSM paper. It IS perfect for printing and using as die-cut decorations/accents, mats, or inserts on a card. Because it is light weight, it will help avoid need for extra postage when making cards with layers. Embosses 2-D with embossing folders like a dream!It tolerates stamping, but not heavy/wet ink blending or swinking (look up Laurel Beard. It's a legit technique). A sharpie bleeds through this easily so I wouldn't consider any watercolors. It curls with shimmer spray, but if left alone to dry it won't crease and flattens when mounted onto a heavy card base.PRINTING: Thin enough so my laser can heat the paper for a good toner bond. I get vivid colors and patterns are crisp. I do not use inkjets for cards, but I would use care if printing with heavy saturation.",5
B07D4YF3K4,"The package came torn on both ends, but cardstock was perfectly fine. I mistakenly bought this product not understanding how thin 90lb cardstock is. It's not suitable for business cards like I had planned, but I've at least found a new purpose for it that will help me out with one of my ideas. I feel like I've wasted my money on something I didn't really need while my husband just sees it as trial and error. It's his money, I'm spending though. However, if I like how this cardstock works for my new idea, I'll likely buy again. The paper is nice. It's just thinner than I hoped.",4
B07D4YF3K4,Great price. Good quality,5
B07D4YF3K4,This bright white is perfect for printing!,5
B07D4YF3K4,I have ordered this set of cardstock several times. It's a great value and just the right thickness and brightness.,5
B07D4YF3K4,"Great quality cardstock, perfect for your projects or just heavy duty printing needs. Excellent value for money",5
B07D4YF3K4,"Ream of paper arrived with both ends ripped open. Looked like it was a returned item. Luckily, the inside paper looked OK, but makes it hard to store for teacher at school.",4
B07D4YF3K4,"It's is a better value than regular print paper. It has a better thickness allowing for less wrinkling. However, this particular thickness tends to curl on itself easily. I would recommend the thicker/heavier stock paper. Priced perfectly and it is sometimes cheaper than regular print paper. I use a laser printer and have no smearing when printing.",4
B07D4YF3K4,"I would've given this product a 5 star since it was what I was looking for, however, like most recent reviews, package was open already. Looked like someone else could've taken some out and returned it. I will keep it so because I need it but may look to other brands for better confidence that I didn't get someone else's returned package.",4
B07D4YF3K4,I was pleased with this purchase. I like the quality of the card stock and the amount of product in each package. I will buy this again when needed.,5
B07D4YF3K4,It was good for what I needed.,5
B07D4YF3K4,I'm a teacher so I bought this paper to use in my classes. I usually print things I want my kids to hang onto on card stock because it's more sturdy. This one isn't as thick as what I normally buy at michael's or hobby lobby which was a bummer. It's doing ok though.,3
B07D4YF3K4,Excellent product at great price. thank you team for awesome customer experience. very grateful.,5
B07D4YF3K4,Great addition to my classroom,5
B07D4YF3K4,good quality cardstock,5
B07D4YF3K4,"I'm a scrapbooker & use all different weights of paper. I usually scrap with 65lb cardstock. This is NOT 90lb paper. The paper is nice & prints nicely, but not as thick as advertised.",3
B07D4YF3K4,"Maybe I misunderstood the description but I thought this was going to be at least average weight cardstock. It's definitely not, it's pretty thin.If you need thinner than average cardstock then I would recommend. Otherwise, you need to look elsewhere.",3
B07D4YF3K4,Good quality paper. Like buying this product.,5
B07D4YF3K4,"I was very disappointed with the thickness, feels more like 24-65lb. I also bought a 110lb pack at the same time and that one was more between the 65-90lb. Color and smoothness of the paper is nice but the weight is way off. Thankfully, because the quality is good, I can still put it to use.",3
B07D4YF3K4,The paper I was looking for except it came with the package being all damaged on each side and opened. Surprisingly the papers were all good.,3
B07D4YF3K4,I've used this brand multiple times. It's always good quality.,5
B07D4YF3K4,Exactly what I was looking for! Cheap we than Staples and delivered  to me !,5
B07D4YF3K4,"The outer wrapper for this ream of cardstock arrived damaged/ripped. Thankfully the paper inside was fine, so I did not return. Cardstock is a great weight for art projects!",4
B07D4YF3K4,"Not as thick as I had hoped and came with a squished corner, but will do the job",4
B07D4YF3K4,Kind of flimsy. I thought 90lb would be sturdier. Good price for the amount though.,3
B07D4YF3K4,Night white,5
B07D4YF3K4,"I liked that this paper stock was the perfect weight. I bought this to do flyers. After printing on a laser printer, they ink did NOT smudge. I bought this item twice and would buy it again.",5
B07D4YF3K4,"The product overall was good, packing was bad. Product packaging came ripped and the corners of my paper bent.",3
B07D4YF3K4,"I got this cardstock for printing Valentines Day cards and other 'in house' projects for personal/family and non-professional use.  I have learned to always hold the cardstock by its edges. When I pick it up firmly with my hand, small creases form where my thumb grabs on. This isn't a huge problem for the projects I'm using it for but if you want something that will carry a more professional look, I would choose a thicker cardstock.",4
B07D4YF3K4,"always buy this every year for myself and my grand daughter, good quality card stock",5
B07D4YF3K4,"I need to send out postcards to members of an organization. I print on card stock and then cut to size. I wish this paper were heavier. It works as a post card, but very flimsy.",3
B07D4YF3K4,back up paper for my printer,5
B07D4YF3K4,Was more like #65 weightNot heavy enough.,4
B07D4YF3K4,I love this paper. Great quality.,5
B07D4YF3K4,"Love this cardstock, nice and thick. Thank you!!",5
B07D4YF3K4,"The description says ""Lightweight"" and it is!  I don't understand how they can call it 90 lb.  It is heavier than regular paper but even lighter than typical cover stock.  I would not consider this paper ""card stock"" at all.",4
B07D4YF3K4,I think this product is better than others.,5
B07D4YF3K4,They are so many different sizes and all have the same color paper it is wrapped in.....there is a big difference between the price...$12.00 to $21.00 a pack and you got to read everything!!!,5
B07D4YF3K4,Good for coloring,5
B07D4YF3K4,As a teacher I am always looking for a good quality product at a reasonable price! This is that item. There is amazing print quality and it is very versatile. I have never had any issues with bleeding and I ha e purchased this item several times.,5
B07D4YF3K4,"I create my own greeting cards as well as creating junk journals and I use a lot of paper of various weights for different parts of my journals.  This brand of card stock is my go to favorite.The color, weight, and how the ink prints out on this paper is amazing.I have purchased various weights of this brand and all of them work so well.If you have substantial printing needs this is a perfect paper for that!",5
B07D4YF3K4,These are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears. I bought the eargasam brand after this and like them much better.,2
B07D4YF3K4,"The package arrived ripped, but most of the paper was OK (a few pieces were bent).  However, this is very thin and doesn't feel like 90 lb to me.  I am on the fence about returning it, but I really needed it this morning so I might be stuck with it.  Will not be ordering this again.",2
B07D4YF3K4,"Package open, definitely not new. Particularly frustrating when ordering a 300 count Package of paper that is helpful to have in the Package when transporting to my classroom and it's frustrating to need to count 300 pieces of cardstock to make sure I received all of the paper I need.",2
B07D4YF3K4,Use these for business and homeschooling projects. Great quality. Always ships in record time.,5
B07D4YF3K4,I have a 65lb paper at home which is thicker than the 90lb I purchased.,4
B07D4YF3K4,"Unfortunately, this is too thick to go through HP OfficeJet Pro 9025 inkjet printer properly, as I found out the hard way today. Hoping to spare others the trouble.",4
B07D4YF3K4,"This cardstock is thinner and much more flexible than a stack of 65lb cardstock I purchased from Hobby Lobby. If it were truly 90lb cardstock it would be thicker and less flexible than the 65lb cardstock. It's not as thin and flexible as ordinary copier paper, but is not sturdy enough for its intended purpose.",2
B07D4YF3K4,"I love this paper been ordering it for years but I wish they would have better packaging, look like the paper been in a world war before it arrived to me lol hahaha but glad my paper didn't get damaged.",5
B07D4YF3K4,"I am a teacher and my colleagues and I loooove this paper. My best friend and I like to collage, make cards etc. and this is a dream to work it. I used it for my entire classroom. My decor was printable from Etsy, and with this paper (laminated of course) bound to last me a while. So cute to collage with as well!",5
B07D4YF3K4,"The ream was open, and had been dropped on one corner wrinkling many pages.  I could not use for a commercial project.  It was not damaged in shipping.  Seller forced me to return to get $ back.  I live remote, and had to drive 20 miles to do so.  NOT HAPPY!!!",2
B07D4YF3K4,"I have purchased this item many times this year. It feels smooth, prints well with my printer, cuts easily, came in great condition, and is the cheapest product I could find.",5
B07D4YF3K4,Use this for my Students for paper I want them to keep and save. Works well and works in a copier.,5
B07D4YF3K4,This cardstock is a nice weight for making greeting cards or making a variety of boxes and pouches.  It runs smoothly through the copier for printing images.,5
B07D4YF3K4,"I do papercrafting and make greeting cards for my friends and family. This is the second package of Neehah cardstock in the last few years. It's a great weight, and I enjoy making basic white cards with individual decor.",5
B07D4YF3K4,I am organizing recipes in notebooks. This paper is the perfect weight for pages placed within plastic sleeves and then inserted into a notebook.  I certainly will be reordering in the future.  Thanks! Second order...I love this paper for my recipe notebooks. Thanks. This is a reorder and I love the quality and weight of this paper. Thanks.,5
B07D4YF3K4,"I needed this paper for cards I make.Today the package arrived with outer box torn open and inside wrapping of the ream of paper badly torn. Fortunately it is not wet, just damp.I hope I can use it.",4
B07D4YF3K4,Evil necessity printing paper.Girls gotta business to run!,5
B07D4YF3K4,"The ream of paper was packaged well in a box, but the corners of the ream were torn a little bit. All the pages look good! Unfortunately the paper isn't as thick as I was hoping for. I'm not very knowledgable about types of paper...I just know that this is thinner than the card stock I get at Walmart, the office depot brand card stock, and the index that I get at a local office supply store. When you hold the paper up by the bottom corner, it easily flops down.",4
B07D4YF3K4,good quality. prints nicely,5
B07D4YF3K4,This cardstock was just what I needed to do print jobs for my classroom. The quality is great for the price. This paper is just what you need to do all the cardstock printing you need.,5
B07D4YF3K4,Sadly I was disappointed my packed of paper can in damaged.,2
B07D4YF3K4,Order this card stock for wedding invitations. Is not in between being thick and flimsy.,5
B07D4YF3K4,I make homemade get well cards. I needed a good card stock for printing. I found this to be just what I needed at a very good price.,5
B07D4YF3K4,Very thick....off color...not true white,4
B07D4YF3K4,I purchased this to use for my adult coloring book. I copied the page and printed it out on this. It is a nice and thick quality of paper,5
B07D4YF3K4,"The paper is great, not sure if I actually got 300 sheets because it was already ripped open and sent to me like garbage. It's the principal of it. I would like to store this paper in it's original container to keep it nice and unbent. Anyway paper great, whoever packed and shipped it should have their head examined.",2
B07D4YF3K4,I previously bought 67lb cardstock of this brand. I paid more for the 90lb because I need thicker cardstock for my projects. This cardstock is thinner than the 67lb cardstock. Maybe a mistake was made in packaging this and it got the wrong label. I work with cardstock regularly and this is not 90lb.,2
B07D4YF3K4,This card stock is free of jam my printer accepts it without not problem the quality of this card stock is A+ and the best besides quality THE PRICE YOU CANNOT BEAT THAT !!,5
B07D4YF3K4,Unfortunately the paper was mishandled and all the reems were bent and damaged.,3
B07D4YF3K4,"I attempted to include a photo for reference,  but Amazon requires way too many permissions for it. Soooo...the outer box was in perfect condition.  However,  the paper wrap around the product has been torn open. There may be a few sheets missing, but, if so,  not enough to go through hassle of returning the item. The cardstock seems excellent for what I want (greeting cards, gift tags, etc.) I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of damage to product wrap.",4
B07D4YF3K4,"There is no way this is 90 pound cardstock. I have 65 pound cardstock that is thicker and more sturdy than this.I have a use for it, but I definitely can't use it for what I needed it for when I ordered.",2
B07D4YF3K4,Ive been using this for my small business and they print well and a great deal for what you get! The paper did come in a box with no cushioning and the packaging was ripped upon arrival but the paper itself seemed fine. If the actual product was damaged I would have asked for a return!! Other than that I found it perfectly fine. Would probably try another brand just in case.,4
B07D4YF3K4,"I've bought this item twice, and once it was a lightweight cardstock, too flimsy for my needs, and the other time it was a heavy weight to stiff for my printer.",3
B07D4YF3K4,I have an Epson 2800 and it prints perfect on this paper thickness,5
B07D4YF3K4,I loved this for printouts that were better on sturdy paper. Now I'm using with kiddos for drawing (erases pencil clean and easily...and is cheaper than regular drawing paper).,5
B07D4YF3K4,"Not very white, not very thick. Wanted to use it for quotes in a cabinet. I used one push pin and had to tape every corner for it to lay flat on the cork board. Wish I had bought better quality paper. It's OK, but not what I was looking for.",3
B07D4YF3K4,Paper seems ok but packaging was ripped when it arrived,2
B07D4YF3K4,I was so disappointed with this purchase! This is advertised as 90 lb. Cardstock when it is only copy paper. It's heavier than normal copy paper but it is NOT cardstock.,2
B07D4YF3K4,I have bought this product twice and both times it has been busted open when I received it,4
B07D4YF3K4,Perfect thickness for what I needed it for,5
B07D4YF3K4,Good good price,3
B07D4YF3K4,This cardstock works great for my needs. Its not too thick like card stock I have bought in the past and its very easy to work with.,5
B07D4YF3K4,Great cardstock for whatever you need to do with it.  Works in my printer.,5
B007VBXB48,These work great with my scotch laminator. The sheets are nice and thick. My projects get nice and sealed and are more durable.,5
B007VBXB48,"Haven't had experiences with other brands of laminating pouches, but these are fantastic and I see no reason to try other ones.  For the most part, we've been using 8.5""x11"" paper to laminate.  It is usually kid's art or some kind of infographic that we want the kids to use.  It works really well in these normal applications - easy to line up and no issues like bubbling when running through the laminator.The other application we've used it for is making bookmarks.  The kids will design a few bookmarks and we put them in the pouch with maybe half an inch of spacing in between each one.  After that we use a Fellowes Electro 120 Paper Trimmer to cut them down to the right size.  Bookmarks stay intact, look great, and don't seem to have any real sharp edges.We've laminated all sorts of things and the only times we have had issues were:1.  Glitter Art - Maybe it could seal through/around a tiny amount of glitter, but it had issues with the amounts we were using2.  Hair in the lamination - clearly user error - but fully inspect your filled pouch before you run it through the laminator!3.  Using Erasable Ink Pens.  The ink fades significantly with heat, so it doesn't hold up to thermal laminating process.",5
B007VBXB48,I was so excited to see these.  They were a great price and are durable.  They are the perfect size for letter size paper.,5
B007VBXB48,Great product great seller.,5
B007VBXB48,"I ordered this laminator in order to seal several cards (medicare, health) to keep them from getting wrinkled and torn in my wallet.  Received it in a timely manner, found it was quick to warm up to operating temperature, was easy to feed and did a satisfactorily job.  I would recommend using the 5mm thickness laminating film vs 3 mm.  It's stiffer and laminates better for a stiffer card.  Overall quite pleased with this laminator and recommend it highly for your office needs.",4
B007VBXB48,I used the laminating sheets to create a work book for my toddler! Easy to use & works well with black dry erase marker. Quality good!,5
B007VBXB48,"Got tired of always having to get laminated needs approved at work, so bought this on Prime Deal day and have been totally happy with the product. Easy to use and the lamination works very well. Never had any problems with laminated items. Highly recommend!",5
B007VBXB48,"I bought this for personal use, but I had used one at my work place. It works well and it is easy to use. Laminator  pouches and quality are good.  I would recommend it for small projects.",5
B007VBXB48,"Works great for a personal classroom or at home, heats quick and works well",5
B007VBXB48,"Laminating pouches fit well, good quality products.",5
B007VBXB48,great,5
B007VBXB48,"This is amazing in with the lamenting process. I do wish that it was already closed on the sides so it's an even lining up for the paper. But all in all, great product!",4
B007VBXB48,Great quality for making stickers.,5
B007VBXB48,I have reordered this same product a few times now and have been very happy with the product and quality each time. I will buy again when needed!,5
B007VBXB48,"Works great, love it",5
B007VBXB48,"needed to safe some important papers, these were easy to work with",5
B007VBXB48,"Works well in my laminator, use these all the time for my classroom.",5
B007VBXB48,High quality Scotch 3mil laminating pouches - Letter size 100 count. Best price!,5
B007VBXB48,Works well for what I needed it for. Will be ordering it again,4
B007VBXB48,"The product was everything I expected ,",5
B007VBXB48,I can't believe how easy these are to use! You have to get the laminator and these pouches!,5
B007VBXB48,These laminating sheets are great and sturdy. I used them in my special education classroom. They were great for Velcro projects and making schedules. I have also used them for making ID badges and gifts. Perfect!,5
B007VBXB48,"Usually these have their own box that helps protect the pouches.  This one came with the pictured covered sheet as a single piece paper.  The pouches and cover sheet were in a well sized thin box.  The box was comical in that the corners were jammed into the corners and once it was opened, it was hard to get back in a form that would allow storage.  This is not a big deal as I will use the old box.  Someone, I guess, thought this was a good idea.  At any rate, the product is still great.",4
B007VBXB48,Great for teachers,5
B007VBXB48,Scotch is a dependable brand - high quality.,5
B007VBXB48,I am very happy about these pouches.,5
B007VBXB48,"I like the one I bought before, so decided the daughter in law needed one.  It works well easy to use.",5
B007VBXB48,"Laminator quality, works well",5
B007VBXB48,Great product!,5
B007VBXB48,"Tried generic ones from a big box store. They stunk. Got a great deal on the Scotch ones on Amazon (cost only $1 more than generic), and they work fantastic with mist laminators (I have gone through two different ones).",5
B007VBXB48,Exactly as described!,5
B007VBXB48,A+,5
B007VBXB48,I like that it can take the heat from the Laminator without buckling the pouch and they stay sealed.,5
B007VBXB48,Read instructions 1st ! And let it heat up !,5
B007VBXB48,I always have a box of these in hand for laminating school projects. They work well and seal nicely.,5
B007VBXB48,Better to go with official products than some knock off. Heats up nice and pretty easy to use.,5
B007VBXB48,"Great product, just as described.",5
B007VBXB48,"I bought this because laminating pouches (for use in laminators that don't use carriers} are no longer available for HF Gordon Laminators.  This works perfectly!  I would even say that the plastic laminating pouches are superior to ones that HF used to sell for Gordon Laminators.  So don't be afraid to get out that old dusty laminator, this will make it useful again!",5
B007VBXB48,these are great and hold up well. good value,5
B007VBXB48,Totally reliable!!,5
B007VBXB48,Handy product.,4
B007VBXB48,Best purchase ever made while smoked out of my mind,5
B007VBXB48,These are easy to work with. Will order again.,5
B007VBXB48,"My Scotch Thermal Laminating Pouches came in a box that is perfectly sized to use if you don't wish to use the inner box that the laminating pouches come in. It's the little things sometimes that add even more to an already great product. I am not sure whether they meant to add this 'perk' but I fully intend on using the outer cardboard box to hold my laminating pouches because they will be much easier to access that way rather than opening the flimsier box, getting the pouch from the bag and then putting that all back together. So, whether you laminate once in awhile or a lot, these are the pouches to buy!Now, let me tell you about the laminating pouches themselves. I have tried other laminating pouches and I have never been happy with the results. These Scotch Thermal Laminating Pouches are 3mil thick so they hold up very well, have worked with a couple different thermal laminators that I have had and always give me a great final product. Other products have been flimsy, wrinkly or had other issues I have had to deal with. So, whether you laminate once in awhile or a lot, these are the pouches to buy! This order comes with 100 pouches which is a great number to have on hand!",5
B007VBXB48,I use these time and again because they are thicker than the lamination at my school. Items inside will lay flat.,5
B007VBXB48,It is really good works has a variety of sizes,5
B007VBXB48,"I am a teacher so I use these often and I love the ease and the fact that these are thicker than my schools laminate. It holds the items pretty well. Easy to cut and use! When I laminate stuff with these, the laminate does not peel off.",5
B007VBXB48,"These made me enjoy laminating things so much, they come out clear and glossy and just makes everything feel more official!",5
B007VBXB48,"Great clear lamination pages, worked very well. No bubbles.",5
B007VBXB48,The sturdiness of these sheets is perfect for keeping documents secure from damage. I have used this brand for several years.,5
B007VBXB48,I always use these.  They are easy to use and are nice and thick.,5
B007VBXB48,Wish it could have more sheets for less amount.,5
B007VBXB48,This works great and was a good value but more information in the package would have been helpful.,4
B007VBXB48,"I bought this to go in my little laminator to make flashcards and printables for the classroom. These work really well. They are thick enough to feel quality, but not so thick that they are too hard to use in the machine, will buy again.",5
B007VBXB48,These lamination pouches work so well. I use them with my scotch laminator and they are nice and thick and keep things protected so they will last longer.,5
B007VBXB48,"These sheets work really well and after the lamination process are crystal clear. My only complaint is that in order to insert the object to be laminated between the two halves of the sheet you have to separate the sheets and I find that to be a very difficult task. I spend more time trying to get the darn things separated than actually doing the job. It's frustrating. I know it's probably a  personal problem, but I'll bet that a lot of other people have this problem too. Other than that they are great.",4
B007VBXB48,Works well for the projects used on so far. Would recommend.,4
B007VBXB48,"I teach middle school science, and I put lots of self-made posters on the wall for vocabulary, models, etc.  I laminate my letter-size posters so I can re use them for many years.  These laminating pouches work well.There is only one caveat, and it might happen with all brands of laminate.  I have some probably-too-sticky adhesive discs that I use to mount posters on the wall.  They are so sticky that when I try to remove the laminated poster, the laminate disconnects from the paper before it disconnects from the wall.  This creates a weird opaque section on the poster.  It can be corrected by running the poster back through the laminator again.  It seems like the paper between the two layers of laminate is being un-laminated by the force from the adhesive discs.  I wish that wouldn't happen, but I can fix it.  I will keep using these laminating sheets and stop using the adhesive disks.",5
B007VBXB48,Do exactly what was needed.  Good price.,5
B007VBXB48,Not quite as adhesive as I had hoped.,4
B007VBXB48,We go through these in the classroom a lot! They are thick and solid once laminated and the ease of using it makes these the perfect choice!  I had no problems getting them in and out of the laminator and it was quick and quiet while using them.,4
B007VBXB48,I love these. They are compatible with many personal laminators but I use them with the scotch laminator. The pouches are durable but they never jam my machine. They are super easy to use.,5
B007VBXB48,Great,5
B007VBXB48,"I had to get these again - they have never broken on me, even with cutting! They come out great every time. Thank you!",5
B007VBXB48,"I am a former teacher who now homeschools. I used Scotch brand pouches when I was in school, when I taught, and now that I homeschool. They are strong, crisp, and can withstand lots of little hands. Coming from someone who enjoys laminating things, these pouches are my favorite!",5
B007VBXB48,All you need to know before you buy it - IT WORKS.No problems at all. Great quality,5
B007VBXB48,Feels good and durable. Straightforward to use. Pleased with the product overall.,5
B007VBXB48,"These sheets are super easy to open, very little noise, and durable. I have never had a jam will using these sheets, it is also very easy to use and the directions explain how to do it perfectly. Online they have different sizes of the laminating sheets in case you need to laminated a banner or something long. The machine is warm to the touch but not hot enough to burn you, unless you directly put your skin on it.",5
B007VBXB48,Hasta ahora me quedo con esta marca. Muy buena,5
B007VBXB48,Great price for the amount of sheets you receive.,5
B007VBXB48,So thick and durable!!,5
B007VBXB48,"A brand that can be trusted. Appreciate With Amazon, you can find hey, bigger box of what you need at a lower price.. Thank you, Amazon.",5
B007VBXB48,"I needed some things laminated and chose these pouches and the Scotch laminator because of the reviews and brand. One has to be careful with placing the item to be laminated into the center of the pouch, be careful to feed the pouch in straight and at the center of the machine and pull the lamination off of the machine and onto a flat surface as soon as it comes out to cool. I have been getting beautiful results.",5
B007VBXB48,I am a teacher and I use these to laminate everything! Love them!,5
B007VBXB48,Great pack of laminator sheets! Order these to use in my classroom!,5
B007VBXB48,"Overall, good. Does the job. But won't be a thick lamination.",4
B007VBXB48,Just what I needed at the best price.,5
B007VBXB48,These are very sturdy and well made. Nice for laminating. I'll definitely get more when this package is gone.,5
B007VBXB48,I am obsessed with these. I am a teacher and I go through many laminating sheets so these are perfect for what I need for my kiddos. I laminate all my center and group work supplies along with my posters and charts that I need.,5
B007VBXB48,"They work well for the price. I would suggest trying the Amazon brand if you are in a pinch, as they come with more for just about the same price. Easy to use and store",4
B007VBXB48,"Long durability, very easy to use.",5
B007VBXB48,Scott brand always the best.,5
B007VBXB48,This was what I was looking for and a better price then local stores.,5
B007VBXB48,These do not seem to adhere as well as my old laminating pouches - have used GBC and Duck. Usually need to run through laminator twice - hardly ever had to do this with old pouches. Material being laminated does not seem to affect adherence.  Have not used a lot of these so the final verdict is still out but so far a little disappointing.,4
B007VBXB48,Outstanding quality and clarity,5
B007VBXB48,I no longer have to wait to use the school laminator or borrow from a friend.  I should never have waited so long to but my own laminator and sheets.,5
B007VBXB48,NA,5
B007VBXB48,Easy to use and they seal great.,5
B007VBXB48,"We laminate all sorts of things, and these pouches work great. And compared to buying locally, they are a good value.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"The pack of three scissors, with three different colored handles, was a great find for a bargain price.I am using one color for different uses: one for paper; plastic; multi use.They cut well, the design is comfortable, and they seem durable enough to last a long time. They are also easy to clean.Sticky stuff? Alcohol.Wax? Heat gun.  Great buy!!",5
B07YDDX4JL,"The scissors are good quality and good value for the money. They are functional, sharp, and easy to clean.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"These scissors function as expected and well for the price.  However the advertisement is a bit misleading.  The ad said ""Heavy Duty Scissors with Ultra Sharp Blades and Comfort Grip Handles"" but I think they are medium duty scissors as they struggle cutting cardboard, and while they have reasonably sharp blades, they are not ultra sharp.  And the handles are a bit small for my hand, as they feel a bit cramped when using.",4
B07YDDX4JL,"We thought that these scissors would be cheaply made and of average-quality. but after reading the reviews, we thought we would give them a try.  To our surprise and satisfaction, these scissors were comfortable when cutting, the blades are sharp, and the scissors will cut several pieces of paper and cardboard.  We found that with a little effort, we could cut 24 pieces of paper at one time (but not cleanly or in straight cuts). The manufacturer states that these scissors will remain sharp for 100,000 + cuts, so time will tell.  Highly recommended.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"I have been needing general scissors for my home for awhile. As a sewist, I have plenty of shears, but they're all for fabric only and I wouldn't want to cut paper or trim flower stems with them. This bundle helped perfectly. I put one pair in my office, one on my craft table and one in my kitchen so now I'm all set. The handles are colored so I can tell which room they're from if they ever travel around the house. They seem quite sharp and the 4"" blades should be able to cut through most home tasks. They open and close easily. I can easily distinguish them from my sewing shears which should now never disappear. Great bundle.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"I must say that I'm quite pleased with these scissors. I bought these for a school sewing class and they have done a fantastic job. They are sharp and cut easily through most fabrics. They've kept their edge and have not gotten dull even after a few months of sewing class. I do recommend these if you're looking for a good, sharp, all purpose scissor.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"In my household scissors or something you can never find when you need them. So I've bought a couple of sets of these scissors. Obviously would recommend them because I bought them more than once. They're very sharp, I've used them in many different ways from cutting material to trimming my bangs. They work really great. Would recommend buying them for any of your crafting or home needs?.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"Scissors. Who wants to spend money on scissors, much less do the research to find the best fit for you? Well, I have been relying on an old pair handed down from my mother, a pair of Walmart cheapies and .99 cent plastic handle jobs. After the plastic handles of both of the latter broke, I decided it was time to ""invest"" in a good pair of scissors. These really fit the bill! The handles are solid, but cushioned, the blades thick and sharp. The 3 pack is wonderful...one for the office for paper and the like, another for the backyard for garden string, etc. and one for the kitchen for all the child proof packaging that I cannot seem to open at 66 years of age!",5
B07YDDX4JL,"Good scissors for the price, should say very good for the price. Well made with careful toe in angles, steel if of good quality for the blades. Should last for long time cutting textiles or paper, or aluminum foil or such soft materials.",5
B07YDDX4JL,I like that this is a bundle pack of 3. We seem to lose everything and having backups are always a plus. The price was reasonable and the color choice was nice. They cut well and are durable.,5
B07YDDX4JL,I needed scissors for my gift wrapping tools and as Christmas is the biggest season of gift wrapping I looked for Christmas themed scissors.  So glad I did as these not only fit the season theme they are sharp and work very well in cutting wrapping paper!,5
B07YDDX4JL,"I had another famous brand scissors that broke in less than a year.These scissors cut extremely well.  First I tried cutting through 5 24lb copy paper in one go and it cut like butter.  Then I tried cutting through 10 sheets of copy paper all at once and it still cut easily.These scissors are extremely sharp.  They are very comfortable to hold.  For the $8 I paid, I consider these a true bargain.  I would pay $8 for just one of these scissors as the quality is outstanding.",5
B07YDDX4JL,These are staying sharp and work on heavier materials. I like buying a pack of three and having them in different places so as not to use up one and constantly need to buy another. Worth the money and good quality!,5
B07YDDX4JL,"Only minus is, the size is actually bigger than usual .  I was hoping for smaller for than that for simple office use, but that's not a problem of the product",5
B07YDDX4JL,I bought the 3 pack of scissors because I can't seem to locate a pair when I need one.I used them to cut wrapping paper and open Amazon boxes. They worked well - sharp and sturdy. I think that they are a very good buy.,5
B07YDDX4JL,"For the price, these scissors are amazing! I struggle to cut of the plastic rings the the warehouse stores use to sell 2 packs of milk, etc. With these scissors, I am no longer struggling!!!  I am buying a second package.",5
B07YDDX4JL,inexpensive but excellent quality.  I may buy another pair as scissors have a way of getting lost in kitchen and bathrooms...I like these for ordinary use.  They wash well in dishwasher.,4
B07YDDX4JL,"These are great scissors, very sharp and functional. I like to keep a pair in the kitchen, in the office, and one for the kids crafts.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"I've only had them about a month, but so far they work really well, and have help up to 4 of us using them for everything we need to cut.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"I have two kids who have lost or misplaced 6 pairs of scissors.  These are great, sharp and solid enough, holes that fit larger fingers",5
B07YDDX4JL,I got tired of never being able to find a pair of scissors. These had good reviews so I got a pack of three.1. Very easy to get out of the package2. They seem to cut just fine.When these disappear I will get the same ones again.,5
B07YDDX4JL,Nice and heavy  came oiled  like expensive scissors like the three colors to seperate use in different rooms Cut good !,5
B07YDDX4JL,"My old scissors were no longer sharp.  I use scissors all the time, to cut produce bags, packages and wrapping paper, cutting price tags off of clothing and many other things.  Therefore I was happy this package of three meant I could leave a scissors in three different places around the house.  The bright colors are attractive.  What can I say?  They're scissors, and work well.",5
B07YDDX4JL,Excellent food and durable material,5
B07YDDX4JL,Great item! As described,5
B07YDDX4JL,Wife loved them,5
B07YDDX4JL,Scissors are scissors and they are scissors.,5
B07YDDX4JL,I use these to cut cotton quilt squares. They are very sharp and cut straight. They do a great job for a nice price. I am pleased!,5
B07YDDX4JL,"I purchased these for a bargain. In all seriousness, you can't have enough good scissors. They all somehow grow legs and walk off. I'll be purchasing more if these decide to leave.",5
B07YDDX4JL,You will not be disappointed in these scissors.,5
B07YDDX4JL,"iBayam 8"" All Purpose Scissors are perfect, I have pair in my desk drawer, in my kitchen draw, and in my bathroom cabinet. They are great.",5
B07YDDX4JL,These are fine.Enjoy the colors &designs.,5
B07YDDX4JL,"These scissors are nice to have handy in drawers throughout the house--and it saves my ""good"" fabric scissors from being used for nefarious non-fabric purposes!  Well worth the money.",5
B07YDDX4JL,Great for the price,5
B07YDDX4JL,Sharp scissors. Very useful. Well worth the cost.,5
B07YDDX4JL,My wife really like your scissors. Replaced some older very cheaply made scissors around the house.,5
B07YDDX4JL,Works great!,5
B07YDDX4JL,Great,5
B07YDDX4JL,Good price and they keep their edge,5
B07YDDX4JL,Love these! It's always nice to have sharp scissors around the house!,5
B07YDDX4JL,They are scissors they work what else can I say?Kind of cheap but have used two of them over the holiday season and are working fine. I would recommend for medium to light duty.,4
B07YDDX4JL,"I have nothing but positive comments about these 3-pack scissor case.  They are sharp, a good finger-fit, and the cost was excellent. Cuts things beautifully. This was a great deal.",5
B07YDDX4JL,Makes big paper into small paper!,5
B07YDDX4JL,Absolutely love these scissors!  The colors are modern and they cut beautifully.  Plus they're lightweight enough to be very comfortable and easy to use.  And...you're going to see another review similar to this one since I also ordered another 3 pack of scissors!,5
B07YDDX4JL,These scissors are surprisingly very sturdy and strong. Great value!,5
B07YDDX4JL,decor-flowers in vase look lovely!,5
B07YDDX4JL,"Does it's job, good quality!",5
B07YDDX4JL,"These scissors are as pictured, meaning they color matched very well! These also cut amazingly! my family has been using these scissors for about a month now and we have no complaints. I loved that these came in a 3 pack as I was just looking for a new pair of pink scissors for my paper crafts and since it came with two more pairs, I just decided to upgrade some of the scissors in our other rooms. Would buy again!",5
B07YDDX4JL,As Advertised.,5
B07YDDX4JL,I liked that they were super sharp and a great value for a 3-pack. They are very sturdy and I would recommend them.,5
B07YDDX4JL,Sharp and rust proof.,4
B07YDDX4JL,These scissors are great. They are sharp and great for multiple uses. I highly recommend them for whatever your cutting needs are.,5
B07YDDX4JL,"Feel good, sharp, cut well,",5
B07YDDX4JL,Very easy to use and clean works great .,5
B07YDDX4JL,"I got these for my Mom and I love them.  Three pair are very handy to leave in the places you need them most often.  The handles are well fastened to each other making for a tight, precision cut.  Unlike the lose scissors I absolutely hate!  They are sharp and are ergonomic/easy to hold/handle.  Inexpensive great choice!",5
B07YDDX4JL,work great,5
B07YDDX4JL,These scissors are great.  They are very sharp and have remained sharp with very heavy use.  I highly recommend them.,5

B07YDDX4JL,Very nice and sharp,5
B07YDDX4JL,The scissors feel good on the hand. Josie,5
B07YDDX4JL,I pitted these scissors against a mighty and terrible plastic bag. 2 cut them. The third pair lost and the bag passed between the blades accomplishing nothing. I tried to tighten them but they are tight.,4
B07YDDX4JL,Perfect for a household with more than 1 person as we can keep a pair of scissors in several places. Perfect for wrapping gifts at the holidays.,5
B07YDDX4JL,Good quality and price,5
B07YDDX4JL,Good value and scissors are sharp,5

B07YDDX4JL,Purchased this 3 pack because they are always getting lost or stolen or misplaced.Great scissors and very sharp.,5
B07YDDX4JL,Absolutely wonderful scissors for an affordable prize!,5
B07YDDX4JL,"Slides through wrapping paper like slicing through butter. Came well packaged. Very sharp. Works well. Standard size. Standard weight. Grip does not slip. Seems tough and durable. I use them to cut stickers, so it does get a little difficult to clean, but not a deal breaker. Any adhesive removed usually works.",5
B07YDDX4JL,"The scissor came sharp and cut well and accurate. The quality seems good, and the size is good for my larger hands, so many scissor are small and my finge red s can't fit or get stuck. The close tight and stick closed. They claim to be rust resistant but time will tell. Good for kitchen/junk drawer scissors, plus a three pack for cheap means if they break, you have back ups.",4
B07YDDX4JL,"Now cuts great,good grip comfort, easy opening",4
B07YDDX4JL,Scissors are sharp. Handles fit well and make using easy. Surprised at the quality for a fantastic price.,5
B07YDDX4JL,very good,5
B07YDDX4JL,I love these scissors. They cut well and so far are holding the cutting edge. I am a crafter and have cut multiple pieces of wired ribbon at one time. These are awesome.,5
B07YDDX4JL,Quality product.  Great value for the price.,5
B07YDDX4JL,"Nice and sharp, and easy to clean",5
B07YDDX4JL,"I bought these scissors because I had abused all of the all purpose ones I had decided to spring for a replacement pack of 3.  I also bought a pair of heavy duty Stedi scissors for tough cutting.  I tested both on clam shell and cardboard packaging and they worked equally well.  I did not see that these were less effective, but  can only think, that over time, these might not stand up to tough cutting for a long period of time so I'll use these as they were built to be used and reserve tough cutting for the tougher scissors .  This 3 pack seem very well constructed and am relieved to have some working scissors!",5
B075NYWF5P,Does the job! Has rulers to line up your paper. Seems pretty sharp. Not sure how well it will work on thick paper yet. Works well on copy paper,5
B075NYWF5P,Lightweight and easy to use.  Smooth cuts!  I have NO idea how to release that little side gizmo tho.,5
B075NYWF5P,"I just need something small to cut occasional papers (mostly for art projects). This is perfect for my needs. Color is nice, great durability, light weight, very affordable! Small enough to store away easily. Love it!",5
B075NYWF5P,"This is a pretty good paper cutter. I've had it occasionally snag and ruin a cut, but once I got used to it's quirks, it works pretty well. The size it nice and it's worth it if you aren't cutting huge amount of papers that often.",4
B075NYWF5P,"Does exactly what I need it to do for a great price. I use it to cut my vinyls. Super easy to use, blade is nice and sharp.",5
B075NYWF5P,"The Firbon A4 Paper Cutter 12 Inch Titanium Paper Trimmer was purchased during November of 2018 for the price of $22.98 plus tax. It's now available for the price of $10.99 plus tax (December 4, 2024).I use the Firbon A4 Paper Cutter 12 Inch Titanium Paper Trimmer during the process of making custom greeting cards. Not only does it save time during the process of cutting the myriad of different paper products that eventually become an extremely attractive greeting card, I only have to continue using scissors to cut curves!AND, the cuts are exact. When making homemade custom greeting cards, one of the objectives is to eliminate any unnecessary indications of it being ""homemade"". Eliminating inexact cuts is one of those objectives. This craft paper cutter does exactly that...it helps to eliminate inexact cuts....very effciently.The blades supplied are extremely sharp and durable. I've been using my paper cutter for 6 years now without having to change the blade...yet. I did obtain extra blades during the original order.Now, the price has been reduced to less than half of what I paid. So, for those of you who have been using scissors to cut straight lines...STOP....and get you one of these! It really is now a ""steal""!",5
B075NYWF5P,"I send letters with my Christmas cards every year and always hated having to fold an inch over to fit in the envelope.  Some years, I would cut the paper narrower with scissors.  Not only did it not look good, but it was time-consuming.  This year, I decided to buy this paper cutter.  I don't remember how many pages it's supposed to cut at once, but I chose to just do about 6-10 at a time.  I was finished in 2 minutes and had a nice, clean professional finish!  I can't believe I didn't do this years ago.  The blade was plenty sharp.  Even if I only get another couple years of letters out of it, it will still be worth the price!",5
B075NYWF5P,Thank goodness to the person that invented this product. I use my cricut often and love how this makes straight lines and I don't waste product at all. The size is perfect for all my rolls and fits perfectly in my desk. It's light and is easily stored.,5
B075NYWF5P,"This is just what our household needed.Trimming pictures?  We got youMaking cards? No ProblemNeed to cut an angle? This one has that!Honestly though a very solid unit that does exactly what we needed. I can't cut a freehand straight line to save my life - but I am OCD when it comes to cutting and trimming things like pictures!Don't expect to cut multiple pages at once with this home unit, but for day to day use - it works fantastic and even has a replaceable cutter.",5
B075NYWF5P,Excellent. Very light. Simply push down and slide. Makes a part of my job so much simpler. Definitely recommend.,5
B075NYWF5P,"I knew I needed this, but didn't realize how much I'd end up using it. Def recommend!",5
B075NYWF5P,"I love this paper cutter, it works so well for my scrapbooking projects. I have been using it for over 500 photos and it is still just as sharp as when I got it! All the lines in the board make it easy to ensure 90 degree angle cuts. Love!!!",5
B075NYWF5P,Nice and sharp,5
B075NYWF5P,Perfect for what I need in my craft area.,5
B075NYWF5P,This product works beautifully.  Cutting is easy and clean.  I can cut several pieces at one time.  I have been struggling with an old cutter that was so dull and did not cut cleanly.  I'm so happy I only wish I had moved sooner to get a new cutter.  I already have replacement blades.  My old one didn't have that option to change the blade.  No more raggedy cuts for me ever again!,5
B075NYWF5P,"works, and stores easily",5
B075NYWF5P,"Works just like it should, no issues",5
B075NYWF5P,Works great. Refills fit perfectly,5
B075NYWF5P,Such nice smooth cuts,5
B075NYWF5P,Good value for money.,5
B075NYWF5P,I use this making crafts The only negative thing I would say is the color black I think you would be easier to line up it was a lighter color it cuts very smoothly and is very easy to use,4
B075NYWF5P,Cuts straight unlike my other one. Very useful in cutting paper straight. Also works well cutting coffee straws shorter for you know what.,5
B075NYWF5P,Worked for trimming a calendar.,4
B075NYWF5P,I absolutely love it! It is a quality product that works beautifully! I would definitely recommend this product!!,5
B075NYWF5P,It works great for it being inexpensive and small.Really pleased.,5
B075NYWF5P,Very well pleased with this purchase,5
B075NYWF5P,Just as described,5
B075NYWF5P,Easy to use. Can cut any stock from paper to cardstock.,5
B075NYWF5P,We have a large heavy device that we still have but it is in a locker. I was tired of going to the locker every time I needed to create a new user card. I might need it one a week and it could be 25 cards.,4
B075NYWF5P,easy to use and a very sharp blade,5
B075NYWF5P,It works well for paper and cardstock.,5
B075NYWF5P,I definitely recommend this easy to use cutter,5
B075NYWF5P,Perfect tool. Did exactly what I needed it to do.,5
B075NYWF5P,Used for the first time today and have to say I'm impressed.Cut quality: Clean cuts with sharp bladeLight weightEasy to useReminds me of a tile cutter but much easier to manipulateImpressive design; I almost bought a more expensive heavier option but this is so much better.,5
B075NYWF5P,"I priced this at a local store and the paper cutter WITH additional replacement blades totaled more than this paper cutter alone.  It has precise measurements and can cut on a horizontal, vertical and 45 degree angle with precision. It's perfect for older people whose hands shake.",5
B075NYWF5P,Cute the paper good and I can do a couple pieces of paper at the same time,5
B075NYWF5P,So smooth and accurate - easiest cutter ever.  Return policy not so easy though so careful ordering. I bought an extra by mistake but decided to just keep it when k saw ups with boxing was the only  free option.,5
B075NYWF5P,This is a great tool to have in your home office for small projects. My daughter also uses it for school projects.,5
B075NYWF5P,"Great product, cuts w/ ease, razor sharp lines!  Gone are the days of trying to eyeball cutting sheets in a straight line, only to have it look poor.  Wish I would have purchased this sooner -- my family uses it multiple times a week for routine things we never knew would be made easier with a paper cutter!",5
B075NYWF5P,This is a great little paper cutter for small projects.  I love it,5
B075NYWF5P,"I love that the blade hides until it is ready for use. Other than that it is absolutely wonderful, nice clean cuts, all the guidelines make life easy.",5
B075NYWF5P,"I love the grids on this new cutter that made my newest project a breeze! The blade was very sharp, making clean smooth edges.",5
B075NYWF5P,Works well. Easy to read. Arm/ ruler moves freely,5
B075NYWF5P,So far it is cutting paper as expected.  Used it for a few Christmas crafts.,5
B075NYWF5P,I was quite impressed. You can cut about five sheets with no problem.,5
B075NYWF5P,"I can not get a straight, even cut. The blade is sharp enough and slices right through photo paper and lightweight cardboard. The cutting board itself is durable but very lightweight so keeping it stable/ secured during a cut can be challenging. I'm not sure if it's operator error or a design flaw, but as I said I can not get an even cut... even when the paper is perfectly aligned to the board.",3
B075NYWF5P,This has been by far the best purchase I have made in a paper cutter. It is so precise that I love it!! Many other brands make it hard to make a straight cut but this one does not! So simple and can fit anywhere. This was definitely worth my money!!!!!,5
B075NYWF5P,This is a great cutting tool for personal and crafting use. I can finally cut paper in a straight line! Not recommended for high business use but works fine for single sheets. Great price for a very useful tool.,4
B075NYWF5P,She loves it!,5
B075NYWF5P,Works as intended and is very easy to use. I just wouldnt do too much at one time it gets a little harder with too many sheets.,5
B075NYWF5P,Not Bad,4
B075NYWF5P,"I think my expectations were a little to high for this paper cutter, even though it was cheap to begin with. It's pretty small, and the cutting mechanism feels a little off to me. Like it's not quite sharp enough to cut a perfectly straight line of my thick bristol drawing paper. But. It works, it does the job for $10",4
B075NYWF5P,"Nice sharp, straight cuts.Works great for intended use.",5
B075NYWF5P,Easy to see lines for cutting and measuring. Also you have to push down to cut so you can go over your paper and it will not cut. Great for the price.,5
B075NYWF5P,I don't like that on the first day of using it the blades already seems to have to be replaced,4
B075NYWF5P,...I figured out a couple of hacks for it.Hack 1: Try to cast a shadow line from the groove down through the paper where you want to cut by moving the cutter and paper accordingly with the light shining from the side.Hack 2: Close the guard and put a laser with rounded tip directly down straight on the opening / center of the guard and shine it into the groove and just slide the laser down your paper from there and adjust paper accordingly as needed.Images attached for reference.,5
B075NYWF5P,Arm extension works but gaps and wobbling can cause errors in measurements and must always use grid on base to ensure a straight cut which is not possible on small cuts. Still a good product but needs improvement.,4
B075NYWF5P,For the price and for light use it will do. It cuts clean and accurately but it's a bit too flimsy. The side ruler that pulls out doesn't stay put and I have to use a piece of tape to hold it in place. I wish it had a marker to cut repeated cuts although another piece of masking tape does the trick. I haven't needed to replace the blade but when it comes to that I will definitely upgrade to a Fiskar brand.,3
B075NYWF5P,I had to cut down some photos for a school project for my child. This trimmer made it so easy. I'm excited to use it to divvy up my kids' school photos next time we get them. I've been using a scissors to do that for so long. The trimmer will be much quicker and more precise.,5
B075NYWF5P,This worked great for scrapbooking. it was perfect for 12x12 pages also.  Cuts great and does not get bunched up when it does.  It even cuts through cardstock paper.  Very good product!,5
B075NYWF5P,I use this to cut about 5 sheets of label paper at a time when we make stickers and it works great.,5
B075NYWF5P,"I guess the blade is titanium, but the rest of it is 100% plastic, and it feels cheap. Not only isn't the plastic ridged, the ruler that holds the cutting blade has some play in it too. Since the blade is held in a groove, I don't think it affects cutting much. As long as you got a nice flat table to operate it on it isn't really a problem, and the blade runs smooth on the track without any jerkiness. Even just setting it on my leg I was able to get a clean cut on 250gram glitter paper. I decided to give it 5 stars because it was only $10 and it does the task I bought it for. The blade is good, and they didn't cheap out there, it cuts smooth and glides smooth. It just isn't ""over engineered"", if you want something that is going to cut through CD's and that you can pass on to your grandkids, or even something that won't break if you drop it, then you probably want to look elsewhere and spend more money. But if you are trying to cut out a few business yourself, this will do that, and probably just as well as the $25 brand name one that is also just made out of plastic. It just would have been nice if they made it a little less ""flimsy"" feeling.",5
B075NYWF5P,this works very well. just wish it would cut through more at 1 time or thicker items better,4
B075NYWF5P,very handy,5
B075NYWF5P,So glad I got this. It is wonderful and works great!,5
B075NYWF5P,"The Fibron A4 Paper Cutter cuts perfectly.  I have a Cricut and make a lot of cards and posters.  This paper cutter cuts precisely when designing a craft.  I use it to cut cardstock, construction paper and a ton of vinyl.  The lift up guide allows placement of the material and measuring with the multiple angles is perfect.  The blade is sharp and cuts perfectly.  I have had this item for 3 months and the sharpness of the blade has not diminished.  I highly recommend this cutter and would buy it again!",5
B075NYWF5P,Just the right size,5
B075NYWF5P,Perfect when you need to cut small projects of paper.,4
B075NYWF5P,"An essential for my small business, especially when cutting labels. Sometimes it does jam which leaves some labels tearing or coming out jagged but other than those minor mishaps, I would recommend.",4
B075NYWF5P,"Small, light weight and cuts what I need cutting.",5
B075NYWF5P,"This paper cutter is a great value for the cost. It is very easy to use. I did notice that tha blade dulls quicker  than I expected., but I am cutting a high volume of card stock.",4
B075NYWF5P,Works well for small jobs,5
B075NYWF5P,Very handy and cuts paper good.,5
B075NYWF5P,The ease and portability of the cutter is really nice.,5
B075NYWF5P,"It cuts good, but a bit too light.  i will keep it anyway.",4
B075NYWF5P,"Small enough to be portable, cuts well through card stock.",5
B075NYWF5P,I've had this for about 6 months now and it's great. Easy to store (I don't have a lot of space) and easy to use. Haven't had a need yet that it couldn't meet (though I really am only doing 1-4 sheets of printer paper at a time).,5
B075NYWF5P,It cuts a lot better than my other paper cutter with the blade arm. You can see the line where it will cut better than my other one. Only down side is you can only do like 5 sheets of paper at a time.,5
B075NYWF5P,It lightweight and it looks good but it is just ok. It has a hard time cutting through one card stock piece of paper.,4
B075NYWF5P,"Works great, good quality cut, and light weight.",5
B075NYWF5P,My children and I are constantly needing to trim paper or pictures for projects. This makes work a cinch. Very crisp clean edges.,5

B003ULCZ7M,"Sticks very well, last a long time, perfect size for the kiddos great value for money",5
B003ULCZ7M,"I used to buy the full size sticks of these but the smaller size is much more convenient and easier to apply preciously where you want it.  I generally use it for sealing envelopes but have also used it to successfully repair a 5x8 wooden picture frame.  I bought the 12 pack because it was discounted and a great deal.  I expect that will last awhile for me but if you have children, everyone can be using their own at the same time.  Very happy with my purchase and I like the disappearing purple color because you can see precisely where you have applied it or if you missed a spot.  Great product!",5
B003ULCZ7M,i like this product. great quality. works amazing.  great price. all around happy,4
B003ULCZ7M,I got this glue to make vision boards. It fit everything perfectly for my needs as it stuck perfectly for my needs. The purple glue is best,5

B003ULCZ7M,Good package,5
B003ULCZ7M,Last year the teacher requested 2 glue sticks from each student but half way thru the year she was asking for more. I was prepared this time with a big pack!,5
B003ULCZ7M,nice,5
B003ULCZ7M,Love it!,5
B003ULCZ7M,Great item,5
B003ULCZ7M,I like that it's purple because it drys clear. You know when its dry,4
B003ULCZ7M,works like glue,4
B003ULCZ7M,Works very well to see the area that you have applied glue to and disappears nicely. Great for kids as well as adults. Personally I use it for paper black powder cartridges with great success.,5
B003ULCZ7M,Good,5
B003ULCZ7M,Pleased,5
B003ULCZ7M,Elmers...the best,5
B003ULCZ7M,"I haven't used this product on anything but my eyebrows, for well over a decade now. No other glue stick beats it.I've tried the clear stick, meh. I've even tried the Extreme Elmer's glue stick, meh.Something about the formula of the disappearing purple works magic.Tip: On the last layer, cus it does take at least a couple layers depending on your specific eyebrow hair type, lick it. Yes, you read the correctly, LICK IT!  I'm no scientist, but I think what happens is the digestive enzymes in your saliva break down the glue just a bit, making your final coat go on super smooth. Just try it! I swear I ain't punkin' you.This product is non-toxic, as it is typically marketed toward and used by children. But, that being said, lick at your own risk.My pack did come a little man-handled, but that is on Amazon, not Elmer's. Everything was there though, in spite of the plastic being basically fully removed from the cardboard.",5
B003ULCZ7M,What I needed at a great price,5
B003ULCZ7M,Never failed us yet.,5
B003ULCZ7M,Good product for kids crafts.  Sticks well.,5
B003ULCZ7M,This item came on time and they were used for home schooling and seemed a good value for the money.,5
B003ULCZ7M,Sticks really well.  Also great for mixed media.,5
B003ULCZ7M,My kid is still working on knowing the proper amount of glue to apply to a given project so buying these in a 12 pack is great because she wont run out anytime soon.,5
B003ULCZ7M,No problems.,5
B003ULCZ7M,Scimpy amt,4
B003ULCZ7M,Great price and value,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Bought this twelve pack when the price was reduced. Great buy, great quality. Love using the purple because you can see when applying the glue to white paper and the purple truly disappears when dry. Great purchase",5
B003ULCZ7M,Got these for the kids for school. None messy last pretty long good adhesive,5
B003ULCZ7M,Great glue and so inexpensive,5
B003ULCZ7M,Good item would buy again,5
B003ULCZ7M,Easy to use share with others sticks very well still have things and activities not coming apart,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Stronger than expected. A glue stick is a glue stick and I needed it for regular glueing, however I use a notebook for work every single day and the notebook was starting to come apart from the backing(I don't know what the hard part is called?), I used the glue stick and put a thick amount and then I closed the book so the back could stick and dry all night, and since then the notebook is still intact! So the glue is pretty tough actually!",5
B003ULCZ7M,"I do a lot of crafting with my toddlers and having a sold supply of glue sticks is important, and I like Elmer's better than the generics I have purchased recently. Toddlers don't have patience and can't deal with dried out or sticky glue sticks and the elmer's glue glides nicely.",5
B003ULCZ7M,They stick anything,5
B003ULCZ7M,Durable value,4
B003ULCZ7M,My go to glue for school kids. Durable enough for small children and the bottle holds glue that lasts a long time. The glue drives clear and holds well and is made of good quality. It does not have a smell to it and it does exactly what it is intended to do.,5
B003ULCZ7M,la compre para la escuela de mi hija,5
B003ULCZ7M,Needed glue for a project where it does not permanently adhere. This will work great as it does not dry quickly and item can be slid around a little. Holds well enough to give the limited grip I need.,5
B003ULCZ7M,Used to block out my eyebrows for a costume. Stayed on long and washed off easy!,5
B003ULCZ7M,Good quality and I am happy with glue sticks.,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Comes in as shown, reducing a star since the package was slightly damaged. Keeping it since we dint have time to return and replace",4
B003ULCZ7M,"I purchased these as part of my daughter's school supply list. It was a great price for a pack of 12. And Elmer's has been the biggest name in the glue market, even when I was I young lad. No reason it is the number 1 teacher's brand.This glue is easy to use, especially compared to glue in a bottle. It goes on easy you just have to be willing to accept that if you want to cover the edges of whatever you are gluing then you will more than likely go over whatever is under it with the glue stick. I still find that it goes on smooth and is pretty clean, and easy to control. It goes on purple so that you can see exactly where you are putting it and it dries clear. It is not the best adhering glue, but it is good enough for school work and crafts. Sometimes that has even worked in my favor, where I was able to reposition what I was gluing, after I had placed it.This was a bargin for some high quality glue sticks. I am sure that I will be purchasing more next school year.",5
B003ULCZ7M,Excellent value.  Love the fact that it goes on purple and fades to clear so you can see where you put the glue. Was on sale so it was an amazing value.,5
B003ULCZ7M,I make a lot of paper crafts and I like that this glue stick is colored and I can see where the glue has been applied and where it may need more. It then dries perfectly clear. The multi pack is a great value. Thank you!,5
B003ULCZ7M,"This glue is the best there is. It's on everyone's school supply list, and it's the best price I've found three years in a row.",5
B003ULCZ7M,As described,5
B003ULCZ7M,Use to glue cigar bands onto pages easily see where the glue has been applied. Holds well. No smell.,5
B003ULCZ7M,You get exactly what you order.  Glue sticks.  Great price !,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Buying in bulk like this was helpful for the beginning of the school year. The glue itself does run out fairly quickly, especially with kids using it.",4
B003ULCZ7M,The color change is helpful for kids. Teacher preferred,5
B003ULCZ7M,It arrived just in time for back to school.,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Great for little kids since you can see where the glue goes on, but it dries quickly and DOES disappear!",5
B003ULCZ7M,"Elmer's glue, in purple hue,Disappearing like morning dew.Perfect for crafts, school days too,It sticks with ease, a dream come true.Why read reviews on glue so grand?For projects neat, just as you planned.In purple first, then clear as day,Elmer's glue shows the best way.",5

B003ULCZ7M,School glue sticks for all ages in school. They always last all year long.,5
B003ULCZ7M,perfect for my 4 years old granddaughter's  homework,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Thought these were a bargain when I first purchased them.  Finding they don't last as long as I'd hoped.  When trying to get the top off for the first use, you nearly need a steam roller.  I spent over 10 minutes the other day trying to open one. When these are gone, I'm looking for an easier to access delivery system - and not planning to buy multiples.  Give me 1 jumbo glue stick that'll last months and months please.  Glue quality is excellent...delivery system needs major improvement. Recommended with reservations.",2
B003ULCZ7M,As expected.  Appreciate the quick shipping here at the start of school when everywhere else was sold out.,5
B003ULCZ7M,Elmer's is still the best quality glue for school use.  It sticks + this is clear when dry but colored when you put it on...,5

B003ULCZ7M,School teacher here.Elmer's is the only glue I buy.,5
B003ULCZ7M,I use it to glue various stamps to card stock..works well.  For all of you that say the cap is hard to get off I thought the same thing until I immediately figured out all you need to do is twist the bottom knob and the cap pops up so you can remove it.  Magic!,5
B003ULCZ7M,"Quality adhesive, easy to use",5
B01GIJLSGG,"I've had it for a long time now and it still works great as ever. It's good for the price and punches holes in paper well. After, I can put the papers in my binder (the dimensions are correct.) It took me a few minutes to figure out how to use it though because it came with plastic protectors inside.",5
B01GIJLSGG,"Good performance, light and so cheap price",5
B01GIJLSGG,"Very fast ship, seems good quality, easily used even for multiple pages, glad to have this in my supplies drawer!",5
B01GIJLSGG,"This punching machine is solid and sturdy. Me and kids are able to use it with ease. Good looking design and light weight. Punch quality is good, it is a good quality product in terms of built quality and the operational efficiency. I am happy with this product.",5
B01GIJLSGG,Got this for homeschool. We use it on an almost daily basis. Works great!,5
B01GIJLSGG,Nice it works well,5
B01GIJLSGG,"This thing punches holes. Three of them, to be exact. No more, no less. It's a hole-punching machine, folks. It's durable and catches the little paper that it punches out and will last. I've had mine for 4 years now. Would recommend.",5
B01GIJLSGG,My old hole punch had lost its hole punching ability ( dull i guess)  This one pokes clean sharp holes in up to 4 sheets of paper,5
B01GIJLSGG,Works really well. I was able to punch through a package envelope.,5
B01GIJLSGG,I went looking for one of these today and couldn't find it. So I ordered it on Amazon and got it in a few hours. Thank you!,5
B01GIJLSGG,"I like to put copies of my tax forms and other documents in 3-ring notebooks. Printer paper with 3 holes is not always available. Too, I have previously had to buy more than needed. Being able to punch 12 pages at a time works well for me and I can use better quality paper.",5
B01GIJLSGG,Great quality,5
B01GIJLSGG,Works well on thick paper,5
B01GIJLSGG,Get the job done.,4
B01GIJLSGG,This does the job well. Highly recommend,5
B01GIJLSGG,"There are three plastic tabs on the back of the device that are flimsy and do not look like the position they should be in for safe, long-term use. The photo of the product on the back of the box shows these three plastic square parts (on the outside of the device, not the metal movable hole punchers on the inside) shows them in alignment. Not the Bostich I remember from the paper past",3
B01GIJLSGG,Great quality but there's no paper alignment stopper so it is really difficult to line up the holes.,4
B01GIJLSGG,It easily punches through multiple layers of paper. We have not counted actual sheets but are very satisfied with operation.,5
B01GIJLSGG,"Could be one only - last one of the day and worker hurried out.  OR if they are paid on piece rate, maybe faster to just stuff the parts in the box.If you look at the silver push down bar and the slots on the black base, it is easy to connect these 2 parts  with a couple of tries.  Stick the silver top (by the holes in that top) ALL lthe way into the slot on the back side of the black and then rotate the top over the bent post above the back slot.  And it works - punches nice holes.But of course, there are always some ""extra' parts  - 3 black plastic molded 1/2"" x 1/2"" x 1/8"" parts with a slot in them.  Still haven't found what to do w/ them.  The punch works without them.  But guessing they have some purpose.  If I figure it out (or if any of you know) I will update this post later.",3
B01GIJLSGG,Good product; reasonably priced;; reasonably well built; good for small job,4
B01GIJLSGG,"I didn't notice before I bought it, but this doesn't have a way to line up the paper.  So, if I put 5 sheets in and punch them, then put 5 more in, I don't have a way to make sure all the holes are in the same place.  Probably going to return this.",3
B01GIJLSGG,Works great and easy to use. A bit bulky but can cut through multiple sheets at a time.,4
B01GIJLSGG,"I like the crisp punch quality and the durability of the product.  As someone with neuropathy and sensitive hands, this product was easy to use.",5
B01GIJLSGG,"My hole punch arrived with the top cover (silver part) hanging on by a thread, and it promptly fell off when I took it out of the box.  Perhaps it is shipped this way on purpose to save space, but the punch arrived with no instructions, and two black plastic tabs fell off along with the top cover.  I believed that I had been sent a defective unit until I managed to get the cover attached.Getting the cover installed was difficult, and took several attempts.  This might have been easier with instructions.  The black plastic tabs, I believe, are for shipping purposes.  This was not obvious (and I'm still not sure) and I spent several minutes trying to determine where they needed to go.Once I got the cover on, the punch was fully operational.  It punches very well, and smoothly.  I was able to punch several laminated sheets at once, which is asking quite a lot.Be aware that this hole punch is NOT adjustable; the three holes are fixed in their position.  This works for standard 3 ring binders and such, but for other purposes, you will want a different product.I'm still uncertain if the condition I received the product in was by mistake, or if this is the standard way that it is shipped.  In the latter case, Bostich should consider including assembly instructions.  I'm a pretty smart guy, and I very nearly returned this product as broken.  I'm still not sure that it wasn't, and I'm not sure that the black plastic tabs have no function.  The finished product performs admirably, but each time I use it, I'm afraid it will fall apart again.",3
B01GIJLSGG,"This may sound ridiculous, but I had to go to YouTube to figure out where the ""integrated paper guide(s)"" were. Easy after that. Also, it arrived in two pieces so had to figure out how to assemble. Good product, just not enough consumer focus by manufacturer.",4
B01GIJLSGG,"The paper aligner on the bottom is VERY short, it's too easy for your stack of papers to go over it and miss the alignment. I wish that border was a bit taller to make alignment easier and more consistent. Other than that it's built great and works flawless so far.",4
B01GIJLSGG,I purchased this for my home office and it is very efficient! I'm very happy w/ the product- easily whole punches my documents to keep organized in my binders. Easy to store in my desk drawer. Very happy w/ this purchase.,4
B01GIJLSGG,"I needed a hole puncher for organizing home and auto paperwork into binders.I did a LOT of research on Amazon reviews, and stumbled upon this reasonably priced puncher.It's made from steel and thus it's sturdy, has a soft rubber bottom that won't scratch your table surface, and the handle offers plenty of leverage so that it punches through (12) sheets of paper like a laser!The punched holes are precise, clean, and sharp.For only $7 it fits my needs exactly, I highly recommend it!",5
B01GIJLSGG,"I've had a similar model for over 40 years, but I recently lost that one, so I replaced it with this one. Practically unchanged since the old model. Works great. I appreciate that the sides are open, so you can punch papers that are bigger than 11"" (like when you laminate something, and it's more like 12""). Large capacity waste on the bottom. Would recommend - tried and true!",5
B01GIJLSGG,"This turns out to be quite a sturdy hole.  So far, I can stick a fair amount of paper in it and it punches right through.  So I would say a great hole punch for the money.",5
B01GIJLSGG,Decent hole puncher. Doesn't work on more than a few papers at a time.,3
B01GIJLSGG,They make great products,4
B01GIJLSGG,"For the price this worked for what I needed to do. The hole puncher didnt feel cheap or flimsy but was sturdy and able to do what its supposed to do. The only annoying this was when you had to dump out the tray, you have to align it correct when placing it back on.",4
B01GIJLSGG,Very good quality. Sturdy and easy to use,4
B01GIJLSGG,This is honestly a pretty good hole puncher. It definitely does a better job than what I had before but part of the reason I got this was because it says it can punch 12 papers at one time. Technically you can punch 12 pages but it is tough to do.You would probably want to keep it under 10 pages because 10 to 12 pages give or take it gets tough to press it down and you have to basically kind of slam down your hand and apply very hard pressure or you have to stand so you can put your body weight behind your arms to really get it down for the 12 pages.Overall not too big of a deal it will take a little longer to punch holes if you have a large stack of papers that need to be punched but besides that issue the rest is perfectly fine.On the bottom of the hole puncher there is like a rubber sleeve attached to the bottom if you pull it down that's where all the little paper holes go. This makes it easy to clean. When it arrives it does have a couple of black little tabs that have to be removed so that you can work the whole puncher up and down don't try to pop them off you have to slide them off.,4
B01GIJLSGG,"When we opened the box it fell apart, but I was able to reassemble it, and it seems to work as intended.",4
B01GIJLSGG,After looking around this was the best pick & I'm Extremely satisfied with this hole puncher. Feels & looks well made; of good heavy duty quality materials & I believe will last long. The price was even better & I'm glad I bought it when I did. Great addition to my college supplies! Highly recommend.,5
B01GIJLSGG,This product works well for a home office. Whether it is kids projects going into a binder for saving or work folders. Can punch through 10 pages. Crisp cuts and always lines up. Never jammed in me yet.,5
B01GIJLSGG,Ease of use.,5
B01GIJLSGG,"The functionality of the hole puncher works admirably. It did punch through 12 sheets as is specified. I already used it two days in a row and still no jams a little hard for me but it was no hassle for my husband .The holes are cleanly cut. Its none-slip base prevents it from sliding around on the desk adding stability during use. Portable good size fits in backpacks. Durable, easy to use, and versatile enough for varies papers sizes.",5
B01GIJLSGG,It is fine.  Not much to say about a paper punch.  Mindless to use.,5
B01GIJLSGG,"very affordable and so easy to use, I make bookmark and i use to punch a hole for the tasel, this is not heavy and easy to use, does not hurt my finger and hands. I share Jesus beautiful Words to all, I use them for my bookmarks with Bible verse. Psalm 91:14-16 msg, Romans 10:9",5
B01GIJLSGG,It is perfect for what I am doing.  The price was right and the service even better.,5
B01GIJLSGG,Bought for my classroom & we all love it. It works smoothly & with minimal effort. Have ordered another because it gets a lot of use.,5
B01GIJLSGG,This 3 hole punch works great as long as you adhere to the guidelines of use .,5
B01GIJLSGG,"PERFECT for my home and home office use! Compact, sturdy & powerful. Great Value!For those who are slightly puzzled (seniors, non-mechanical people, or those having a moment of Brain Fog - LoL!) when you pull the hole punch out of the box and discover the paper won't go in far enough to be punched, make sure you remove those 2 little odd black flat clips, as shown in the photos! They are easy to remove, as long as you depress the top silver handle all the way down, while removing the 2 clips! They release the handle fully to retract the 3 hole punches, so you can fully insert the paper!Don't try prying them out without squeezing the handle together. Otherwise this could be a little frustrating and the packaging doesn't mention this. Its It's Easy when you know how! I hope this saves a few people from getting frustrated!I am Very Happy and Satisfied with this punch!",5
B01GIJLSGG,Quality item can punch multiple sheets at a time!,5
B01GIJLSGG,excelente,5
B01GIJLSGG,I like this hole puncher it has a little weight to it so it's well made. Does a perfect punch scheme with little effort.,5
B01GIJLSGG,Have used a lot and it does handle many pages at once.  Solid and no jams,5
B01GIJLSGG,"This is very simple to use, very easy and very perfect line of 3 . I am pleased with my purchase",5
B01GIJLSGG,"This product was not working specially the third punch , I requested for replacement and it got replaced within no time. This time I got the good product. Thankyou",5
B01GIJLSGG,Bought this as a quick buy and it works great,5
B01GIJLSGG,Perfect for what I needed.,5
B01GIJLSGG,It is efficient and convenient for important documents that need whole punching. It must be used precisely to get the holes punched correctly otherwise it will look awkward.,4
B01GIJLSGG,"I ordered the paper punch for personal use in my own business.  It worked exactly as stated, it traps the paper punches in a built-in, easily removed compartment.  The punch easily punches up to ten sheets of paper.  I would recommend this product for purchase.",5
B01GIJLSGG,"Slim design, lightweight and simple to use.",5
B01GIJLSGG,Works good after I fixed it after 20 minutes.,4
B01GIJLSGG,"This  three-hole puncher is smaller than I thought. It's compact  and it will not handle more than 12 sheets of paper. Comes with an easy-clean chip tray, keeping your workspace tidy. Overall, great product for small amount of paper to hole punch.",5
B01GIJLSGG,Works as expected but previous punches broke after some use. Don't know how long this one will last.,4
B01GIJLSGG,This is very easy to use and the one I needed for my work. I like very much.,5
B01GIJLSGG,"This is my 1st time purchasing a tabletop 3 hole punch. I used to just reserve my hole punches till I was on campus. With the current crisis, we can gather as to why I eventually had no choice. That being said, that explains my frustration with my inexperience. I knew there was no guide/ protruding tab for the paper but I at least thought that the ending punches would be proportional to the length of the unit. Let's just say my first couple of tries were devastating and I was furious! I came back here to try and find advice and that's when I read reviews and questions that there is no alignment, no guide, and it set in that the ending punches are not proportional to both sides. That made me even more upset. I was ready to RETURN this piece of junk. Well, I finally resolved this for my own behalf so if you're going thru the same thing, fear not!How to align paper (letter size):With the hole punch positioned perpendicular to your body, place in such a way that the ""B"" in the top lettering of ""BOSTITCH"" is closest to you. Slide paper into the appropriate compartment from the right side of the unit ( do the opposite if left-handed?). Now, this is where you will notice a subtle raised plastic where the paper bottom of the paper should rest, closest to the letter ""B"" side of the hole punch. (You wont find it on the other side) THIS IS YOUR GUIDE! Make sure both sides of the back of the paper are fully inserted and give it a go! Presto! Saved myself some trouble. Phew! I hope that helped.",4
B01GIJLSGG,It's easy for useGood qualityReasonable weightAdjustable okayJust kinda small,4
B01GIJLSGG,The PROUDCT works amazing! 10/10,5
B01GIJLSGG,"It serves it's purpose. I mean, it's a hole puncher...",5
B01GIJLSGG,"Sturdy, simple hole puncher does a good job with several sheets of paper.",4
B01GIJLSGG,It worked just fine for almost 2 years.  I will purchase a different brand to hopefully last longer this time.,3
B01GIJLSGG,I love the quality of this! It helps a lot and it can go through a big stack of paper. You are able to adjust it to different sizes depending on your need. The appearance doesn't look cheap at all for the price you pay. It opens underneath and makes it easy to clean and throw the trash away.,5
B01GIJLSGG,"Basic, functional for my home office needs.  Lightweight and can punch through at least 6pages at a time.",5
B01GIJLSGG,"So I wish I'd have taken a picture of this when it came out of the box.  Pretty sure I got one that had been returned as the box appeared to have been opened previously.  Anyway, I pulled it out and it was in 2 pieces.  Thinking that it needed to be this way to fit in the box, I expected instructions.  Nope.  Then I thought it might be broken.  So glad for people who post video reviews bc I was able to look at a couple of them and see how it should be put together.  Took me about 5 or so minutes to figure it out... which it wasn't rocket science but still.  Anyway, it works and for the flash sale price plus an additional 5% off, certainly worth it for what I need!  I do recommend, but if you receive it and its not put together, just work with it and look at videos and pics.",4
B01GIJLSGG,My hole punch broke .. yes they break especially if they are cheap. I did not even have to splurge on this hole punch - it was a great deal all around ! # winning,5
B01GIJLSGG,This was a good deal on this hole puncher but it does not have a guide to measure where your paper could be hole punched to fit in your binder or folder. You almost have to guess where the holes go to make it work.,3
B01GIJLSGG,Good quality product. Works as it should. solid and sturdy. Can cut through a lot of paper at once.,5
B01GIJLSGG,Helps me keep my binders organized,5
B01GIJLSGG,"Couldn't even fit 15 sheets of the thinnest printer paper in at once. It struggled with 8-10 sheets. Worked fine for 5 sheets. It's also not as long as A4 paper so the paper guides aren't great unless you're trying to hole punch too high or too low.This is fine for moderate home use but I would go for a different brand in a school or office environment where you have high volume hole punching.It's really sturdy and looks nice, so I'll definitely keep it for home use since I don't have to hole punch more than 20 sheets a month.",3
B01GIJLSGG,Super easy to use and perfect for organizing our home-studies!,5
B01GIJLSGG,Excellent quality and bought it on sale so that was a plus also! Surprised for the price that this one is metal. Exactly what I needed,5
B01GIJLSGG,WORKS WELL,5
B01GIJLSGG,I'm up late punching many holes without a hitch.  Does 7 or 8 easily.  Have not tried more.  Great low price for my use.,5
B01GIJLSGG,"I received an already open box. The puncher had little black pieces of something all over it and an oily substance inside that stained my pages. Beyond that, yeah, I guess it punches holes in paper.",3
B01GIJLSGG,Best hole punch.,5
B01GIJLSGG,Excellent product. Just what I wanted and needed,5
B01GIJLSGG,Works great!!,5
B01GIJLSGG,Works perfectly for price,5
B01GIJLSGG,"Ok quality, works but very difficult to line up properly.",3
B01GIJLSGG,This is the perfect little hole puncher. Easy to transport if you need to. Works just as expected! Great price for great quality.,5
B01GIJLSGG,Works great for punching 3 holes in paper,5
B00CBAWIIY,"I was in the market for a new laminator as my old one was wearing out.  It's over a decade old, it was time.  I researched other brands, I read reviews, I contemplated buying something different. Ultimately, I came back to the original laminator I already owned.  It's reliable, it works well, it heats up quickly, it is quiet and I have never have issues with jams or bubbles. I'll stick with the Scotch brand... for laminating machines and laminating sheets. Their worth the cost.",5
B00CBAWIIY,These are always a must have for my classroom! They work pretty well and are definitely worth the price. I buy a big pack every school year and use them for all sorts of different things.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I love the quality of this laminator! It works so well and is super easy to use. Highly highly highly recommend it!,5
B00CBAWIIY,"Great product!! Worked well, and quickly!! Would highly recommend!!",5
B00CBAWIIY,"I like the weight and ease of use of this laminator! It has a slide guide for insertion, a place to wrap cord underneath and even place to easily carry it. Replaced an older device and this has features the other did not--SUPER buy and improvement!  Love it!A.L. Walton",5
B00CBAWIIY,Excellent quality and price.  Great for school teachers.,4
B00CBAWIIY,"Usually laminating an 8.5 x 11 page costs around $2 a page.  This machine and 200 full lamination packets was under $80 total.  Plug in the laminator, select the thickness (I use all 3mil) and wait about 4 minutes for the ready light to come on.  Slide your page into a lamination packet and feed it into the machine.  Takes about 20 seconds to do a page.  That was it!  Every page fed through flawlessly for me.  Love this machine.  I purchased the Scotch branded packets just to avoid issues.  If you have even a few pages to laminate, this is a great purchase.  Once you have it, most likely you will find other stuff to laminate too; recipes, directions for plant care, kids weekly chore lists, etc.  Recommended",5
B00CBAWIIY,"Lite weight laminating machine.  Easy to use, quickly heats up.  Great for small offices or personal use.  Use it mostly for laminating 8x10 posters and it does a great job.",5
B00CBAWIIY,Love that I can buy these in bulk much cheaper than at other stores. I have been using them for years and they always work perfectly.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I will continually purchase this product. They are sturdy and work well for my profession.,5
B00CBAWIIY,It works but it rattles while it heats up. Even with all for points touching it makes an annoying noise. It stops when feeding it but that is it. It is light weight and laminates well.,4
B00CBAWIIY,These laminates are averageNo complaints.,4
B00CBAWIIY,"Easy to use, items come out perfect! No fog, no wrinkles or bubbles!",5
B00CBAWIIY,I bought this during the year we do not talk about to help prepare materials for my students at home.  I bought a second one when we returned to the classroom because it really is the most used item in the classroom (along with the book binder I bought).  It works excellent still months later.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I have used this and other products similar to these. These laminating sheets work great! They do not get stuck in my laminator and come out smooth with no curling. I use these sheets regularly for my classroom and 200 for this price is a great deal!,5
B00CBAWIIY,"This brand really is the best for lamination! I will buy their lamination bags over any other brand at any price, but the price when I bought these was a great deal for 200!",5
B00CBAWIIY,My Grand daughter wanted this and so I got for her for Christmas. She is in college to become a teacher and this is perfect for her needs with a carrying handle and storage.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"I use this laminator for my business. I make dry erase games. I have laminated hundreds of sets so far. It works very well and I would purchase it again.There are minor things I would change. The guide lines might as well be flat, because they're only good for a visual line up. They're way too short to actually guide anything. Secondly, the tray in the back needs to have a pull out section to make it longer. The paper just flops over the edge.These are very minor nitpicky issues.Other than that, this is a great machine. It does exactly what you want it to do. I've also laminated glossy cardstock with 3 mil sheets. I had zero issues.Note: I do always use the brand name laminating sheets. Scotch is the only brand that specifically says ""dry erase"", which is what I do.I've seen some of the bad pictures that are on here. Clearly, these people had received defective machines or used bad laminating sheets.The fact that 90% had 5 star reviews says alot.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"Laminates well, we are happy with it.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"I love the ease of opening and positioning of these pouches.  It's nice to not have to worry about the quality of each pouch too, because each one is of it's highest quality.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"I purchased this laminator in September of 2017 and it has worked amazingly!I teach preschool and use this nearly daily, some days having close to 100 sheets ran through it! It only requires time to cool after running for long periods non-stop, which is typical.Recently the roller has become louder however, it still functions perfectly!This laminator is small enough to be portable from home to school when needed. The cost makes it affordable for my budget and lasting all this years is an added bonus!I am only here now because I have recently moved rooms around, need it, can't find it, and am considering purchasing a second one.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"I have bought several of these laminators over the past few years, for the different schools that I have worked at. This is a good quality product and would recommend.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"So great! Love this laminator.  Had the previous version for over 10 years! The quality is great, laminates real quietly and no curling.",5
B00CBAWIIY,This is compact and I like that because I am limited for space. It heats up a lot quicker than my old one did. The only thing I really don't like is the guide in the back. It would be nice if it extended the length of the laminate for support. I laminate small items in one laminate and it is almost impossible to do with this one. Also the sides of the guide should be higher. You have to be very careful when loading it to be sure that it is centered and not going beyond one of those edges.,4
B00CBAWIIY,"Love this for my quick laminating I need in my classroom. It works great and the quality is exactly what I need. I use this for signs, students works, bulletin boards and more.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"This is great laminate. If you want to laminate signs etc., this is your best choice!",5
B00CBAWIIY,This is my second purchase of this item.  The last one lasted 15 years of heavy use.  Love it!,5
B00CBAWIIY,This film is the perfect thickness.  It covers well on variety of products even cardstock. Use in my classroom weekly. The film is also durable. I can wipe it off and it stays perfect. Heats up quickly.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Use these sheets regular for years at the garden center I work at. Hold up great. Never have an issue with them.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I use these all the time! They are great to have in the classroom,5
B00CBAWIIY,I use these often and love them. They are easy yo use and are the perfect size.,5
B00CBAWIIY,My daughter is a teacher. We have ordered many packages of these.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Laminate kayak maps and other stuff I want waterproof. Easy to use and not that expensive.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Great product great seller.,5
B00CBAWIIY,This is great quality! I use it for curriculum and it works great,5
B00CBAWIIY,Is good quality works great. Lays flat no bubbles.,5
B00CBAWIIY,No issues and they works as described,5
B00CBAWIIY,These laminating sheets work very well.,5
B00CBAWIIY,This is the cheapest I have found for laminating pouches.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Nothing to compare it to but it works as it should.,4
B00CBAWIIY,They cost more but are so worth it.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Good price,5
B00CBAWIIY,Great,5
B00CBAWIIY,"I use these frequently and love them. I have tried other brands for less expensive, but I always come back to these as they just work better!",5
B00CBAWIIY,Works great.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Great paper,5
B00CBAWIIY,Excellent value and looks great when completed,5
B00CBAWIIY,The durability of this product exceeds expectations! I will choose this any time over the industrial one we have at our school!,5
B00CBAWIIY,Great product. We frequently buy.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"I've used a few different types of laminators, and this one is hands down my favorite. I've only had it crinkle up a sheet one time out of the hundreds of sheets I've laminated, and that was only because I put it in really strangely. For reference, with other laminators I would have to be so careful about lining it up perfectly and making sure it went in at a 90 degree angle. You don't have to worry as much about that with this one, it can tolerate quite a bit of user error. It's also fairly quiet, although it has a moment of making some noise when heating up, and then after heating up if I don't put in the next sheet right after, but even with those noises it's quieter than other laminators I've used.When I laminate, I often cut up small pieces of paper to have them laminate separately (like for making paper dolls), and as long as I use the right kind of laminating sheet (i.e. one with enough static electricity to hold the laminating sheet closed) the tray works great for that. My biggest issue now is that I have bad laminating sheets, so loading it from the top can mean the pieces start to fall.",5
B00CBAWIIY,I know my work will turn out well with this.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"It heats up quickly and does nice work. Yes, I recommend it!",5
B00CBAWIIY,Works great,4
B00CBAWIIY,Product does the job,5
B00CBAWIIY,These are top quality and worth it!,5
B00CBAWIIY,This is exactly what I wanted. Product works great.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"Needed office supplies, No problems in the quality or price.",5
B00CBAWIIY,EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED,5
B00CBAWIIY,I used this to laminate my bookmarks made on watercolor paper.  I put them through twice and they came out beautifully!  I think the thickness of the paper required it.  So easy to use.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Feeds in the laminator with ease no jamming,5
B00CBAWIIY,These Laminating Pouches work perfectly with my Scotch Laminating Machine.  I will always stick with this brand.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Ours died so bought this to replace. Does the job so we're happy.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I like how compact the unit is and the storage box (with handle) that it is sold in.  I laminate multiple recipes within one letter-size laminate pouch which makes it a little tricky to perfectly line up the floppy pouch on the guide tray but the unit is set up to allow for angle adjustment midway through. Laminating a full sheet of letter paper is easy.  On rare occasions I had to pass card-stock items through twice to completely bond the plastic to the paper.  Tip: Work on putting items into the laminate pouches while the laminator heats up instead of before starting the unit since it takes several minutes to heat up.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"These are my go to. Most of the time I find them on Amazon cheaper than the store. I love the durability and clarity of the seal. They are the perfect size for a sheet of paper, so easy to use with my mini machine and protect my papers. They are awesome and I put my seal of approval on them.",5
B00CBAWIIY,Very easy to use.,4
B00CBAWIIY,"I have to say, I was somewhat concerned by the one star/no star reviews, most of which dealt with the laminator not working.  I purchased it nonetheless, and I am GLAD that I did!  Worked right out of the box, everything very simple to understand and operate.  My first project was to laminate recipe cards for my wife.  I put the recipes on 8 X 5 inch cards, and placed them 2 per laminate page (Fellowes Thermal Laminating Pouches, 5 mil thickness, and they work fine, with plenty of margin to completely seal the cards.  I did 59 pouches in a row (total of about 110 pouches done for the project) without a hitch (well, one hitch - I wasn't paying enough attention to the feed and it sent the pouch through at a slight angle, enough to run into the side and cause a bubble.  Good news though:  I immediately ran it through again (properly) and it ironed the bubbles out; that was the only hiccup in the operation, and that was MY fault, not the machines.  All in all, this is a splendid machine for home/light duty use.  I used a Fellowes Neutron Plus Rotary Paper Trimmer to trim off the pouch excess, leaving about 1/4 - 5/16ths inch pouch edge beyond the card.  The machine is very quiet, and I only have two niggles about it:  1) I would prefer to have the feeding guides a little higher; it's too easy to ""go off the rails"", although unless it's REALLY off, as in my error, it still works and feeds fine. That said, I recommend paying attention to straightening the pouch BEFORE the rollers catch it to prevent an angle feed.  2) I would have liked a slide out pouch support on the end of the feeder ramp - the Fellowes pouches have a good tacky surface that keeps everything in place, but I would have more piece of mind to have the unsealed end supported a bit more.  Other than that, I am pleased with the purchase and functionality of this machine!",5
B00CBAWIIY,These sheets provide firm lamination. Easy to use.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I love the laminating capacity. These sheets have no bubbles while going through the machine. The sheets are very durable. Compared to other sheets there is no jamming. It just goes through the machine very easily. Highly recommended.,5
B00CBAWIIY,I use these a lot in the classroom. To buy in bulk is a good deal.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"I purchased this to laminate some bingo cards that I created. It only took about five minutes to warm up. The machine worked well. There was no curling up. The laminator was sturdy and secure sitting on the counter top. It was quiet, barely made any noise at all. It also has a place to roll up the electrical cord at the bottom of the device, for easy storage.",5
B00CBAWIIY,My scotch laminator gives me consistent quality results. These pouches are no exception.,5
B00CBAWIIY,Item as described. Fast shipping. Good price.,5
B00CBAWIIY,"Nothing to dislike. Durable, great size, seals perfectly, no issues using with the laminator. Ordered 200 sheets don't think I'll need to reorder anytime soon but if I do I'm getting these again lol.",5
B00CBAWIIY,Once heated the feel thick and stay well,5
B00CBAWIIY,"Can't fault these for being sturdy. The only issue, if you can even call it that, is that even when the humidity is normal to high, paper clings to them, making it hard to position. Once it's in position, though, there's no stopping it. These are high quality. They don't bunch up in the laminator, even if I accidentally start it a wee bit crooked.",5
B00CBAWIIY,Heats quickly and does a great job,5
B00CBAWIIY,Great for teachers!,5
B00CBAWIIY,Paper seems to be thick compared to what is used at school.,4
B00CBAWIIY,I buy these over and over again... such great quality for all my work!,5
B00CBAWIIY,Very happy with this product,5
B00CBAWIIY,Good quality.Great for teachers.,5
B00CBAWIIY,excelente,5
B00CBAWIIY,works great for our small in home projects,5
B00CBAWIIY,This was a gift for elementary class,5
B00CBAWIIY,"My granddaughter, a kindergarten teacher, says these are just as good as the name brand at half the price.",5
B00CBAWIIY,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This machine works great for laminating documents and stuff. When you turn the machine on, it takes about 5 minutes to heat up before the Ready light turns on and you can use it. You place whatever you're laminating between the two plastic sheets, flatten as much as you can to get any air bubbles out, put the SEALED end of the sheet into the machine, and it'll automatically pull it in and laminate it. Couldn't be easier. I did maybe 15 documents and they all came out perfectly with no issues. The largest hassle is just getting the laminate sheet to separate to put the item you're laminating in it. The only thing that is kind of frustrating other than that is if you turn the machine off, even for a split second (I mean immediately off and back on), and realize you need to laminate something else, you have to wait the entire 5 minutes or so for it to heat back up even though it's still probably hot enough to do it. Guess there's no sensor to detect the temperature to tell it it's ready. Must just be a timed thing.  I do also wish the cord was longer. It's not very long. Probably around 3ft if I had to guess? So if you're needing to put it far away from an outlet, you may need an extension cord or something. Can't really tell until you get it. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend this machine if you're needing to laminate things.",5
B00CBAWIIY,Perfect fit,5
B00CBAWIIY,Muy buenas y de excelente calidad,5
B01BRGU8R0,"These scissors are a fantastic value and affordable price point. The comfort grip handles make them easy to use for extended periods,(even for my smaller than average hands) and the PVD-coated stainless steel blades cut through paper, fabric, and even light cardboard effortlessly. The build feels sturdy, and the sleek grey design adds a professional touch. Perfect for home, office, or crafting needs. Highly recommended for anyone looking for reliable, budget-friendly scissors!",5
B01BRGU8R0,"I needed a pair of scissors that become a daily household tool.  It should always be handy, ready to be used to open boxes, letters, or to cut something like wrapping paper without fail.

It's a well-made item at a good price.",5

Would buy again if needed.",4

The handles are certainly extremely easy to grasp, especially when you are forced into an unusual angle. But by far, it's the cutting ability is it's best feature. So far nothing I've needed to cut was too difficult for these blades. Simply MARVELOUS!",5

B01BRGU8R0,"As usual, Amazon Basics sells a great product - in this case scissors - at a great price. 3 pair of scissors, each with different colored grips. I have big hands; they're not a great fit, but they're larger than most household scissors. This is the third set I have purchased, after being very pleased with the first set I purchased about 4 years ago (the original set is still in great shape, the other sets have been for my office and now for a second home).",5
B01BRGU8R0,"I've always had scissors in the house.  My family knew where to replace them if they borrowed them.  Then, one day, someone did not replace them and I was lost.  I ordered these and I have come to depend on these  for different things.  I use these to open my mail.  I use these to open some of my Amazon deliveries.  Actually, I use these scissors for just about everything.  They are sharp enough.  I would recommend them -- I think that they are terrific.",5
B01BRGU8R0,"Cheap, but effective scissors with a smooth feel to them when cutting things.",5

B01BRGU8R0,"One thing that annoys me in a 1st world problem kind of way is related to scissors. When I can't find a pair, and when I do, they have a notch in them from cutting something that damaged them. So, yeah, that's two things...but scissors are the topic!What better way to solve for X than to have 3 pair of scissors that are different colors, so that I can have ""my"" pair of scissors, my wife can have the other two; where she can use them as a screwdriver or whatever, and mine see only paper.Amazon, solving problems without counseling.",4
B01BRGU8R0,These scissors are the BEST for adults. I have bought multiple packs now for our household scissors. They work on office items and kitchen items. The grip material is good. They are easy to open and close for quick cutting.,5

B01BRGU8R0,"I have bought these before, and they are still excellent ""desk scissors"" or ""kitchen scissors"" for utility work; I don't think they would work well for sewing, though.  The people who sew (and there are many in my family and my wife's family) are VERY picky about their sewing scissors, and most keep their ""sewing scissors"" either hidden or locked up, so that only THEY may use them.  However, these Amazon Basics scissors are great utility scissors and, when they wear out, may be recycled and replaced with new purchases of Amazon Basics scissors, maybe every five or six years.",5

B001IKES5O,"Dries quickly, great price",5
B001IKES5O,"I bought this product because I saw a bunch of creators use this to seal not only their paintings, but also clay creations. I used this on a couple of my paintings, and at first, it did amazing, (other than my idiot self touching the painting accidentally and ruining it, but that's my error, not the sealers) but then I used it on my water color paintings. Thinking back now, it's a water based sealer so duh it'll reactivate the water color, but I had watched a bunch of creators use it on water color paintings and I thought it would be fine. I'm not sure how they did it without the end result ending like mine, but I was not lucky - literally so many of my favorite paintings got smudged and ruined. I've highlighted the areas that got smudged on my paintings. The only one that was fine was completely colored pencil. So from now on I'll only use this on either acrylic or colored pencil, never water color. It's just sad because I mainly use water color as my medium, and I bought this to seal them, but now I can't.But other than that disaster, it dried fast and easy, and applying it only took a paintbrush. One other difficult thing is holding the object while sealing it, because you have to turn it to seal all of it - which can be tricky and if you're not careful, it'll ruin your painting/clay object (which is shown on my painting of the trees/night sky where I accidentally touched it and ruined my painting).",4

Also, Mod Podge Rocks, their website, has tons of vids and a blog full of idead or tips to best use their product.  This purchase was the cheapest I've found Mod Podge, even with a coupon at the craft supply store! I'll definitely be buying it here from now on, esp where I go through a lot of it!  I also like that the Matte finish Mod Podge doesn't have the same smell the gloss does (which when dry, you don't notice it at all), the matte finish actually has no smell at all really. And I love that you can mix literally anything in it that you paint on. I've mixed it with acrylic paint, chalk paint, and even my own handmade chalk paint and it still works AMAZING. I've also mixed it with different mediums like glitter, glass glitter, cinnamon and coffee, lol, you name it, I've mixed it. I love working with this stuff and highly recommend it over any other brand or making your own with the glue. Using school glue with a little water like some tutorials show will not seal your projects, it also turns yellow and if you mix other things in with it, it will crack over time... Trust me, I've tried them all! Mod podge is the only thing that seals, protects and is workable with added mediums and won't later fall apart or turn unintended colors!",5
B001IKES5O,I keep this item handy; it is very easy to use and can be used for many crafts & arts projects. All ages friendly.,4
B001IKES5O,"As always, Mod Podge is a great product..have used it for years on craft projects...",5
B001IKES5O,Love this stuff for my crafting!Tk u sincerely,5
B001IKES5O,I'm glad the mod podge has a seal cuz if it didn't it would've spilled everywhere and on everywhere. Everything was shipped loosely but I really shouldn't be surprised since it is Amazon packaging and all-Besides that the product itself worked great I'm using it as a sealant for my shrinky dink charms and the finish looks great,4
B001IKES5O,"We had 3 puzzles to glue and seal. As we were the first timers with the puzzles, we had no idea what to use. Then, we took the advice from here and this Matt finish Mod Pudge was the winner.Wow, unless you get really lazy,like I did, pouring the glue, directly onto the puzzle and spread it, it will take about 10 min. or less to cover 500-1000 piece puzzles, then, without waiting further, I applied again another coat. And, I remembered to lift the puzzle to see any glue smeared unto the poster board. It did here and there and I gently roll down the board off the puzzle edges. That helped to separate the hardening puzzles from get stuck to the board. within 20-30min. I could even lift 500 piece puzzle(18x24in)After only 2-3 hours in the room temperature, it sets beautifully. And, I turned them over and gave a thin coat onto the back. The backside is often uncoated brown paper material, and they dried even faster.We still have 1/4 out of 16fl oz bottle, using 3 coats each(1 @ 20x27, 2 @ 18x24)The matt finish really gives it a more of a collection quality look than the glossy would.(getting the right size brush)__________________The only thing I would suggest, is the sponge brush size, I bought two brushes of a differnt width. One is too big for the bottle opening. I would suggest getting a brush,  smaller than 1.75inch(45mm) or you will have some mess around the bottle while working with it. They are only 30-65 cents. And, I was stingy enough(no, environmentally conscious)to wash it later to save it. And, the glues washes off really nice, leaving no residue.My verdict is, I am glad to find some quality product, that is very versatile and easy to work with. I will become a new fan of Mod Pudge- except that I am not keen on just an ugly cheap label design from early 70s. The local store priced it at $8.99 plus tax.",5
B001IKES5O,I often create arts and crafts that I want to seal with a sealer. I found this glue sealer and decided to give it a shot. It is amazing and dries very quickly! The smell is kind of strong but once it dries it does not smell anymore. Great price for a big bottle! Good for a lot of surfaces! I used it to seal the paint on rubber ducks I painted on and it works great on them :) I definitely recommend!,5
B001IKES5O,"We've used an off-brand one that ended up showing residuals, so we hesitated when purchasing this. However, it did not disappoint! I'd recommend it!",5
B001IKES5O,Bought this for doing napkin decoupage. Works great!  Recommend applying 2 or 3  lighter instead of one heavy coat.,5
B001IKES5O,"We use this product to seal terracotta pots prior to painting. It has worked well for us for this purpose, and we like that it is not toxic to us or the plants. Nice product for the price and it's multiple uses.",5
B001IKES5O,All crafters need some Mod Podge at some point.Tried and true.,5
B001IKES5O,content with purchase. worked great for a salt dough project with my grandson.,5
B001IKES5O,"Got the larger bottle on sale for cheaper than regular school glue.  So that was a plus.  Don't forget to wash your paint brushes out after use when applying product, will harden them up and nothing I've tried will get it off,  including 90% rubbing alcohol.  Dries clear and matte.  Works good for crafts.",4
B001IKES5O,Great,5
B001IKES5O,This gives a clear coat coverage to my jigsaw puzzle.,5
B001IKES5O,"I used to stick faux leather to wood and it worked really well! The item got here really fast secure with no leaks, if you follow instructions it will dry well, doesn't smell too much, it's a little more thick than Elmer's glue for sure, but easy to clean.",5
B001IKES5O,Quality and value so worth it!!!,5
B001IKES5O,"This is a trusted craft product, I will purchase it again",5
B001IKES5O,works great.,5
B001IKES5O,Great,5
B001IKES5O,Much better that the small bottles from the Dollar store!,5
B001IKES5O,Worked Well,5
B001IKES5O,Good non toxic glue,4
B001IKES5O,Would not call an all-in-one solution. Niche application only. Poor glue. Decent exterior coating. Decent sealer.,3
B001IKES5O,"My order included a 16 oz bottle of Mod Podge (white glue).  When it arrived the bottle was missing the screw top.  Luckily the foil cover on the bottle prevented leakage, but I cannot open and reseal the bottle without the screw top.",3
B001IKES5O,It was on sale.Good price for the size.Using it for puzzles.,4
B001IKES5O,"I use this glue mainly to glue my puzzles. At first when put on I thought it wasn't going to work. It does work. The size is decent. Drying time is quick. Very easy to use. When I use it I normally spread it over the puzzle then wipe with a paper towel. Or use it with a small sponge brush. I would recommend and definitely buy again. Keep your eye out, the price fluctuates sometimes. Depending on the price, it appears to be a real bargain at times.",5
B001IKES5O,Saw a cool video on facebook - how to make a jute rope bowl with mod podge!! It was fun and easy and my cat loved the bowl!! I have already made 3 bowls and a container for my long and tall utensils... mod podge has been around forever - love creative new uses for it!!,5
B001IKES5O,I use this to glue together all of my puzzles. It holds them together well but the application of it is a little bit difficult because you have to get it between all the pieces. It leaves no color after it dries and the images of the puzzles are always great. Definitely my go to puzzle glue.,5
B001IKES5O,"I use this product a lot in my art studio, it has never disappointed me.",5
B001IKES5O,Worked great on our puzzle; very easy to use.,5
B001IKES5O,"This glue by Mod Podge is perfect to seal puzzles. I recently completed a complicated wooden one that had very small pieces and once completed I was determined to keep it together. When I received this glue (which arrived one day after ordering....thanks Amazon), I placed a piece of wax paper underneath the puzzle and covered with a coat of glue. Once it dried (a few hours later), it resulted in a clear, matte finish. I added another layer to the back.  Overall, I am extremely pleased and know that I will be using this product on other crafts.",5
B001IKES5O,This product works perfectly. I use it to stiff up puzzles I do,4
B001IKES5O,As expected,4
B001IKES5O,Nice,5
B001IKES5O,"I thought they were bigger,  but it's okay.",5

It kept my clay securely in place as I kneaded and molded, ensuring greater control and accuracy in my designs.Clear Markings and Gridlines:The clear markings and gridlines on the mat were a lifesaver for my clay projects. They made it super easy to measure and cut with precision, resulting in neat and professional-looking creations.Easy to Clean:Cleaning the mat was a breeze.

I highly recommend the anezus Self Healing Sewing Mat, not just for sewing, but for all your clay crafting needs. It's an investment you won't regret",5
B088M48Z3G,The color is nice. The quality is good. It is scratch resistant. You can go over the guidelines frequently without obliterating them. You can do many many many cuts and still have a good workable surface great product.,5
B088M48Z3G,This mat is nice and firm making it easy to handle and use.  The only minus is that I would have liked it to be a bit thicker.  It was a great buy at a low price!,5
B088M48Z3G,"I think the biggest thing to note is that this is NOT a self-healing mat (which are flexible and made of semi-soft thermoplastics that expand into cuts to fill the space). This is just a rigid cutting mat, and cut marks stay very obvious. That said, for what it IS, it does the job well enough.",4
B088M48Z3G,"This mat is fantastic for my sewing and crafting needs. It is made of durable and flexible material. The self healing feature keeps it smooth after repeated use. The 18""x12"" size is perfect for many of my crafting projects. It is a quality mat, making it well worth the cost.  Highly recommend for anyone needing a quality mat.",5
B088M48Z3G,"I ordered the mat so i would not have to cardboard any more, it heals most cut as you make them and is easy to clean if, like me, you will have a byte to eat as you are working on you craft/hobby. it has a good solid weight( less likely to shift while cutting).  it has to sides and one is just a standard grid pattern the other has a useful set of use full shapes and angles. ( that can help, if you find yourself w/out such tools) Only down side was the smell of it when i opened the package. it smelled strongly of heavy duty paint stripper, how ever it did not last long ( i left it on the porch to air out, and it was fine in a few minuets ).Pro's : size and price were right on the money : solid feel and construction : easy to clean and store when no longer neededCon's : the smell was off putting to say the least( it did not last long however)",5
B088M48Z3G,I've already used it a few times with my exacto knife trimming things and I haven't noticed the cuts I made in it at all. I like all of the measurements on it too. Very helpful. My main focal point in my pic was my skulls that I made but this mat is on my workable so I can review both at once. :),5
B088M48Z3G,The color is easy on the eyes. I use it as a under mat while repairing fountain pens. Great value.,5
B088M48Z3G,"I accidentally bought the biggest one, but when I got it and have now used it for 15~ gunpla kits, it's well worth it. You don't even need to ask yourself if it's worth it, at this price it's a must buy for me.",5
B088M48Z3G,"I thought the grid would go to 12 x 18 inches, but it's 11x17. It's actual size is accurate as stated. 4 stars instead of three because I should have paid better attention. I will keep the mat, it is worth the price.",4
B088M48Z3G,I am amazed how this product works. I use it to cut projects using an exacto knife. It leave no traces on the mat.,5
B088M48Z3G,I bought this mat for crafting and to protect the table I am working on. Great size. Just what I wanted. Good price.,5
B088M48Z3G,"The pad itself is a little thinner than I had hoped but I was pleasantly surprised by all the different measurement options were available! Degrees, circles, triangles, ovals, radius, etc. are all marked on pad. That will make it a lot more useful than I thought!",5
B088M48Z3G,Works just as advertised.  Get the larger size.  Easily stores in a cabinet and the larger size is more useful.  Cuts repair well.,4
B088M48Z3G,Love this mat.  It is smaller and is perfect for squaring quilt blocks and for crafts.  Thank you,5
B088M48Z3G,Perfect size for small projects,5
B088M48Z3G,Durable and useful in blanket making!,5
B088M48Z3G,This sewing mat will help me trim the quilting pieces without me getting the larger mat our of the closet.,5

B088M48Z3G,"Purchased the pad as a portable pad to use when participating in build days with the local hobby club. Small enough to use, yet large enough to be effective for most model scales.",4
B088M48Z3G,Everything was exactly what I needed. It all was used for a school project.,5
B088M48Z3G,"Aside from the time reference, above, I got what I wanted. A good self-healing mat for cutting at my desk. Its appearance was a bit different than I expected, but nothing to complain about. I got what I wanted. I like when that happens",4
B088M48Z3G,Great value easy to use.  Small for some projects but would recommend,5
B088M48Z3G,I is double sided and fairly thick. Lays nice and flat.,5

B088M48Z3G,seems nice required for college class,4
B088M48Z3G,Perfect mat for my little paint spot! Works great!,5
B088M48Z3G,"Right size for my desk,easy to see parts when i'm building.",5
B088M48Z3G,I do a lot of different things that I work on at the table so it helps,4
B088M48Z3G,"This self-healing craft/cutting mat is a great size for a small crafting table. It was shipped flat, and in great condition.",5
B088M48Z3G,Nice sturdy Matt for craft cutting at a very reasonable price,5
B088M48Z3G,Originally bought this for my daughter to use for her crafts she likes to make. Had to order another for her father!,5
B088M48Z3G,"I had a craft mat, but this is better size!!  My mats are self healing, which I love!",5
B088M48Z3G,"This has worked great for cutting. Just like it describes. I also learned that water based markers wipe right off of it, even after a few days. I loved it so much I decided to buy two more sizes.",5
B088M48Z3G,"Wanted one of these for a long time, and this works perfectly.",5
B088M48Z3G,How in the world I have gone still these years without this!! Exactly what it says it is and is great for fabric or crafts!!,5
B088M48Z3G,Good,5
B088M48Z3G,Great work mat. The lines are very visible and the durability is decent.,4
B088M48Z3G,I like the markings on both sides,4
B088M48Z3G,"A great size for all sorts of projects. However, its worst enemy is adhesive, so he careful or it will be ruined forever.",4
B088M48Z3G,Gift was well received and was exactly what he wanted.  Thanks.,5
B088M48Z3G,"This mat is thick, rigid enough, and feels like a quality mat.",5
B088M48Z3G,It can be used for a variety of things with the circut. I like how easy it is for the vinyl and cuts in general.,5
B088M48Z3G,I gave it 4 stars because i appreciate the price. It doesnt really self heal like my old one. The blade puts scores in it and you can feel it. But i like the price,4
B088M48Z3G,"A3 sizing is actually ""11.7 inches x 16.5 inches"" - in the headline this item is marketed as ""12 inches by 18 inches"". Otherwise it is a good, sturdy product for the price.",5
B088M48Z3G,"I've been wanting a good size mat for when I'm work with craft knives. Nice quality, very durable.",5
B088M48Z3G,"very detailed mat I'm sure it will come in handy but, I havent used it yet",5
B088M48Z3G,"Price was right, my last mat was Fiskers, won't buy that again-!",4
B088M48Z3G,Was so looking forward to using this for the first time. but the nasty chemical stench filled my room once removed from the cellophane wrapper ! It was giving me a headache so I placed it outside on my porch with hope the chemical odor will vanish once aired out.,4
B088M48Z3G,it works would buy again,4
B088M48Z3G,it's the perfect size for using table top in front of my tv. Seems to be a quality product,4
B088M48Z3G,"Making a quilt, cutting fabric",5
B088M48Z3G,Ok,5
B088M48Z3G,"I like the size, 12"" x 18"", which suits my needs and workspace. The green shade is also appealing to the eyes and easy to see the charts.",5
B088M48Z3G,"I wouldn't exactly call this a self healing slicing mat, but it's great for what it's for. I thought it was a little small at first, but it's actually a perfect size fit for what I need it for. Cutting with a knife is smooth as butter. 5 stars.",5
B088M48Z3G,I'm using this to protect my desk as I create cards and small multimedia paintings.,5
B088M48Z3G,Nice product for modeling purposes.,5
B088M48Z3G,"My daughter uses this for paper sloyd, and though it is still around and working, it is not very self healing. It has lines and scratches all over from the sloyd knives, and will not lay flat. It came in the mail warped, and we had hoped that it would flatten, but it did not. Not a great product.",3
B088M48Z3G,This cutting mat was built to last The thickness is nice it's easy to clean I like the extra numbers on there I'm able to measure my vinyl I like the color green so it's perfect It doesn't slide all over the place when cutting vinyl easy to use,5
B088M48Z3G,"The mat works perfect for cutting paper or plastics above it. I tested and the cuts really self heal. Make sure not to get this mat warm, or else it will deform.",4
B088M48Z3G,"Still Smells weird, rim is ever so slightly warped on both of the 2 of these I bought but servicable",3
B088M48Z3G,It's small but effective.,5
B088M48Z3G,"I used it to cut vinyl tile on, worked great!",5
B088M48Z3G,I like the many options for cutting with the designs,5
B088M48Z3G,Good product. Would buy again.,5
B088M48Z3G,Seems to work good. The self healing does work.,5
B088M48Z3G,I have read many reviews on different mats before I chose this brand.  The cutting surface is great.  My fabric and ribbon did not stick to the surface. The thickness of the board is perfect  This product did not have a smell to it.  I love this board.  I will purchase a bigger one in the future!,5
B088M48Z3G,"I've been wanting one of these for a while. The size is just right for my small(ish) workbench. It's easy to keep the mat clean and the odd knife cut doesn't mess it up too much. Time will tell how durable it is, but for now it's doing its job perfectly.",5
B088M48Z3G,I use mine to cut mockups with an X-Acto knife. My old mat was wearing pretty bad so this was a nice upgrade. No issues so far.,5
B001A42CTW,"I am satisfied with the knife.  It has a good design with beefy handle and soft rubber sleeve to help with precision work.  The knife holder is well designed and can hold the knife blade in place securely.  Like others pointed out the knife comes with a cap to protect the blade and from accidently cut yourself.  Its a bit loose but can hold itself in place.  Some 1-star reviewer does not know how to put the blade in correctly.  let me tell you.. look carefully at the knife, the holder consists of two metal wedges with a leaf spring inside.  On each of the metal wedges there is a channel where you are supposed to put the blade in.  Only on one of the wedge that has a notch, the notch should be aligned with the round holder to prevent it from twisting, and the blade edge should be aligned with this notch too.  Once you screw it in the handle tightly (with a pair of pliers) everything would be locked in place securely.  Look at other pictures posted.  There is no way the blade can flip back and forth if you do it right.",5
B001A42CTW,Definitely an improvement over the standard X-Acto knife. It is over 7/16 in diameter! A much better fit in my hands. The larger #2 X-Acto blades do not fit. The #11 blade will fit in two different orientations. Insert the #11 blade in a different orientation and it will go much deeper into the knife and give you a shorter blade with better leverage!See the picture with the tip of the blade just barely sticking out. I like the control this gives me. Not so much blade sticking out and bending left and right.,5
B001A42CTW,"I whittle every single day. The thought of going back to screw-type blade holders is chilling. I change blades multiple times in any given project and these are quick and easy. Pull out and down on the back to release the blade, pop in a new one and you are ready to go while the creative juices are still flowing. They are plastic and not nearly as strong as the aluminum tubes that make up the other types of craft knives. But they are very affordable. Until an improvement comes along, I get what I pay for and am extremely satisfied.",5
B001A42CTW,Fiskars products are all high quality. Love their garden tools. Unit is very well made and comes with one blade.No instructions that are useful - be sure to practice removing and fitting the blade.,4
B001A42CTW,"I've been trying to find a nice exacto blade handle with little luck, but this is the perfect fit. Nice solidly built metal handle, with a really good feeling grip section. Also for just $6 it's a steal.I will say caution when inserting a blade, if you don't get it in just right, and tight it can come out even when tightened, so just a bit of required caution.",5
B001A42CTW,"This tool has proven to be incredibly beneficial for me due to its lightweight design and precise cutting abilities. Its sharp edge demands caution, so it's essential to store it safely away from children. Overall, it performs exceptionally well!",5
B001A42CTW,"It was disconcerting when the blade slipped out while I was using the knife. Sharp as expected though, and then some. So just be certain the blade is well seated and secure. Given there are no safety mechanisms at all, and your fingers will likely be close to the blade, you should check the blade seating often. Because it could be very easy to loosen the blade accidentally, 4 stars.",4
B001A42CTW,Sharp! Great quality! A must have in your garage/ office and you will need it one day for sure!,5
B001A42CTW,Good quality instrument.,5
B001A42CTW,"I bought this for punk stenciling. I've never used fiskars for a knife brand, only for their scissors and rotary cutters. Somethign tells me the blade should not be this lose, but for all I know it is probably something I did when fiddling with it after opening the package. Very sharp, watch your fingers, and always use close toed shoes when using craft knives. Trust me from experience years ago it hurts to step on these.",5
B001A42CTW,I needed a better pen knife for my leather crafting. Sometimes I have to cut through thick leather and having a wider pen with a soft rubber grip helps a lot. It's much more comfortable.Really good value and the blade it came with was nice and sharp,5
B001A42CTW,"Sharp, good box. Not much to it, glad they work the same as the one that came with the tool.",4
B001A42CTW,Perfect for opening packages & boxes. I ended up buying more.,5
B001A42CTW,Very sharp to cut plastic models knives. Stay sharp a long time,5
B001A42CTW,Keep away from the kids-great service for what I needed.,5
B001A42CTW,Quality brand item at low price.,5
B001A42CTW,"Worked great for the project I needed it for, easy to grip and had no issues using it.",5
B001A42CTW,Great tool to have!,5
B001A42CTW,Way too easy for the blade to come out. But comfortable pen grip and width.,4
B001A42CTW,"Only issue i found is the blade does not have a cover or way to retract, so you always have an exposed razor blade.",4
B001A42CTW,"I needed a handle that would fit blades containing a 3/8"" shank.  This handle is meant for 1/4""/6mm blades. My mistake for not looking into this further; however instead of just saying which blades it fits; it would have been nice to have this detail listed as well. It seems to be a good quality handle however and I will be keeping it.",4
B001A42CTW,Got this brand because of a youtuber review. Good craft knife.,5
B001A42CTW,"I have trouble keeping the blade tight. It seems to want to bend. Very sharp and works ok with very thin material, but tends to want to curve. Frankly, I expected more from the brand.",3
B001A42CTW,works ad described,4
B001A42CTW,Tried several cheap knockoffs. Silly me. Go with Fiskars. The best.,5
B001A42CTW,I have to say that finally walking away from my barrel exacto knife feels really good. Especially with this new tool it just conforms to your hand it helps you have more control and the technology on holding the blade is excellent. I no longer have to worry about a blade wiggling while cutting or completely sliding out. I highly recommend this tool.,5
B001A42CTW,"Nice, comfortable diameter.  Much easier to hold/operate than the stock size knife.",4
B001A42CTW,The size and comfort grip is the best part of this tool. I'll never go back to the regular kind. Worth the price.,5
B001A42CTW,"It's sub par at all the things. The handle doesn't securely hold the blade causing it to come loose when cutting. The blade itself was sharp...for about 5 cuts, on craft foam. Then between the dull blade snagging and tearing the work, the blade won't stay put. Sub. Par.",3
B001A42CTW,"As great as it was it only cuts through one layer of t-shirt fabric. Two layers, normal thin cotton, creates a jagged hell.",4
B001A42CTW,"It works pretty good, and when gripping the handle you are not working the tightening mechanism loose. BUT- The locking/latching mechanism at the back end is loose and sloppy and not a firm positive lock when fully locked in place. It's probably poor Chinese manufacturing that has too large of a tolerance at the interface but it does not meet the expected Fiskars quality standard.",3
B001A42CTW,"I use this to clean up nubs after cutting pieces out of gates. Its been through 5 kits and still going strong. Build quality is great, sharp and hasnt dulled much from cutting plastic, but i dont love that the back of the blade is sharp too.",5
B001A42CTW,"i use this pretty much every day. very fine point, able to untwist and adjust length of blade as well.",5
B001A42CTW,"I bought this product so I could do some detail work with EVA foam. It worked so well I ended up using it for numerous other art projects too. I snapping the blade trying to use it as a prying tool, a blunder on my behalf but I must say replacement blades are relatively cheap and easy to install. I can't suggest this product enough if you need a precision cutting tool!",5
B001A42CTW,got this one to dedicate to cutting suckers off my African violets (if you know you know). APpreciate that it has a cap for storage.,5
B001A42CTW,"The chuck won't stay screwed tight; therefore, the blade falls out!",3
B001A42CTW,durabile,4
B001A42CTW,The holding head made of lead has a production error that prevented the knife to be fixated properly.I still gave three stars because I was able to correct it with a metal saw.,3
B001A42CTW,I purchased this to help with cutting the foil off of the Nespresso vertuo pods so I can reuse them and it was exactly what I needed. The grip is nice but downside is it only came with one blade. You have to tighten the blade though or else it might fall out easily. It cuts very clean and serves its purpose.,4
B001A42CTW,The replacements are sharp and as described. Great seller and fast deliverey.,5
B001A42CTW,"And, tis is the one that I decided to keep sitting next to my workstation. It's comfortable in my hand and that's really all there is to a knife like this.",5
B001A42CTW,"Easy to hold, maneuver and safely store.Cut through wall paper as well as cardboard with ease and safety.Stays sharp after multiple usage.",5
B001A42CTW,"I know X-Acto makes several different models, but I imagine most of us have used the standard #1 knife at some point. You know, the straight aluminum handle with knurled grip that twists to secure the blade. Mine would always loosen, leaving blades stuck in whatever I was working on. And the cap never stayed on. You'd think, after how many years, they could figure out a good plastic cap. Well, Fiskars figured it out. They figured it all out. The handle of this knife is a little thicker and heavier, and has a rubber grippy part that makes it nicer to hold. The twist collet seems tighter, able to hold the blade better. And THE CAP STAYS ON! This is my new favorite hobby knife.",5
B001A42CTW,"My experience could be totally anmalous, or not.  Mine arrived without a blade in it.  (It's only supposed to come with one.)  I had to cut the package open to use it, expecting there to be a blade somewhere inside, but, no blade anywhere.  I had to provide a little more evidence and external packaging than usual to return an Amazon product, but the company accepted it without a hassle.  Two stars rather than one because if it arrived intact, it looked like a good tool and the price was good, and the return was accepted graciously, but mine was unusable.",2
B001A42CTW,"It's comfortable to use, but doesn't hold on to a #11 blade without over-tightening.",3
B001A42CTW,If using this knife for plastic model building it's perfect and the build quality is great. But the problem I have is the blade doesn't lock in good enough it can be tight one minute and loose the next becoming a issue.,3
B001A42CTW,Item as described!,5
B001A42CTW,"Unless you plan to use exclusively the blades produced by Fiskar, you don't want this poorly designed blade handle.  It does NOT work with #11 blades (the industry standard).  It will not tighten fully on the blade and you can't get tight enough without some very unsafe practices (ie putting your fingers on the blade while applying force.  It's amazing that this handle has been on the market for so long when it is absolutely dangerous and not worth the money.  It looks pretty and feels good in the hand, but if it can't accept industry standard blades and have an easy to use and reliable tightening mechanism, it's not worth having in your tool kit.",2
B001A42CTW,Great exacto knike. I like the large diameter of it and the rubber grip is excellent.,5
B001A42CTW,The weight and grip for this holder are perfect for the avid artist/crafter! Also the cap is not useless like most others. I don't regret this purchase one bit.,5
B001A42CTW,Sharp and precise.,5
B001A42CTW,"Great product,  easy to hold with the great design.  Perfectly sharp, and smart lid to protect the blade.  Highly recommend  !",5
B001A42CTW,Good product,4
B001A42CTW,I am happy with my purchase,5
B001A42CTW,"I like how this feels in the hand and it's much nicer than the standard metal knurled Xacto brand one but the blade wiggles when fully tightened. I tried pulling it out, pushing it all the way in, really cranking on it but it always wiggles slightly. For some, this may not be an issue but the whole point of having a precision blade is for precision work and the wiggle throws me off. It's really not much but I expect my blade to be... well held by a blade holder. I'm using name brand blades as well.",2
B001A42CTW,I like the ease of use and ability to trim in narrow spots.  The handle is comfortable. It's made very well and the price is good.,5
B001A42CTW,I have large hands and find a lot of Exacto knives are too thin. This feels nice when using.,5
B001A42CTW,Worked well for what I needed.,4
B001A42CTW,"Ordering a second today .. its pretty perfect, the only improvement would be to retract the blade",5
B001A42CTW,Nice handle grip. Sharp blade. Love.,5
B001A42CTW,"I liked this knife so much that I bought another one so I didn't have to change between my two favorite blade styles so often. I like the comfort and feel. I don't often use the blade cover, but when I do, it snaps on and holds securely. For the cost, I am very happy with the knives. I use them for fine detail on my wood carvings.",5
B001A42CTW,Good for Hobby Projects. Very sharp. Keep away from Children!,5
B001A42CTW,I like that I know it's there. Not like the light aluminum or plastic options I'm familiar with.,5
B001A42CTW,Works as it should. The knife is exactly like the photo.,5
B001A42CTW,"This is an excellent craft/hobby knife. I make scale models of aircraft and armor and have tested just about every hobby knife on the market. This Fiskar's is one of my two favorites. The die cast metal body feels solid and weighty in the hand, not cheap and flimsy like so many others. The mechanism that holds the blade is also a die cast metal that has been nicely finished with no rough spots. The orange rubber grip has a secure feel to it, even with sweaty hands. The blades lock in tightly with no wiggle or slop in them at all. This is particularly nice for scraping seams, where you run the knife blade perpendicular to the mold line and scrape the plastic with the back of the  blade. Another thing worth mentioning is that I only use scalpel blades for modeling because they're much thinner. Many hobby knives are too narrow to hold a scalpel blade, but the Fiskar's works beautifully with them. One thing that I would love to see is an anti-rolling feature. The other hobby knife that I swear by is the Olfa Cushion Grip which has a little rectangular piece of plastic that sticks out from the back of the handle to keep the knife from rolling off the table. It is an excellent feature.All said and done, I love this knife. It checks every box for me and it will always have a place in my tool kit. Very highly recommended.",5
B001A42CTW,"The thicker handle on this tool, combined with the soft grip section, is much more comfortable than the cheaper exacto knife handles.",5
B001A42CTW,"I bought this for leatherworking. I found it to be comfortable to use and extremely sharp. I use this as a companion to the OLFA 9mm snap knife, the snap knife for long straight cuts and this Fiskar knife for intricate curves. I recommend keeping both knives handy.",5
B001A42CTW,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Highly recommend this product to anyone in need of a reliable and accurate tool,4
B001A42CTW,"I'm still on the lookout for a thicker grip knife for cutting leather. But it a lot better than the cheaper ones on here. Fishers is one of my favorite brands and may of my leather cutting tools are from them. They last a long time, and haven't found anything better on the market yet.",5
B001A42CTW,Thanks,4
B001A42CTW,Does what I needed and arrived in new condition,5
B001A42CTW,"I love this for weeding vinyl. I have a sticker business and I cut and weed a lot of stickers. My hand often gets sore, but this helps a lot! The grip is very comfortable, unlike others. The blade is extremely sharp. It comes with a safety clear case for storage. It feels comfortable in my hand. I highly recommend!",5
B001A42CTW,"This feels like a lovely instrument and the blade is pretty sharp. If only it would stay in! The moment I took the knife out of its packaging and plastic guard, the blade fell out! The packaging had no instructions on how to replace the blade. A blurb on the Amazon page said to turn the metal collar. This proved impossible to do as I understood it from the photo. After a lengthy search for videos that actually covered how to change the blade to this knife as opposed to the easy change one, I finally found instructions on Fiskar's site, in a reply to another customer who had the same issue of blade not staying in. I followed the instructions and no matter how tight I tighten it, the blade shifts and slips when I'm cutting. So, lots of good materials and a sharp blade, but for usability, the item I received is an utter piece of garbage.",1
B001A42CTW,"The hobby knife is a great product, it has a good balance and weight to it, however this knife is for the advanced person due to the way you need to change the blade. It is way different from other hobby knives, if you take a closer look, you'll see a small pin that is wedged in place on the top or tip of the hobby knife.(look at the picture with the arrow to get a better understanding)To change the blade you will need to unscrew the entire top part. Once it's unscrewed, with your thumb and your index finger, grab the base at the top, above the rubber grip pad, make sure YOU DO NOT TUCH THE BLADE AS IT'S SUPER SHARP.  On a hard surface, push down on it, as the blade will be released, at this point the blade will become loose and you can exchange. They way it's designed is for stronger use of it. Just be careful of the spring not to come out when replacing the blade, if it does come out,  just place it back in, then replace the blade. The last thing is just to reverse the steps and tighten the top piece.Hope this helps you out when you purchase this hobby knife.",5
B001A42CTW,"Blade slips out during use.  Tried to tighten in handle but does not work.  Did not come with instructions on package.  Blade is sharp and cuts well but product is not safe to use, would not recommend this.",2
B001A42CTW,"Okay, it's just a craft knife. But it delivers value for the modest price. Blades lock in solidly and the grippy zone is helpful with cutting accuracy.",5
B001A42CTW,The plastic cap that should be there for safety is unsafe.  It does not stay on securely and it is not the quality I have come to expect from Fiskars.,4
B001A42CTW,I would buy this again! I have used it for several different projects and it worked well without getting dull immediately. It goes through foam core board nicely and cardstock is breeze!,5
B001A42CTW,"Excellent quality and value, feels solid and very comfortable!",5
B001A42CTW,"These knives, often called X-Acto knives (which is another brand but a commonly used name) are pretty much all the same. Except, when you can find one that has a grip like this that is easier on your hand.This one is a breeze to use and is much more comfortable than anything else out there. I won't use anything else now that I have found this.",5
B001A42CTW,I use it mainly for opening letters and breaking down boxes.,5
B001A42CTW,Sharp,5
B001A42CTW,Enough said...good craft knife,4
B019CSHSW8,"DISLIKES: Recharge time, to recharge after a good usage of the tool requires 5 hours to a full charge before you can get working again, that is with the default adapter{charger) that comes with it, which is 6V 400mA.This also depends on the amperage of your charger, I have found chargers with a 2Amp up to 5Amp charge things faster, and can cut your recharge cycle down quite a bit, 2 Amp usually about 2-1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, a 5 Amp charger can reduce this down to anywhere from 30 minutes, to not usually more than 2 hours{if that} for a full recharge.  I have numerous adapters with a wide variety of voltages and ratings, always USE a charger/adapter with the correct voltage, in this case 6V, but the amperage is what makes the difference in how fast it will recharge.LIKES:Rechargeable, cuts through many different materials smoothly and easily.  Self Sharpening blade, so longer use of the cutting blade before having to possibly replace the circular blade.I wouldn't actually call this tool electric scissors, it's more like a sub-miniature hand-held circular saw.  I purchased this tool initially for cutting out old carpeting from my home, it cuts through the carpet like a hot knife would cut through a stick of butter.Not only that, but I have also used this tool to cut down my Amazon Delivery boxes for easy removal, some boxes that may have a very thick form, it will cut them, but it's a little harder to get the tool through those, but most standard boxes, it makes short work of them, cutting them down to small square sections in less time than it does to break them down by hand and cut them down with a standard pair of scissor.My wife cut down a box of the same size using scissors, and I was using the tool, I had completed the complete cut-down of my box, same exact size as here, in less than 5 minutes, while she was still struggling to get her box cut down to size for the trash bag, her box was still over 70% intact, I cut down various size boxes, a total of 15 boxes from medium to very large, in the time it took her to cut down the one box she was working on.I have used the tool to cut Coroplast, thin plexiglass, this plastic sheeting, and very thin wood molding for interior door frames, when the tool started slowing down and cutting became more difficult, I knew it was either time to recharge the tool, or sometimes just hold the tool, not cutting anything, hold in the safety button in and power button, to allow the tool to run with no cutting, this will resharpen the blade, and if the tool still has enough of a charge, continue cutting until it bogs down, then a simple recharge takes care of that.Just about anything you cut with a pair of sharp scissors, this tool would probably cut as well.Yes, I can recommend this tool, it's a great tool to have in your arsenal of home improvement and cleanup tools.  It will definitely help you get the job down much faster than a manual cutting tool for many different materials, which makes it an indispensable, versatile, and worthy tool to have.",5
B019CSHSW8,"Wife and I were tearing carpet out of the room.  Some sections of the carpet and mat underneath had to be cut.  I tried a few different tools, box knife, scissors, and manual carpet cutting tool.  All were adequate but once I got to cutting the mat, it was a lot tougher. I figured that had to be some type of automated cutting tool, did a bit of research, came across this tool and decided to take a chance and buy it.The tool arrived the same day as ordered, I charged it overnight and it was ready to work the next day.  The verdict, it worked effortlessly and flawlessly on both the carpet and the mat underneath, saving me sooo much time and intense labor.  I think I'll pick up the carrying case for this as well.While the main initial use for me was for the carpet, it also works great on cardboard and lots of other surfaces.  There's a lot of youtube videos for this product and they all seem to rave about it as well.",5
B019CSHSW8,"We love receiving our packages these days but the boxes they come in take up a lot of space. Then comes the task of breaking down these boxes safely so they can be disposed. I have several razor knives for this task which required constant blade changes and the possibility of severe cuts from their use. Had to keep the blades changed since a dull razor is just as dangerous as a sharp blade.Enter the Worx Zipsnip Cordless Electric Scissors. These things have cut various thicknesses of cardboard boxes. Regardless of the thickness it cuts through with ease and the motor isn't strained maintaining the same rpm and cutting speed. I no longer worry about cutting or slicing a finger or other body part while breaking down boxes. Can cut cardboard to the smallest size to fit my box container, trashcan or whatever your disposal needs.Recently did a project involving PU Leather and used scissors and a razor knife. I did a test cut with some of the left over material. In the photo there is a small strip of this leather with the top side cut with scissors and the bottom with Zipsnip. The difference is huge. Top side was uneven and bottom was a smooth straight unlined cut. If photo rotates once posted the orientation will be left right. The Zipsnip cut this thin leather like it was cutting air.Anyways, these things are awesome! Having used these for the last six weeks I can say build quality, battery life, and cutting capabilities are worth the price.",5
B019CSHSW8,"Tool does work and my friend loves it.  Sadly, because you cannot operate it without holding in the button in addition to the trigger, I cannot operate it.  My hand cannot reach both the safety button and the trigger at the same time.  If I could have, I would have rated this as a 4 or 5 as it does a great job cutting through boxes which is what I purchased it for.I will keep as others can use it when they are around.",3
B019CSHSW8,"I took the rotary cutter straight out of the box, held the safety button and squeezed the handle. It wasn't loud so, I wondered if it was fully charged yet, it smoothly cut through amazon delivery box cardboard with an edge rather than chopping through it. It isn't as loud as my cordless electric scissors I usually use as I always cut down cardboard before tossing into the recycle bin to conserve space and such. The Works cordless rotary cutter slightly pulls your hand through the cardboard. It's satisfying cutting the boxes down with this tool you're not going to have a stack to cut you'll chop them up so fast. Its oddly satisfying to use, and the little person inside me is cheering for this small luxury lifehack. I agree, the five star review for this item is a fair rating.Amazon, you should promo these with prime memberships! It would make me sign up. Again. Well I am a member now but if I wasn't this would definitely make me sign on.",5
B019CSHSW8,"After the holiday stack of boxes and furniture packaging was stacking up in the garage, I decided a device like this might help speed the process up.  It made quick work of all the boxes!  I used to use a box knife, which worked fine but seemed to take a more time, especially when the bade started to dull.  This electric scissor did the trick!  I wish I'd gotten one sooner.It does feel like I have to angle it a bit to get it to cut well (I'm left handed so that might be a factor).I do kind of with it had USB-C charging instead of the proprietary plug and socket, but that's not a huge issue.I haven't used it on anything other than boxes, so I can't speak to how well it does with other material.  Highly recommend.",5
B019CSHSW8,"I basically bought this to use cutting up all the Amazon boxes we constantly get....hmmm.  Any way in my advancing years it gets tiring use an old box cutter especially on some of the heavier weight cardboard.  I was hoping this would help and it does, but not all that much.  To start you need to cut the tape on the box so I use the old box cutter any way.  I would be nice if they could add a little pop out blade for cutting the tape.  After that this cuts well, but it still takes some effort on the thicker boxes.  It's just not sharp enough or strong enough to cut through easily and you have to push hard at the correct angle.  I works, but a fresh blade in the box cutter would probably work almost as well.",4
B019CSHSW8,"Arrived on time and as described.HOLY MOLY! Charge these up and then go tackle the pile of boxes in the garage!At first I thought that you had to continuously hold your thumb/finger on the safety button along with the power trigger to get them to work, which frankly was a bit much! However, duh, my 11 yr.old grandson figured out that all you had to do is engage the safety button and they would just keep cutting without having to hold the safety button the whole time...when in doubt, get a child to figure it out, right?  Anywho my first project with these was to just sit down one afternoon and cut up all the amazon boxes I could in one day small enough to put through my paper shredder so I could make cardboard shreds to put into the compost bin with other yard waste. Next was to cut up pieces just the correct size to line the base of the rubbish bins, then a few more perfectly sized pieces to line the base of garden pots and to lay under soil as a weed barrier. WOOF! IT took forever, but I did it and it is paying off!  My grandson then took a whack at the still mountain of boxes left and filled the recycle rubbish bin to the brink with small lengths of flat pieces!  I can tell you that two days of minor work as PAID the worth of these rotary scissors!I did purchase these on sale, however, for how easily they can make cutting THICK cardboard-- these are a bargain for the regular price in my book.BOTTOM LINE: Even not on sale these might be worth their weight in gold! DEFINITELY Recommend!",5
B019CSHSW8,"OMG !THIS LITTLE GADGET IS A LIFE SAVER!!  I had so many boxes from Amazon it was taking up my garage.  I ordered this little gadget & HOLY MOLY in one day I cut up 50 boxes & put them in my trash>  THANK YOU WORX!  I LOVE U>  by the way I ordered another one for my son in law who helps me out a lot with different chores.  with my daughter & her Amazon boxes, this will help him a lot.",5
B019CSHSW8,"I get a lot of boxes, and using an ordinary box cutter on them got to be a real pain for this old guy. So I got this cutter and cut up ten boxes yesterday with no strain at all. I hope it cuts through heavy duty, thick cardboard like they ship appliances in, because that's the last box I have to deal with. Wish me luck!",5
B019CSHSW8,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was thinking of my wife at Christmas time when purchasing this because of the constant cutting of wrapping paper that ultimately leads to ripping, tearing, waste and frustration. Well, this thing eats wrapping paper for breakfast! I thought it might also come in handy for the grade of cardboard that all our packages come in and I was pleasantly surprised at how easily it cut through that.  Finally, I bought some thick, heavy duty cardboard to put over our countertops for a demolition project. I expected to have to use a razor knife to trim the cardboard to size, it being so thick. But I thought I'd give the scissors a try and I'm so glad I did. There was some resistance but I was able to make long, straight, one-handed cuts that made this job a ton easier. (See video.) I think this cutter is going to join the Worx 20V cordless reciprocating saw as the most reached-for tools in my collection.PS: I do wish Worx would include cases for their tools instead of having to find them after the fact. Be that as it may, I recommend this one for the scissors.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL39W287/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1",5
B019CSHSW8,"I bought one for my father (83)... He likes to cut his recycling boxes and uses a box cutter.That scares the wee out of me!! LOL!!So, I charged it up and tested it.I love this thing. Works so good, and so safe, that I bought one for my self too!Where has this been all my life?!?!",5
B019CSHSW8,Took a while to receive but really wanted this one since I love Worx products. Was amassing quite a collection of cardboard boxes recently and needed a quick and easy way to break them down.  This is it.  Love it!,5
B019CSHSW8,"There is nothing to dislike about this tool. Cuts down on the time to breakdown cardboard boxes. The WORX Zip tool is one of the best, If you don't have one, buy one, best investment in small tools you can make!",5
B019CSHSW8,This is an incredible product because it's so easy to maneuver. The fact that it comes with a charger is a major plus. The ability to cut through tough materials is mind-blowing. And the safety trigger and lock-out? A welcome feature. It's been a game changer for all the packages I receive! Absolutely recommend it.,5
B019CSHSW8,"Works great, got it for my child as a Christmas gift for his crafting. Sharp enough for the job, a little noisy but as expected for a handheld tool. Will buy again if needed.",5
B019CSHSW8,watch a lots of video on cutters and this one is a good one for the price. it works good cuts great. and i am happy....,5
B019CSHSW8,Great cutter. Excellent for cutting cardboard boxes. Not too heavy and great for disabled elder person like myself.,5
B019CSHSW8,"The product seems to be able to do what I need it for, however it is missing the rechargeable cord and  I am unable to connect to supplier",5
B019CSHSW8,"I've ordered and loved using two of these units in the past.  Both of them had the lock-out switch up on top of the unit within very easy reach of the thumb.  Operating those units was very easy and intuitive due to the logical placement of the two controls needed to turn them on and start cutting.  However, when I ordered a third unit, I didn't notice that the start button on top had been moved down to the bottom-side, which requires you to stop, look for the switch, stretch your thumb awkwardly down to push the switch while your fingers grip the long second switch bar at the bottom of the unit in order to get the unit to turn on.  Had I noticed this new feature, I never would have bought the unit.  One other annoying thing is that the connector for the power is no longer a standard micro-USB, but instead it's something that is non-standard (with its own transformer ""brick"") which means I can't charge it like my existing rotary cutter using a simple cable with USB-A at one end and micro-USB at the other.  Guess I'll try to return it and buy a similar unit from another manufacturer who's design is like what I'm used to.  If I can't return it, perhaps I'll look into finding a way to force the side lock-out switch/button to stay permanently pressed in.",3
B019CSHSW8,Struggled with large boxes.  But it does work,4

He's very happy with it and now able to complete projects in less time due to the use of ZipSnip!",5
B019CSHSW8,"I test drove this thing on some heavy cardboard that came with my lawn mower bagger and man, buzzed right thru it with almost no hesitation, cuts single cardboard no problem, super quick, super clean cuts, on double cardboard, definitely have to take it a little slower but never quit, never slowed down, on my first battery so will see how long it will take to run it out, if you need to cut up boxes to fit into your recycling bin, you are good to go but overall, definitley a buy!",5
B019CSHSW8,"I had a ton of cardboard, especially because I bought new treadmill, and I moved into a new house with a small recycle bin. Everything was building up and I had to break everything down to try to maximize as much as possible when recycle comes. A box cutter was literally And figuratively just not cutting it. I found these on Amazon and began using them as soon as they arrived. It literally cuts like butter. The ginormous, thick, heavy treadmill cardboard was broken down within a minute. This is so life-changing. I highly recommend.",5

This is one of those item where, after you get it, you'll wonder how you could go so long without it! This is the first one I've ever had, but it really does the job. I haven't had to recharge it yet, and it's been months and dozens of boxes since I last charged it. This is quite highly recommended.",5

B019CSHSW8,"This is a really positive review because the product is incredibly lightweight. It barely weighs a pound, which makes it super handy to use. I definitely recommend it, particularly for those who need a convenient tool for their projects. It's a great addition to my toolbox!",5
B019CSHSW8,Makes short work of any cardboard box saving large amounts of space in garbage cans.,5
B019CSHSW8,Works really well!,5
B019CSHSW8,We are crazy about this convenient handheld tool.  It's great for cutting cardboard to go out with recycling. Cutting through plastic packaging is a dream. It's a gadget worth getting!,4
B019CSHSW8,Easy to use,5
B019CSHSW8,"I am a sewist; this tool cut my fabric pieces out better than I ever have been able to manage with scissors! I am in love.  It is safe to use, it doesn't go too fast and the safety guard is reliable.",5
B019CSHSW8,GOOD VALUE PRODUCT.,4
B019CSHSW8,"cuts real smooth, thank you!",5
B019CSHSW8,Works great,5
B019CSHSW8,After a quick charge. Used to cut boxes and paper and foam boards even ribbon! This is so useful and makes life great,5
B019CSHSW8,"I recommend this product for anyone into crafting. It's easy to maneuver and lightweight, only 1 lbs! Love that it can cut through tough materials. The cordless electric scissors feature is a bonus. I also appreciate the safety trigger and lock-out. Comes with a charger too. Definitely worth the price.",5
B019CSHSW8,Saw a friend breaking down cardboard boxes with this and had to have one.,5
B019CSHSW8,"I have read a lot of the reviews on the Worx ZipSnip and my experience varies from others. The Worx is a valuable tool for me as between Amazon, Costco, and other vendors I have a lot of boxes to break down. While some others state that Worx can not cut thicker cardboard that has not been my experience. Even the thick produce boxes from Costco with some elbow grease behind the ZipSnip will cut through those boxes. It is still easier to use than a manual box cutter and much safer. What I do share with other reviewers is that the time to recharge is very slow. I tend to let the boxes pile up so I do sometimes run the battery down but if you are doing 10 or fewer boxes at any one time the charging time should not be a hindrance.",4
B019CSHSW8,Good for the money,4
B019CSHSW8,They work very well,5
B019CSHSW8,Getting older with arthritis in hands so using scissors can be hard.  This works well and fast.  Cuts those plastic packages well.  Charge and use.  Makes life easier.,5
B019CSHSW8,Works well. Saves me a lot of room,5
B019CSHSW8,We bought this to deal with all the cardboard boxes from the holidays and it chewed right through them!,5
B019CSHSW8,Want help breaking down those boxes!? This tool will cut through in seconds. Where has this been all my life!?,5
B019CSHSW8,"Where has this thing been??  This tool is amazing!! Especially after Christmas, it just slices those boxes up!!!  LOVE THIS ITEM!!!",5
B019CSHSW8,Good,4
B019CSHSW8,Works good and quiick. No complains. Wish I could lock it in the on position.,5
B019CSHSW8,Great,5
B019CSHSW8,I bought this to cut up cardboard boxes specially around the house. It does a fine job.,5
B019CSHSW8,"This tool works reasonably well except for two things.1.  As mentioned in my title, the designers went a little TOO far in protecting you from the blade.  Consequently, the bottom guide really doesn't allow using the tool to cut up heavier ""double wall"" cardboard boxes.  So for those (one of the places the tool would be the most useful), you're relegated to a plain old utility knife.2.  Despite the (overly) well protected blade, there is also a mechanical ""safety interlock"" button which must be depressed before you can operate the trigger and start the tool.  Once out of the way, it WILL stay depressed on its own until the trigger is released, but it takes a bit of manual dexterity to initially move the interlock out of the way and simultaneously press the trigger.  At least they designed this feature so it can be operated from either side.  Note, though, that if you're left handed the tool obscures your view of the blade, so you can't easily see what you're doing.  But granted, that's not terribly important if all you're doing is demolishing boxes for the recycling bin.It's a decent tool, but due to the two limitations above, mine sees much more limited use than anticipated.  I doubt that I'd buy it again.",4
B019CSHSW8,It cuts up my boxes with ease. All the boxes I've since getting it has worked great.,5
B019CSHSW8,"These scissors are great for cutting up cardboard for recycling. It has made a tough job easy. The scissors cut through cardboard quickly, and I can fit more in my recycling bins. I highly recommend these scissors. I even bought one pair as a gift.",5
B019CSHSW8,I've used it numerous times to cut up boxes.  Great tool for that purpose.,5
B019CSHSW8,I am so pleased with these cutters. I needed something to cut up cardboard boxes and these do the trick. Easy to hold and handle.,5
B019CSHSW8,"cutting cardboard boxes into pieces is a breeze, no effort at all. you need to consistently push forward to make a clean cut & prevent being stuck. i was able to cut around 10 boxes with still much charge on the battery when i stopped. good buy for the money. get spare blades if you plan to be cutting a lot.",5
B019CSHSW8,I need this for all the boxes I get.. thanks,5
B019CSHSW8,"I LOVE this product! For whatever reason, I assume town budget, our town only picks up recycling every other week. This really hinders at times our ability to recycle all the things because boxes build up and even though we break things down this tool helps in really taking everything apart with ease. Little effort goes into completely taking hard diaper boxes etc down to super flat pieces. It has completely changed the way we are able to recycle. I fully recommend this product!",5
B019CSHSW8,Makes breaking down boxes much easier,5
B019CSHSW8,"Easy to use and cuts almost any non metallic material very well. Especially effective at opening those plastic sealed ""bubble ""sealed packages that are so hard to open. Not designed for heavy duty commercial use, but very useful as a household cutting tool. Particularly useful if you have arthritic or joint problems that make cutting with shears or scissors painful, or difficult.",5
B019CSHSW8,"Very easy to use and very efficient.  Bought to use to cut up boxes for recycling, but just used it to cut a rubber mat for my SUV.  Was light weight but handled the job very easily.  Great value.  Would buy again.",5
B019CSHSW8,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I purchased this tool in December of 2022 and it's well worth it! Blade is still sharp and is a high quality product. If you purchase alot of Amazon packages like myself and need any easy-to-use tool to break down the boxes, this product is it!",5
B019CSHSW8,"Love this... I'm always slightly terrified of cutting myself badly when breaking down big boxes with a standard blade box cutter.  This makes it quick, easy, and safe.Wish the blade turned a little big faster, but it still makes quick work of even the largest pieces of card board.It's not for opening boxes... just really doesn't work that way.  But when you want to break down those big boxes into smaller pieces, this is the gadget you want to have handy.  Love it!",4
B019CSHSW8,"Sometimes items arrive in boxes that are quite sizeable, so large I can't wedge them into my small car to drive them up the street to the dumpster.  And I sure as heck ain't gonna drag them up there on foot, that's for sure.  That's where this little beauty earns its keep.  A few swipes of this cutter and the box is whittled down to a manageable size.  Same thing when I buy a firearm or anything of value and don't want to advertise it to the neighborhood.  Go over the box with this and stick the small stack of cardboard into a trashbag and nobody's the wiser.I'll admit it, I've purchased a lot of stupid stuff from Amazon over the years but this ain't one of them. This is a keeper.  Highly recommended.",5
B019CSHSW8,"I actually like the cutter when it holds its charge, but have had problems with the charging capabilities. When the green light indicating a full charge was shown, I tried cutting with it and it had no charge at all, so I think the charging capabilities are a bit funky!",4
B019CSHSW8,"If you're a do-it-yourself fanatic, you need the WORX WX082L 4V ZipSnip Cordless Electric Scissors. I was immediately impressed by the electric scissors' ease of use, accuracy of cuts, and effectiveness. These shears have become an indispensable tool for me, and I have no hesitation in giving them a perfect score of five stars.The WORX ZipSnip Cordless Electric Scissors stand out due to its portability and user-friendliness. The lack of a chord frees me to walk about freely, and the low weight means I can wear them for long periods of time without discomfort. The ergonomic shape and secure grip make quick work of any cutting job, no matter how small the space or difficult the material.These electric shears have unbelievable accuracy when cutting. High-quality blades are razor sharp and can easily cut through paper, cloth, leather, plastic, and even thin metals. This flexibility has saved me time and effort by removing the necessity for a plethora of different cutting instruments. The ease with which the scissors sliced through even thicker materials, producing clean edges and minimizing the need for additional finishing touches, was quite impressive to me.Even more impressive than their cutting performance is the WORX ZipSnip Cordless Electric Scissors' long battery life. Thanks to the longevity of the 4V lithium-ion battery, I can use the scissors for long periods of time without having to worry about charging them. This is a huge perk, especially for time-sensitive assignments where having a dependable tool is of the utmost importance.The WORX electric scissors have been designed with safety considerations in mind, making them a better tool overall. The lock-out switch ensures the scissors are only turned on when necessary, avoiding inadvertent beginnings. Reduce the potential for harm and increase security with this well-considered design.The tool's minimalist design makes routine cleaning and upkeep easy. Because the blades are detachable, cleaning up messes is a breeze, and the scissors are well-made, you can count on them to hold up even after repeated uses.The WORX ZipSnip Cordless Electric Scissors have been reliable helpmates in all my cutting endeavors, whether they be home improvement, craft, or elsewhere. Their ability to create clean cuts every time, combined with their portability and long battery life, make them a must-have for any workshop. I've noticed an increase in both speed and quality since I started using these electric scissors. They earn a perfect score because of how well they function and how many different uses there are for them.",5
B019CSHSW8,I have to learn how to use to it so I can get the best way to cut things.,5
B019CSHSW8,"It cuts nicely, however, trying to keep your finger on the lock button at the same time as pressing the start handle with the same hand is very difficult and uncomfortable if you have small hands. I gave it to a friend and they liked it.",5
B019CSHSW8,"I purchased this so I could break up multiple cardboard boxes for recycling.If you are looking for one that is self propelled on cardboard - this isn't it. You will have to exert some pressure to push it thru the cardboard, but there is NO doubt this makes breaking down the boxes SO much easier!!!I was able to fit so much more in my recycling bin by cutting down the boxes with this instead of just breaking them down.I'm taking this to work so I can use it there too!",4
B019CSHSW8,Cuts up cardboard boxes with ease. Time saver for sure. Would buy again!!!,5
B019CSHSW8,"I bought this to trim down some carpet pads that were a bit too long. It took a few minutes to get the handle of using it, but it's fairly intuitive and once I figured it out, it was easy to use. The cutter can be used right out of the box after a quick charge. The cut was easy and smooth, similar to scissors through wrapping paper, except you have to keep tension on the end that's being cut loose. The grip is not bad and is tooled to be used by a lefty or righty with ease. This is an easy recommend.",5
B019CSHSW8,Works great! Makes it so much easier to cut down boxes to recycle,5
B00DOAVCN2,"I bought these to go with my cordless Ryobi hot glue gun. They work great, fit well, and melt properly.",5
B00DOAVCN2,They are perfect for my crafts. I use alot of hot glue for different crafts. I love the price for the count of glue sticks. They're durable and hold together well. They dry clear so match any color for the most part.,5
B00DOAVCN2,"I buy this glue all the time.  I use it for gluing down an extra piece of cardboard on shipping boxes I am using.  I find that if you glue the tabs of the box down plus put an extra piece to fill the bottom, there is a slighter chance that you will have an item broken during shipping.  It is that extra protection.  The glue holds well and does a good job.  The sticks are not very big and I use a lot of them.  The only thing I don't like is they cool off too quickly in the gun.  So I have to wait for the glue to heat up again to use another squirt.  But a large quantity for a good price.",4
B00DOAVCN2,Excellent product at a very good price. Does just what it is supposed to do. My second or third purchase of same item.,5

B00DOAVCN2,"used for hobbies, worked well",5
B00DOAVCN2,Received as described,5
B00DOAVCN2,These work perfectly for the mini hot glue gun of the same brand! I like how much came in the package as I am always running out,5
B00DOAVCN2,I recently got into crafting and looked to get inexpensive glue sticks and these fit the bill. I have had zero problems with them and they have been really good at what glue sticks do. The package says they are high-temp but they run through my low-temp gun easily,5
B00DOAVCN2,The glue quality is good and fulfills its function,5
B00DOAVCN2,Good for mini glue guns.,4
B00DOAVCN2,"Speedy delivery,  great quality, affordable pricing.",4

B00DOAVCN2,Glue gun is lowTemperature andThese fit and worked fine.,4
B00DOAVCN2,Had bought regular glue sticks at a store previously and learned that there are two different sizes of hot glue gun sticks! Mine unfortunately took the mini size so the ones I'd originally gotten at the store didn't fit. Couldn't find the mini glue sticks nearby so I bought these. Work just like my original sticks did and fit the mini perfectly.,5

B00DOAVCN2,Mini glue sticks. Fast and easy.,5
B00DOAVCN2,"I've used this glue a few times now to adhere safety eyes onto my crochet plushies. The glue sticks very well to the blanket and acrylic yarn that I use. I've had no problem so far with anything falling out, even when I give it a good tug. Very easy to use, just plug in a stick to your glue gun and you're ready to go. I was concerned that the quality would not be great as it's a large pack for not much money, but it's absolutely worth it, especially if you're trying to cut on costs for your crafted items!",5
B00DOAVCN2,"Have ordered before, will again.",5
B00DOAVCN2,Well these really come in handy when your doing a little diy project around the house,5
B00DOAVCN2,Good deal will buy again when I run low on them.,5

B00DOAVCN2,Fits perfectly in the mini glue gun. I use these the time for craft projects and this brand is a good quality product. Not a ton of spinny webs when pulling away from the project. Great value!,5
B00DOAVCN2,Great for crafting,4
B00DOAVCN2,"I was surprised when I got these glue sticks. Not because they were glue sticks. They all melt in my high temp gun (a Surebonder mini). But they are crystal clear! The glue sticks I'd always bought from the craft store were clear, or so I thought. Maybe because they were dual temp and not high temp I'm not sure, but I was very pleased that these are crystal clear sticks.I'm building a small version of a 2 story house, framing and all, and to say I go through a lot of glue sticks would be an understatement. These bond the craft sticks and birchwood plywood very well. I've never had a problem with them falling or peeling off, even if I only use a little bit of glue. They bond Lexan and wood extremely well too. I use the Lexan for the windows. Even high temperature hot glue will not bond stone, glass, or any other material that holds on to temperatures (for instance marble which will keep warm if heated and stay cool if not) The cool surface just makes the glue very smooth and stiff and will not hold for an extended amount of time.Perfect for crafters. I've used it to bond wood, plastic, fabric (use low temp for fragile fabric such as silks), rope, and painted surfaces. Very tough when dry and only takes about 20 second to dry. You only have about 5 to adjust any mistakes though.And I find that when you get it on your fingers, rub your fingers together immediately and it will roll the glue, saving your fingers from nasty burns. If you just shake and say ow you're going to have blisters ;)",5
B00DOAVCN2,can't find this size glue stix in any store.  Grab them while you can.,5
B00DOAVCN2,We go through a lot of glue sticks at home. This one was the most affordable in terms of quality and number of sticks. Size is for mini hot glue gun.,5
B00DOAVCN2,Everything was good! I have no negative things to say about these.,5
B00DOAVCN2,Way cheaper than craft stores,5
B00DOAVCN2,Best value.  Great product.,4
B00DOAVCN2,Great product and great value.  First time buying this brand and it works great. Def will be buying again,5

B00DOAVCN2,Just Your average glue sticks and they work fine,5
B00DOAVCN2,Great,5
B00DOAVCN2,"One single glue stick lasted longer than the ones I usually buy in the store! I would normally go through 5 glue sticks easily while making 6 crochet flowers, but one of these glue sticks made over 6 flowers for me. Also seems to be nice and sturdy.",5
B00DOAVCN2,These glue sticks melt at the right speed to use in my crafting.,5
B00DOAVCN2,I just got some more that work great if you do arts and crafts I do a lot of stuff with my mini glue gun and the glue sticks go in the glue gun so you can put your arts and crafts together with hot glue,5
B00DOAVCN2,Great value for the price. Good quality and easy to use. Dries quick.,5
B00DOAVCN2,My kids glue everything so having a large amount is a nice bonus.  One got stuck today but not if it was my boys misuse or an issue with the product. Will see how it goes. So far though seems good.,4
B00DOAVCN2,A large amount of glue sticks for a very good price. Arrived quickly and without problems. I recommend,5
B00DOAVCN2,"Its easy enough to work with and does what it should. So far it has not yellowed and has stayed clear. It is not ""stringless"" but I don't need it to be and don't see the need for the extra cost.",5
B00DOAVCN2,Great product for the price.,5
B00DOAVCN2,I usually purchase the gorilla glue sticks but I tried these ones instead because It had more in a pack and it was cheaper but when I went to use them for my craft boards a lot of the materials kept falling off even if I would simply bump it on accident.,4
B00DOAVCN2,These were a great buy for when I'm working on miniatures; the glue is clear and works perfectly in my hot glue gun. I will definitely purchase them again!,5
B00DOAVCN2,They melt,5
B00009RUCS,Very little stringing with these glue sticks,5
B00009RUCS,"These are my go-to when I need more glue for my Hot Glue gun. They're great quality. They melt perfectly and don't cause unnecessary troubles with my hot glue gun. The glue holds nicely and dries perfectly. I don't have to wait long for it to melt it dry. Having bought them more than a few times now, I can for sure say that with this price point, you can't find a deal of this quality anywhere else.",5
B00009RUCS,"Bought for project.  Adhesive quality is good, stays clear.  Dries fast and easy to use to refill glue gun.Good purchase.",4
B00009RUCS,"These are some of the best hot glue sticks on the market, I run out really quickly, because I am constantly crafting, but they work well with my glue gun, and I haven't had a problem so far! Plus for the price it's a really good deal! I would recommend getting a couple bags if you have a large craft though.",5
B00009RUCS,"Glue sticks work perfect, very durable, value for the price. Size is perfect fit beautifully in my glue gun",5
B00009RUCS,Good,5

B00009RUCS,Excelente,5
B00009RUCS,"I used them to secure a candle wick to the bottom of a jar. I don't even have a glue gun. I just used a lighter on the end for just a short moment, then touched it to the bottom of the jar. Then set the wick, easy peasy.  The price I right, the bond was tight and they cool and solidify quickly.",5

B00009RUCS,Works great and as expected. I love that it's clear and works just like the sticks I buy in stores. Easy shipping. Would totally buy again,5
B00009RUCS,They don't work very good on certain items. The glue stops sticking for some.reason? I don't know if it's meant for only certain material? I used it on plastic and a cheap tin pan and it came apart. Used it on plastic to plastic it came apart. Tried to use it on wood it came apart.. Maybe only good for fabric or paper? It dries fast too so you have to hurry to use it or it hardens within seconds.,3
B00009RUCS,Clearquick to heatGood buy,5
B00009RUCS,These little glue sticks work great for small objects.  The only problem is that they melt too fast and are gone.  For small craft items this product works great.,4

B00009RUCS,Great value for non-yellowing hot glue gun glue sticks.,5
B00009RUCS,"They work. I bought these for making flowered sun hats at a tea party, and I did not use even half of them, so the sticks last pretty well.",5
B00009RUCS,I have tried gluing light weight sticks and moss and twine and in a week I'm seeing things just fall off of my crafts. I don't know maybe I'm doing something wrong?,4

B00009RUCS,"I thought these were going to be much thicker than what I received.  Fortunately, my glue gun didn't seem to mind these glue sticks, and all worked out well.",5
B00009RUCS,Its glue sticks works like the other glue sticks no issue,4
B00009RUCS,The glue is very strong it holds together wood projects solid. Also good for making DIY speaker boxes airtight. Surprisingly Strong. Better than others I've used in the past. Great Price too!,5
B00009RUCS,This was the perfect solution to filter hair in our shower. Long lasting and super effective! Such a great idea.,5
B00009RUCS,I have a mini glue gun and these fit great and so many for the price. I haven't noticed anything I've glued to become loose,5

B00009RUCS,Works like a glue stick should! lol,5
B00009RUCS,"After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical about buying these glue sticks for my glue gun. They arrived and I tried the glue out on several different types of fabric and crafts. It works just like all of the other glue sticks that I have bought at a craft store. It sticks and stays like it should.",5
B00009RUCS,This is good,5
B00009RUCS,The hot glue holds a strong bond in 30 seconds and useful for most craft materials,5
B00009RUCS,Works great,5
B00009RUCS,It's a great value and cheaper than getting it from stores!,5
B00009RUCS,Good quality for the money,5
B00009RUCS,"I had issues with my rumba not working on my rugs with black designs because it triggered the cliff sensors in a weird way. I saw a DIY about covering the sensors in ""clear"" hot glue so trick it. Worked perfectly! Great glue! Obviously not perfectly clear but clearer than the standard hot glue. Still holding up while my vacuum runs every day so seems sturdy enough!",5
B00009RUCS,I thought these were standard size but they are somehow too big (in diameter) for my glue gun. I can still use it but I have to jam it in with something else.,4
B00009RUCS,"They're opaque glue sticks, like many of the other brands.  Very annoying when you specifically need very CLEAR glass-like glue for a project and opaque will not work so you spend extra time searching through blurry product photos for clear glue.  Why bother to name it ""CRYSTAL CLEAR Glue Sticks"" if that's the ONE trait it doesn't have?  Presumably they work fine as CLOUDY glue.",1
B00009RUCS,Helped me make a bouquet! Very useful,5
B00009RUCS,Very happy with these glue sticks. They did not have the stringiness of other ones. Worked great. Definitely would buy again,5
B00009RUCS,They fit the ryobi mini hot glue gun perfectly,5
B00009RUCS,Trying to find some less stringy . Sones like a lot string when using very frustrating but good price,4
B00009RUCS,Great value,5
B00009RUCS,Good amount of glue for my mini glue gun.,5
B00009RUCS,Perfect for home projects,5
B00009RUCS,Very easy to use just insert in glue gun and use. This hot glue works on everything almost fix broken ceramics to working on wood. Adhesion is top quality. With the little money I spent I definitely recieve my money's worth and stocked up on glue for this Christmas projects!!!,5
B00009RUCS,"The strips are very good, have a small taste but are sticky, and the size is just right.",5
B00009RUCS,Great price and the glue sticks work well,5
B00009RUCS,I cannot tell you anything else since I only used it on one project and it was to glue wood to wood. It's just as advertised. Thanks,5
B00009RUCS,I like to buy the brand of glue sticks from the same company as the gun when possible as I feel it works the best. Very happy with this brand,5
B00009RUCS,Perfect,5
B00009RUCS,"This was a really a good buy on Amazon. Cheaper than Walmart or $ Tree! I've used this product for years, I like this brand and the price can't be beat.  It also came quickly.",5
B00009RUCS,I needed a lot of glue for my wine cork DIY's. These met and exceeded my expectations. I didn't have to use as many as I thought I would. They seem to be holding well and not as messing as some I have used. I shopped around locally and found that you get a lot more glue sticks for the price.,5
B00009RUCS,Work as they should!,4
B00009RUCS,Works great,5
B00009RUCS,Worked good,5
B00009RUCS,Works great for most crafting and cheap. Thanks,4
B00009RUCS,It's pretty standard hot glue,5
B00009RUCS,Love the ampunt and price,5
B00009RUCS,Serves its purpose.,5
B00009RUCS,"Works great when I'm crafting ,has sticking power",5
B00009RUCS,Works great good glue sticks,5
B00009RUCS,These are good glue sticks and economical compared to going to a craft store to get same brand. Craft store sells bag of 30 and is more expensive. Great buy!,5
B00009RUCS,They worked like a glue stick should.  No problems.,5
B00009RUCS,"These glue sticks work fine in my mini glue gun, but they're kind of hit or miss in terms of stringing. Some sticks hardly have any strings stretching between the gun and the glued pieces, others are like string cheese. Once the glue has set, it adheres well and dries clear.For the price, they're a good deal.",3
B00009RUCS,"Love them, very good quality, just the size I needed",5
B00009RUCS,Great produce easy usage,5
B08S7HR1BG,Very happy with Kit. All the products work well in our crafts. Good quality at a good price. A good variety of sizes is very helpful.,5
B08S7HR1BG,I love the different sizes and the fact that it comes with a neat case to store it all in. I labeled each section based on the insert they provided and the Amazon listing so that I know the sizes and which size washer to use. Great product overall and super easy to use!,5
B08S7HR1BG,"I like the variety of sizes for the eyes and noses. However, I was disappointed that there is no labeling to decipher what size is what. I was able to easily find it after coming back to my order, but it would've been nice to have it already etched into the case itself. I do like the quality of the case because it has four snap closures to ensure it won't pop open on you. The color is a sharp, crisp black and my set doesn't have any defects mentioned in other reviews with the exception that some of the posts seem to lean to one side, but I'm presuming I can still work with them. I would most likely buy them again because they seem like a nice price point for the quantity and quality of the product.",4
B08S7HR1BG,Love these! So cute and easy to use. I am looking forward to making more plushies with these!,5
B08S7HR1BG,I have used these in a lot of my projects. The different sizes allow for more flexibility during projects. They're easy to put in and good quality.,5
B08S7HR1BG,I have used these for crocheted amigurumi as well as felt characters.  They are easy to use.  Look good on the finished project.  They are tight and durable.  Various sizes are a big help in fitting.,5
B08S7HR1BG,"My main problem with this set is that the backs keep splitting with the 10mm eyes. The listing indicates to use the smallest washers with the 10mm eyes, and the quantity supports this (there aren't enough medium washers for the 10mm and the larger sizes). But the washers split every time I use 10mm eyes, so I'm going to run out of washers and I'm concerned that the eyes will fall out over time.This pack has a good variety of basic sizes. The noses are a nice touch, but the oval ones are an odd-shaped and I would have liked some pink noses. The washers come separately in bags, so you have to check each time to make sure you are using the correct ones. The eyes are a bit scratched up, so these aren't for your most precious projects.",4
B08S7HR1BG,These are easy to use and add a fun element to the piles of stuffed animals I've been making. I have neither the patience or time to embroider features so these are a great option.,5
B08S7HR1BG,These came as expected and work fine. I do wish the posts were a little shorter for use with flatter projects.,4
B08S7HR1BG,"This was the top recommendation for safety eyes so i bought it and was super disappointed to see it was eyes AND NOSES. I thought I could use them for some of the animals I make but they all look very distinctly like DOG noses and a lot of the amigurumi I make is cats or bunnies so the noses are pretty much useless to me which is a real bummer. The carrying case is nice and the chart that comes with it is also really nice too. My other complaint is that the washers for the eyes come in flimsy plastic bags that aren't resealable and there's nowhere to store them with the plastic container so that's a but of a hassle when I'm taking my crochet stuff on the go and have to make sure all the supplies I need are with me. Overall, the quality of the eyes have been good, but I'm disappointed that the eye size I needed the most is the least represented. I feel like I'm drowning in tiny eyes and dog noses. I'm hoping I can trade some to friends who have eyes in the sizes I need. Overall the product was good quality and I would buy from the seller again, but not this set, as it doesn't meet my specific needs.",4
B08S7HR1BG,The product needs labels to show what size is where in the plastic box.  What's so hard about the review to label the eyes and noses. I shouldn't have to resubmit.  Ridiculous,4
B08S7HR1BG,"Have only used a few so far, the seem to work well.",5
B08S7HR1BG,"As a crocheter, I use this all the time. I make many stuffed animals and these eyes always make my piece look much more professional. It comes in many different sizes and types, including a nose! The only thing that I would change is to add a bigger size for the eyes. But other that that they are perfect!",4
B08S7HR1BG,Very versatile with lots of size options.  Wish a device for clamping them was included though.,4
B08S7HR1BG,"I use these to make little miny whale keychains to give to my friends and possibly sell in the future. Some of the buttons were a little scratched up but I'm overall satisfied.They come in a variety of sizes, but mine wasn't separated into the container by size so I kind of had to figure it out while working with the buttons. I think these are great when you're making amigurumi designs and they're easy to use. They also last a long time.",4
B08S7HR1BG,A lot of produce for a small price,5
B08S7HR1BG,Perfect for project,5
B08S7HR1BG,These safety eyes are easy to use and I love that they also included noses. I really only needed the eyes but I'm sure in the future that I'll use the noses.,5
B08S7HR1BG,"Great sizes and variety of them, easy to use not sharp edges",5
B08S7HR1BG,My daughter recently learned to crochet and and likes making cute little animals. This kit came with a good selection of eye sizes and backs. Great for crafters!,5
B08S7HR1BG,"I love these safety eyes. They are super easy to attach. I have made so many projects using them, and I still have more. They are very secure and I do not see them coming off, or ever having any issue when I make stuffed animals for children.",5
B08S7HR1BG,Enjoyed using product easy to use,4
B08S7HR1BG,"I loved having so many options for safety eyes and noses. This was a good starter kit to buy for trying out different size safety eyes. However, many of the plastic fasteners had defects and would not stay attached to the eyes. Also, one or two of the eyes had defects as well and broke any fastener they were attached to. All in all, 80% success rate. I wouldn't purchase these again, but I got good use out of the product that worked.",4
B08S7HR1BG,Like the variety of sizes. Was a good buyp,5
B08S7HR1BG,"Some reviews mention the eyes are all mixed in the container, so I checked mine before using them.  There were a few in the wrong compartment, but it was due to there being more 10 mm eyes than would fit in one compartment.  One compartment was needed for each of the 5 mm, 6 mm, 8mm eyes, 1-1/2 needed for the 10 mm eyes, 2 needed for the 12 mm eyes, and 3 needed for the 14 mm eyes.  There was one needed for each of the nose style/size combos.  I had as many or more eyes as advertised except for one size where I was missing one.The washers are another story.  There were three crinkle bags of washers, along with three small self-close baggies to keep them in.  212 small, 105 medium, and 25 large.  I'm not clear on which sizes of eyes and noses goes with each of the washer sizes.  There are 33 noses that are 12-15mm or 10-14 mm, and thirty 14 mm eyes, so I'd think I need 63 of the largest washer size.  The medium washers fit the 12 mm eyes just fine.Some of the eyes and noses have burrs on the end of the stalks, but nothing that impedes the functionality.  Same with the washers.  The awl is a nice to have, but it's only good for piercing fabric, not creating a hole large enough for the stalks to fit through.Overall, I think this product is a good value for the seven dollars I paid.  I may not be able to use all the pieces, but I will still get my money's worth.",4
B08S7HR1BG,"The actual pieces are great and what is supplied is fantastic. I love the different size eyes and noses and it's great that they give you a diagram for what washers go with what pieces. But what is disappointing is that they just supply little bags for the washers, they could have spent a little more money and invested in a box with a couple more compartments to hold the washers so that everything is in one container along with the prong too as the box that the eyes & noses are in is really sturdy and has a great fastener too. So, now I will have to find something to house everything together myself. That's the only downside for me, otherwise I like the product.",4
B08S7HR1BG,The sizes were all there and the variety was nice. Value for money is pretty good and they seem durable and easy to use. The case is cheap however and doesn't have room for the washers themselves in it as well as it's already bent on one of the corners. I have cats so I wouldn't risk keeping them in this case for very long and will be buying a new one for it soon.,4
B08S7HR1BG,very good price point for the amount it comes with!,5
B08S7HR1BG,Would help if the sizes were labeled .  Hard to tell what size is what.  Container is flimsy. Supplies inside container hard to keep separate if tossed around .  But they are easy to use and serve their purpose well,3
B08S7HR1BG,Pieces are easy to use. Would be nice if there were more of the larger eyes and noses to choose from.,5
B08S7HR1BG,You get so much with this kit ! Multiple sizes and very good quality,5
B08S7HR1BG,"The eyes and noses themselves are great. However the washers are not. They don't SNAP in place and can be pulled apart easily, which doesn't make them  safe.",3
B08S7HR1BG,I used for my crochet and they good for all sizes totally recommend to buy it,5
B08S7HR1BG,"AMAZING price for the amount and selection of safety eyes! Be careful when you put the backs on that your eyes are in the right spot, because you have to cut the backs off if you want to move them, lol. But there are plenty!",5
B08S7HR1BG,OK; nothing special,3
B08S7HR1BG,"I liked the crochet book,and the eyes. I am not very happy with the lolli beads. I wanted the colors of each month of the year and I didn't get them. I will use them in my projects but I would've liked the right colors. Thank you",3
B08S7HR1BG,"The container lid does not ""snap"" into place. Therefore the blue lock tab needs to work. Well, if you look at my pictures, the tiny plastic hinge on the left came broken-it was inside the blue tab. Too small to glue back in place, it is useless to close the container and hangs crooked. The three sizes of backings came in separate unsealable plastic bags, so once you tear it open, you have loose and different sized backs. I used snack sized zip locked bags to ensure they stay separate for now. I will be getting a seperate container for all the pieces as I can foresee disaster. The container you choose should have at least 18 spots, so all the pieces fit including the backings. 20 would be ideal, as the quantity of backings need to be shared in two spots for small and medium-large backings can have one spot, now that I think about it.The eyes themselves are the first ones I have every worked with. They seem sturdy enough to stay in place but I would never give it to a child less than 5 just in case.  The shaft of the eye piece does not have a hole like I have seen on some, if that matters to you.Aside from the container, I have no complaints. My little ghosts can see!",4
B08S7HR1BG,"This is a great bang for your buck! I will say I was a little confused on how to use them at first, but a quick video search on the internet helped me through.  A good tip I found was to use a piece of felt on the backside/inside of the stuffed animal to keep it even more secure or to prevent it from slipping out.  I use these on my crochet stuffed animals and they are super cute!",5
B08S7HR1BG,"It would be a lot nicer if they had put a chart in the lid.As to what size of eye is in each compartment. I had to go with some.I bought elsewhere where I knew the size.And tried to compare them to the ones I purchased. After I had placed the order , I saw another item with the same number of eyes that had it in the lid of the box. Strongly.Suggest that you do this with each and every one of your boxes that have different sizes in each compartment. Other than that, I like the ease of being able to pick them up with the tool.And then having the washers in separate bags. Will probably look elsewhere for my next order.",4
B08S7HR1BG,These safety eyes and noses are great. Haven't run into any loose backs yet! Wonderful size assortment and the noses are so much fun. I'm going to have to look for patterns specifically to use them because they're so dang cute. Love the divided box. Even comes with a small awl to make pilot holes in fabric.,5
B08S7HR1BG,These safety eyes and noses are very easy to use. When used correctly they are secure and work well with all types of yarn. The range of sizes made the eyes are good option for many sizes of projects.,4
B08S7HR1BG,"Love the different sizes.  Easy to attach to the crocheted item.I must not have read the description because there are little noses in the box too!That was a fun surprise!  I will use them all!Great price, too!",5
B08S7HR1BG,These were nicer then the last ones I received. Great fit. I wanted the noses a little bit bigger but over all it worked out good.,4
B08S7HR1BG,They work great! Definitely glad I purchased for the price!,5
B08S7HR1BG,Might take me a few years to use all easy to use look great variety of sizes good value,5
B08S7HR1BG,I wish they labeled the sizes on the box or anywhere in/around the box.,4
B08S7HR1BG,Very quick shipping and seems to be good quality from what I have used so far!,4
B08S7HR1BG,I liked the large variety and the large amount.,5
B08S7HR1BG,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                this product is great for arugurumi. backings are a bit hard to get on, but it's alright. I love the different sizes, and there is great variety. they look great, and are very round and sharp. great product!!",5
B08S7HR1BG,Just what I was looking for. Priced right,5
B08S7HR1BG,Just wish the compartments were marked by millimeter. Otherwise large assortment and Acceptable quality.,4
B08S7HR1BG,"Quality is ok, but the sizes aren't specified",3
B08S7HR1BG,good product. but whats the needle for ?,5
B08S7HR1BG,"I use these for crochet projects. I recently received a book of crochet patterns of little amigurumi monsters and purchased these for the eyes. They snap together well as long as pay attention tot the sizes. I mistakenly thought there were only two sizes for the backing pieces and got frustrated when I tried to use the largest eyes for a pattern...then I realized there were, in fact, backings in another size for those eyes. Headdesk moment for me.They've been staying put in the crochet patterns, which was another concern of mine - the holes in some of the patterns between stitches are large enough that I was concerned the eyes would just fall out, but since I tried placing them in the middle of stitches and firmly pressed the backs, they're stuck in there. They projects have come out very cute and the eyes are a big contribution their cuteness. If I run out of these eyes, I will definitely order again.",5
B08S7HR1BG,Good deal for the price but have had several backs that will not stay on.,3
B08S7HR1BG,easy to use.,5
B08S7HR1BG,"While these work well, my one complaint is that the sizes are not listed anywhere in the container/package. Currently I have been coming back to the link to reference the sizes included",4
B08S7HR1BG,This comes with a great selection! It has quite a bit for styles and it even comes with noses which was a nice surprise. The only negative I have is the lack of different size for some of the shapes. The ends can be complicated to put on because they are flimsy but I would 100% buy again!,4
B08S7HR1BG,"I really like everything about this kit, but the one thing that would improve it is somehow labeling the backs as to which sets of eyes or noses they go with. I didn't find that easy to determine as they're very similar.  Overall a good product for the money.",4
B08S7HR1BG,would have been a 5 star rating but original packaging was missing the large washers and the tool. otherwise very easy to use and good quality,4
B08S7HR1BG,"They work and look nice! Took a while to find some we liked, found them here.",5
B08S7HR1BG,Works great with my craft projects,5
B08S7HR1BG,Work well but wish they were labeled and washers were in the case,3
B08S7HR1BG,"I have arthritis in my hands so these are a little difficult for me to use, but I'm sure I will order more of them.",4
B08S7HR1BG,Sizes are not labeled in the container and some compartments are same sizes.. suppose it doesn't matter if you're using by looks on the stuffie alone but it does create a hold up when I am grabbing eyes to install and have to go through each one to make sure the size is what I want and both pieces match.,4
B08S7HR1BG,"These need to have a larger washer for securing the eye or nose. I cut some larger ""washers"" out of a plastic template sheet in order to secure the eyes and noses. The circle washer they include is not appreciably larger than the eye or nose, by the time to poke a tiny hole in the fabric to insert the part, it's already acting like it wants to pop out. Originally I thought that the method to secure these would be to use a template cutting iron and smoosh the end of the eye once it was in place, there by securing it in the fabric. BUT since the washer (plastic circle they include) is so small nothing is secure without using something larger in diameter. I toyed with the idea of using a metal washer, but opted for the plastic template sheet because I had it on hand. I recommend using at least a 1 inch diameter washer of some sort, maybe even larger diameter.",3
B08S7HR1BG,These are really great. So easy to use and look so much better than just buttons.,5
B08S7HR1BG,Lock is sturdy and strong. Very safe and attractive addition to handmade animals for kids and also adults who are kids at heart!,5
B08S7HR1BG,"I used these eyes to make little crochet stuffed animals for friends and family if you are doing the same I recommend using a smaller hook than it says it needs because the eye can get loose and fall out but overall the eyes are sturdy and worth the price the only wish I have is that there were some bigger sizes of eyes for larger animals, but other than that they're great!",4
B08S7HR1BG,Great,5
B08S7HR1BG,These are perfect for your next crochet project. You just pop them through and put a cap on the back. They are in snuggly and the size variety makes sure that you can find true perfect fit. They have a really great shine to them that gives a realistic eye flint to them.,5
B08S7HR1BG,I bought these for my daughter who crochets stuffies. They eyes are easy to use and were a great price for the whole pack.,5
B08S7HR1BG,It works okay but it does end up falling out of the crochet projects.,3
B08S7HR1BG,"They seem very nice. I am new to amigurumi and would have hoped there would be some instructions included. But no, it's just a box of pieces.editing my review as they read my review and were kind enough to offer refund and did send me a sheet that was actually an inventory rather than instructions. But i do see the instructions on how to use them on the amazon page selling the item.Very responsive customer service and the pieces do all do look very nice. I am looking forward to using them.",5
B08S7HR1BG,,5
B08S7HR1BG,Excelente producto.,5
B08S7HR1BG,Thanks for fast shipment and great item,5
B08S7HR1BG,I have actually loved these. They are really easy to use. I put them into crocheted animals. I like that it has eyes and noses for different projects. My kids have been playing with their animals for months and I haven't noticed any signs of them not staying in or wear to them. They look just as cute as the day I put them in.,5
B08S7HR1BG,Exactly what I needed good quality,5
B08S7HR1BG,"Easy to use, just wish they were separated by size instead of all mixed together and have to measure to use the correct size for projects.",5
B08S7HR1BG,"I primarily bought these to make some teddy bears on my Addi Express. They do what they should, they are easy to install onto the finished pieces of the teddy bears, and the shine is perfect to give the teddy bears life.  The price of the box is also great with getting so many different eyes and noses for the projects you will use them for.",5
B08S7HR1BG,"This is my first order of any safety eyes at all, but had I known that no sizes were labelled and that the backs were not in a box, their in a tear apart bag. They do provide some zip locks for them, but if you want instructions as to which back is for which eye you need to look on the amazon description.  I would have looked for something else that would have been labelled and be easier to keep together. I will keep these and try to figure them out because I have been waiting for safety eyes for a few days and don't want to bother sending them back.  The price is inexpensive, thats a plus.",3
B08S7HR1BG,So nice to have this as I try out making different little crochet buddies!,5
B07KPB38LK,"I've been making vinyl things for over 5 years and this is BY FAR the BEST transfer material around. It's better than Circuit hands down. I've never had an issue with residue like I have with others, the peeling is never an issue like it is with circuit paper. the size is perfect for the price, the durability is a great quality, I've had circuit transfer paper rip when peeling it off vehicles which is a pain. I actually ran out of this which lasted me a very long time and I had to use other transfer tapes, I've used clear tack from Walmart (bc I didn't have money at the time from having cancer) and I had some other ones and nothing compared to this brand, I actually had to use goo gone on a vinyl decal I had made for my vehicle because of all the residue that was left behind and ended up collecting so much dirt, the decal went from white to dirt colored REAL fast, and I was working 60hrs on third shift so it stayed that way for a week, it was gross lol. This product is 10 out of 10 hands down!",5
B07KPB38LK,Very sticky and works greats! Worth the month and love how clear it is with the lines. Makes placement much easier.,5
B07KPB38LK,"Using this clear vinyl transfer tape has seriously stepped up my crafting game! The alignment grid on the tape made positioning a breeze, especially for decals and stickers that need precision. I was able to lay out my designs perfectly on windows and signs without any fuss. The 12 x 50 ft roll gave me plenty to work with, and it peeled off smoothly without damaging my projects. Works great with my Cricut and Silhouette Cameo too!",5
B07KPB38LK,Gets the job done. Great Price. Just be advised it is light tack barely sticks to the paper backing.,4
B07KPB38LK,"This is amazing! First, the roll is longer than expected and the quality is great. Second, I had a fairly small project but had to transfer 50 images  - 4 words each. I didn't want to cut 50 transfer tape shapes and then have to peel the tape from the backing. I used each piece at least 4 times. It worked so well. The stickiness was still there enough to lift the vinyl from the backing. I transferred to glass. It held shape enough to not flop down and I could easily have all images align.",5
B07KPB38LK,THIS IS THE EASIEST STUFF TO WORK WITH.  IT IS LINED WHICH MAKES ALIGNING YOUR TRANSFERS UP EASILY.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.  THE ROLL IS LARGE ENOUGH THOUGH THAT I DONT KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE I NEED MORE LOL.,5
B07KPB38LK,This works SO well! It comes with such a large amount and it is so easy to use!!!!!,5
B07KPB38LK,"I tend to have to fight with transfer tape but this one requires little effort, fyi I don't use it for HT vinyl but permanent and it works great.",5
B07KPB38LK,"I love this! I find it much easier to work with than the ""name brand."" I am also able to reuse it multiple times!",5
B07KPB38LK,This transfer tape works perfectly.  I wish I discovered it sooner.,5
B07KPB38LK,Did the job great quality,5
B07KPB38LK,Works great for projects,5
B07KPB38LK,Good quality,5
B07KPB38LK,This is the only transfer tape I use since buying it. Works perfect and you get a lot.,5
B07KPB38LK,Works perfect,5
B07KPB38LK,Great product,5
B07KPB38LK,Perfect!,5
B07KPB38LK,Transfer tape is thin and great quality,5
B07KPB38LK,"Good product, cheap price",5
B07KPB38LK,Great product,5
B07KPB38LK,Works great. I have had great feed back from people on transferring their decals.,5
B07KPB38LK,This is easy to use and very cost effective.,5
B07KPB38LK,I like the quality of the material it will be used to make uniforms,5
B07KPB38LK,Works great with my granddaughters cricket,5
B07KPB38LK,Great quality,5
B07KPB38LK,Sufficient amount for the cost!,4
B07KPB38LK,"I like everything about it,my daughter makes her stickers",5
B07KPB38LK,"I got a batch of cheap stuff for my Cricut and the transfer paper was literal garbage. So I read reviews and got a roll of this. It's perfect in every project I've used it for, and there's 50 feet of it so it'll last me a long, long time. I'm well pleased.",5
B07KPB38LK,Does have some static though so be careful when placing,5
B07KPB38LK,"I've tried several different brands of transfer paper and this is absolutely the best I've used. Somehow, it is the perfect stickiness for easily pulling the vinyl from it's backing, and then the perfect un-stickiness when leaving the vinyl on it's intended object! Little pieces stay where they're supposed to and transfer perfectly. Plus I love the red grid which is easy to see and is so handy for getting the vinyl straight. Two thumbs up! More if I had 'em!",5
B07KPB38LK,Weeee doggy,5
B07KPB38LK,Love this brand. Great price and quality. Definitely recommend !,5
B07KPB38LK,This is my favorite transfer tape to use with my vinyl!  It's so easy to remove once you place your vinyl where it goes.  Others brands aren't so easy to remove.  I strongly recommend this one!,5
B07KPB38LK,Used this with my vinyl the other day for a near flawless transfer. I was really happy with it! Fast shipping and great value!,5
B07KPB38LK,"I am a total Cricut newbie having owned my machine for two years and only taking it out of the box for the 3rd time recently.  Part of it is my inexperience working with vinyl.  After watching countless tutorials and reading many, many reviews, I decided on this product, the YRYM HT Clear Vinyl Transfer Paper Tape Roll.  Probably overkill for the size of the roll considering this would be my first time working with vinyl but it did not disappoint.  I made myself take out the machine to make new price signage for my pop up booth because I got tired of the chalk ones getting ruined and having to repeatedly remake them after they got rained on.  As other reviewers have stated, one piece of transfer paper from this product could be used multiple times and it did not disappoint.  At the rate that I am going using my Cricut machine, this roll will last me into the next lifetime lol.  In a nutshell, I am happy with this product and have no regrets.",5
B07KPB38LK,"The old one seems like it was much better quality, this one is extremely hard to get off the backing and is a lot thinner. Still works but just seems very thin",4
B07KPB38LK,Sturdy transfer tape. Not flimsy like some others.,5
B07KPB38LK,This stuff is awesome for my vinyl decals,5
B07KPB38LK,I love this transfer paper. The grid lines help everything line up and its easy to transfer my designs.,5
B07KPB38LK,Fast delivery and the product is easy to use,4
B07KPB38LK,Great for projects needing to be removed to place on certain beautiful art projects.,5
B07KPB38LK,Love it,5
B07KPB38LK,"great product, will buy again",5
B07KPB38LK,This stuff works great!  I like it even better than the cricut brand - so much easier to work with.,5
B07KPB38LK,I went through a couple rolls of this transfer paper so far it's been quite good quality for the price and I plan to purchase it again when I need more,5
B07KPB38LK,"Easy to use, love the guide lines, last a very long time",4
B07KPB38LK,"Very nice transfer vinyl. Huge roll, easy to see lines, good thickness, always works very well.",5
B07KPB38LK,Bought this for a  fraction of the price of Cricut vinyl transfer paper.  I used it for an outside application (logos on doors and mirrors to my new business) and I couldn't be happier.,5
B07KPB38LK,Very new to using vinyl transfers... product is a HUGE game changer! It is a time and frustration saver when trying to get the transfer in the right spot with the right spacing!,5
B07KPB38LK,Great product,4
B07KPB38LK,Love the lines to help set vinyl straight!,5
B07KPB38LK,"I'm very new to this.  In fact, today was the first time I attempted a vinyl transfer project using a Cameo.I know if was a bit aggressive, but I started with a fairly intricate design with a lot of small detail.  According to all of the tutorial videos I watched, it was the exact opposite what they recommended for a ""first project"".  But I figured... ""what the heck"".Being so new, there are a lot of places this could have gone wrong.... I won't bore you with that list.  But at the end of the project, it all went perfectly.I wasn't sure how this transfer paper tape was going to work.  But I applied it to my transfer as instructed.  The transfer lifted from it's backing without any problems.  I then applied the transfer to it's destination surface as instructed.  Again everything went perfectly and my vinyl image was left on the desired surface.I actually had so much luck with my first attempt that I did it again... even using the same piece of transfer tape.  The second time, the transfer tape worked just as well as the first.  It clung to the vinyl when I needed to, and it released the vinyl when I needed it to.I'm very happy with the whole process, and this product.",5
B07KPB38LK,"I love the grid lines but OMG the STICKINESS!! This may be  good for better quality vinyl with better adhesive but you will NEVER get it to release your design on another surface using Dollar Tree vinyl.  The difference in adhesion is just too drastic. I was trying to put DT vinyl on a painted wood surface. The swearing finally stopped when I switched to Press n Seal.  No matter what brand of vinyl, do NOT use this to transfer to paper, cardboard or other surface that is not inherently durable.",3
B07KPB38LK,"Works great, sticks well and it's very convenient that there are checkered markings! Will buy again when my roll runs out.",5
B07KPB38LK,"Really like this. Good adhesive, helpful measuring-cutting lines and it has a paper cover, which provides rigidity when pulling and lets you roll over to ensure adherence to the mat. The other brand with ""Man"", very popular here, is garbage. Glad to have found this.",5
B07KPB38LK,great would buy again,5
B07KPB38LK,I like the way this transfer tape performs. It really adheres to the vinyl really well.  I'd bought 3 boxes. Love it.,5
B07KPB38LK,I have used and LOVED this transfer tape for years. That is until my last order arrived. The paper backing is now super thin and hard to separate from the tape. Used to be able to fold a corner and it would easily separate. Not anymore! Sometimes change is not for the better. Terribly disappointed.,3
B07KPB38LK,Works great and was a great price. I love the grid to help keep things lined up.,5
B07KPB38LK,Great paper-BUY it-on time,5
B07KPB38LK,I recently started using my Cricut and had trouble keeping the vinyl on canvas bags so I will try this. There should be enough on the roll to to a lot of things with it.,5
B07KPB38LK,Love this transfer tape!,5
B07KPB38LK,Loved it the first time bought so I bought again. The thickness of the film and backing paper has been reduced. I would gladly pay another $10.00 for this product if they would return to the original thicknesses.,3
B07KPB38LK,"I like this transfer tape for use with my vinyl projects. It sticks well to the vinyl and easily transfers to my projects. It's a BIG roll, so it lasts me a very long time. I use pieces until they don't stick anymore so I get the most out of it. I can stick and restick a vinyl over and over with this and it stays sticky for several transfers, not just one and done.",5
B07KPB38LK,"I have tried many brands of transfer paper , but this is the best there is. It holds really well, doesn't loose its strength,  you can use a sheet for atleast 10 + times before it starts to not be sticking. Love it !",5
B07KPB38LK,Love this transfer time. Easy to use. most definitely will buy again. Peeling off the tape is a Breeze. You get the most for your money. Also it's a great price.,5
B07KPB38LK,It has strong hold but easy to peel.,5
B07KPB38LK,"To save money, I had been buying rolls of transfer tape at  dollar store. There is so much more tape for the money on this roll and it is good transfer tape, too.",5
B07KPB38LK,Easy to use. It had just the right amount of stickiness. It picked up my lettering no problem and I was able to transfer the words no problem. Best transfer tape I have used. I just cut a piece the size I needed and I was able to reuse some of the tape pieces. Worked great!,5
B07KPB38LK,Works fine and would order again,5
B07KPB38LK,Never had an issue with any projects works flawlessly if you use it correctly.,5
B07KPB38LK,Very sticky! almost a bit too sticky. If using on a painted door be very careful when lifting transfer paper off it might lift the paint.,4
B07KPB38LK,Great price for the value,4
B07KPB38LK,"World like a charm, not overly sticky, but just the right amount. Will buy it again for sure!!!",5
B07KPB38LK,"I use this to transfer vinyl.  I'm used to using the type of transfer tape that is like a thin sheet of masking tape.  I found this to be a bit too sticky.  If a corner dropped onto my vinyl before I was read, the fight was on to get it off without pulling the vinyl up and ruining my design.  I found it to be a nightmare with Oramask 813 stencil film (which isn't a very sticky vinyl already) and had to switch to Oracle 851 for stenciling (no 831 on hand).  This transfer tape would pull the 813 off my board so removing the transfer tape from the item it's transferring became difficult and defeated the purpose.  After switching to 851 it was still a pain but I was able to further combat this problem a bit by first sticking the transfer to around my leg on my jeans a couple of times.  For my vinyl stencil applications, no big deal.  The transfer tape was still extremely sticky.  Because of it's thickness, I also found that it wasn't very forgiving if it didn't get smoothed out perfectly (say you were working with one side while the other dropped too soon - it's so sticky that it grabs really well).  I'd never consider using this transfer tape again if it wasn't for the most redeeming quality of that this material is so thick it does not tear, bunch up or fold like the other transfer tape does.  Because of this it's completely reusable!  I was able to knock out a bunch of serving platters of the same size with the same transfer tape!  That will add up to a considerable cost savings in the long haul.  I had less troubles as I went, just had to readjust the way I use it but also the more I used the same piece it became less adhesive but to the perfect amount.",4
B07KPB38LK,So economic on price and supper easy to transfer the vinyl anywhere. Will buy again for sure!,5
B07KPB38LK,This transfer paper is amazing! I've been struggling with the cricket transfer paper and decided to give this a try. So glad I did!,5
B07KPB38LK,Other 1 star reviews are right. This stuff is like cement and has ripped up the poster board I have tried to put it on. Seems like it would be better for other surfaces.,3
B07KPB38LK,I used this transfer vinyl for a project and worked very nicely. Did not leave any adhesive behind like some transfer vinyl that I have used in the past. Will definitely purchase and use again.,5
B07KPB38LK,great product...... recommend,5
B0013CDGT6,"It lasts longer than other brands, saves well and works for all mild crafting projects.",5

B0013CDGT6,Not much to say here this is a box of glue sticks.... they all work as intended and have been very helpful for the classroom!,5

B0013CDGT6,Product is great!,5
B0013CDGT6,"These Elmer's glue sticks are just what I needed.  They arrived solid and were not melted and sticky.  I was amazed that 30 glue sticks arrived in perfect shape.  The important thing is that the glue sticks to the paper, and things stay where we put them.",5
B0013CDGT6,Bought these to use for the grand kids school supply lists and church Sunday school. Very cost effective buying in bulk.,5
B0013CDGT6,"I bought this because I hear that teachers need to buy supplies for their students when parents don't.  So, I wanted to help",5
B0013CDGT6,I ordered these in clear and it threw my students off since they were so used to the purple glue. But they worked out really well and they lasted for a few durations of use. My kiddos can be rough and tumble with glue so these lasted longer than I expected.,5
B0013CDGT6,Amazing Product !!!,5
B0013CDGT6,"I got a good deal, donated them to coworkers. Trusted and durable brand",5
B0013CDGT6,"I like these glue sticks. I use them often, so it is convenient to buy them in bulk. I would buy this again when I run out.",5

It was missing 13 glue sticks.  I don't have time for a refund, as I said, I needed them asap.  I will not order these again.",4

B0013CDGT6,Not much to say as they are Glue Sticks. I ordered this cause the price was amazing and I will donate it to the school. Exactly what it says it is. Great product and amazing price.,5
B0013CDGT6,My first great granddaughter needed 30 Elmer's glue sticks and that is what arrived,5
B0013CDGT6,I sell a lot of Player Piano Music on floppy disk and I use these to make sure the Labels I attach to the floppy stay on. If the edge curles up then they get stuck inside the floppy so when I use the glue stick they NEVER curle up and get caught in the drive.,5
B0013CDGT6,Always need for school so a great way to stick up and not have to keep buying. Great deal!,5
B0013CDGT6,I need glue sticks for school and bought a 30set for my 2 kids. Combined they required 10 glue sticks so I ended up purchasing this one as it was on sale. It should last the whole school year for them.,5
B0013CDGT6,They are part of our annual school supply donation to local schools.,5
B0013CDGT6,"My students told me these are the best glue sticks and requested I buy only these. They paste vocab pictures in a notebook, so they need them to stay in place to study. These sticks do that.",5
B0013CDGT6,Great. Donated to school drive,5
B0013CDGT6,I donated them to local schools,5
B0013CDGT6,Elmer's glue is the best! I like the stick factor- very durable,5
B0013CDGT6,"There's some kind of sorcery afoot!  Glue in a stick!?  What craft fair wizard came up with this!?  Thank you, Elmer, you gluey old playground lurker!  No longer will I have to murder a horse and boil down its connective tissues for hours just to stick two pieces of paper together!  And I'm not a very good glue-maker either, so I need about three horses to make a teaspoon of glue.  But this stuff is amazing!  I pop off the cap, twist it like a lipstick, and I've got glue!  Additionally, as a child, I was quite the little paste eater, so these glue sticks are great for a snack on the go!  It's like my very own paste-pop!  I'm just so excited about this product!  In fact, i was so excited, I needed some glue remover to tear my eyes away from the screen!  WOW!  Look at all those exclamation points I'm using!  And I've found dozens of uses for my glue sticks, too...  They're great for thickening soups and stews, sticking googly eyes on pictures or Barack Obama, throwing at kids who won't get off my lawn, bribing police (you don't know how many tickets I get out of...  cops LOVE glue), and my personal favorite, holding my wife's bosom together so she looks like an adult film star!  Buy this glue stick and your dreams will come true!  Unbeknownst to most purchasers, each stick of glue comes with three wishes.  just take off the top, rub the glue stick, and a glue-genie comes out.  For my three wishes, I asked for more glue, a meeting with Elmer himself, and the resurrection of the 1,787 horses I'd murdered over the years while making my own glue.  Well, I hope my review helped!  I'm off to enjoy a hot cup of tea and a tepid stick of Elmer's glue!",5
B0013CDGT6,I love catching these on sale. They are great quality and helps the teacher keep stock!,5

B0013CDGT6,I love this pack for my classroom!,5
B0013CDGT6,As expected,4
B07QQ3L753,"I was looking for a heavier weight paper to make envelopes for handmade cards. Most of my cards have layers and embellishments that require a slightly heavier envelope to make it through the mail unscathed. Embellishments in particular can poke through standard envelopes, which can cause unsightly dents or even tears. This index cardstock holds up much better and offers more protection. It's not as heavy as the cardstock needed for card bases, but it's a little heavier than layering cardstock. It works great in my envelope punch and folds easily and crisply with a scoring tool and a bone folder. The envelopes end up have a really smooth, substantial feel without weighing so much that I need to add extra postage. I've also started using this paper to line the insides of my cards and sometimes for layering to keep weight down on a card front. I love that I can get a generous amount at once because I use it every time I craft.",5
B07QQ3L753,"This Neenah White Index paper is a solid choice for everyday printing needs. The mediumweight 199 gsm stock feels substantial and offers a smooth, crisp finish. Printing text and images looks sharp, and the brightness level is perfect for everyday documents. The generous 300-sheet count makes this a cost-effective option for home or office use.",5
B07QQ3L753,"This product is a great value for the money, is made of great quality, is the perfect size thickness of card stock, is printer compatible & prints great! This is my second time purchasing this product & I will be purchasing this product again in the near future! I highly recommend this product also!",5
B07QQ3L753,Excellent cardstock but definitely light weight.  Does not cut well in electronic cutting machines.,5
B07QQ3L753,"This ""cardstock"" worked for what I needed it for, but they are not as thick as actual cardstock like you would purchase at Michaels. If you want to print business cards, I would not purchase this. I used it to print out ""birth certificates"" for stuffed animals for kids to create.",4
B07QQ3L753,"This is my go to cardstock for my sticker backing, thank you cards and my bookmarks. I have saved so much on ink by using the plain paper, thick and best setting on my HP printer. The colours come out so vibrant in this setting. Other brands I have tried I have had to use the Matte, Best setting and you lose alot of ink this way. BUY this cardstock if you want to save on ink. Great value and savings!",5
B07QQ3L753,"Love this cardstock for making cards with. Markers just glide over the smooth texture. The weight is not too flimsy nor too stiff to make layered cards. Folds without tearing, and it is very white in color.",5
B07QQ3L753,I order this cardstock paper regularly for printing marketing material. I think the value weight of the paper is just right and the quality is good. The price point is also good for the amount of paper that you get with this order.,4
B07QQ3L753,Perfect for flyers and price sheets!,5
B07QQ3L753,I love them and I would buy more.,5
B07QQ3L753,I purchase this paper repeatedly for my small business! My printer prints on this paper beautifully and the thickness works well for creating garlands.,5
B07QQ3L753,excellent paper texture and whiteness,5
B07QQ3L753,"I really like this cardstock paper, I was skeptical at first. But after trying it out on this drawing I pictured here I can say this paper is great quality. Holds color well without bleeding and the smoothness of using markers is a plus. Definitely gonna keep getting this kind.",5
B07QQ3L753,This is my most favorite cardstock  .. cuts beautifully in my cameo. Those saying it doesn't.  Change your settings. Prints beautifully.,5
B07QQ3L753,Exactly what I needed at a great price,5
B07QQ3L753,Great quality paper at a great price.,5
B07QQ3L753,"I use this cardstock to create templates for cutting fabric for my quilting projects. I print the templates to the correct size and use double-sided tape to attach them to freezer paper. This allows me to reuse the templates multiple times. When the freezer paper loses its grip, I simply transfer the template to a new piece of freezer paper and continue cutting. This technique helps me maintain accuracy in cutting out the templates and also makes it easier to keep track of the pieces I've cut for sewing together. The thickness of the cardstock ensures that the templates maintain their shape, which contributes to the accuracy of the quilt blocks.",5
B07QQ3L753,Nice and sturdy for junk journaling embellishments.,5
B07QQ3L753,I was looking at a lot of diffrent pricing and types of cardstock paper and this one came with the most at an affordable rate. Great pricing and the paper is perfect for my cards. It also has never jammed my printer like other cardstock papers.,5
B07QQ3L753,I am absolutely in love with this card stock! This is my go to card stock for all projects. The quality of it is great. I use it with my cricut to create fun banners and cards  and my daughter uses it to paint. When she paints on it the paint does not leak to the other side. It is a nice bright white can be used for multiple projects.,5
B07QQ3L753,Pleased,5
B07QQ3L753,"Last year was the first time I ordered this cardstock for class. I was reluctant at first because it's not my usual brand. However, due to the quantity and the price, I bought it. THIS IS IT! The quality is amazing especially when you must make copies for 200 students. We did an activity in September and the paper quality lasted the whole year while it was hung up on the board. I'm sure this will work great for those who are into arts and crafts. This is my second time purchasing it. It definitely won't be my last.",5
B07QQ3L753,A couple of pouches wrinkled and bubbled...but that could have been due to the extreme heat wave we had.,4
B07QQ3L753,"I create greeting cards and notepads at home and had run out of cardstock so this puts me in a bit of a pickle.  The cardstock arrived with one corner on eachsheet damaged, all the way to the last sheet.  I opened it already.  No way it could have been damaged in shipment as it was safely inside a box with other items I ordered.",3

YAY!It makes me happy!Thank you so much for providing such a high quality product at a reasonable price!",5
B07QQ3L753,Works great for our printer and is the perfect thickness. Love how affordable it is for having more paper than normal.,5
B07QQ3L753,Good for printing music and other things on.,5
B07QQ3L753,It is completely compatible with my HP 2724 printer and my Hallmark card software.,5
B07QQ3L753,"I have been using Neenah for two years now and it is the best brand of cardstock for the best price and quantity! It is thick, the brightness is regular white and it is easy to fold! The texture is smooth!",5
B07QQ3L753,Best quality for the price,5
B07QQ3L753,I have previously bought a different brand of this weight and gsm but this was much thinner. Was disappointed since it had good reviews!!,3
B07QQ3L753,"Great print quality, good for paper printables",5
B07QQ3L753,This is not a 100lb cardstock. It's only about a 65lb if it's made. Cuts really well. Needs to be listed as 65lb cardstock.,3
B07QQ3L753,Fast shipping. Would recommend. Will purchase again.,5
B07QQ3L753,I cut in half : you need a good paper cutter .  Just the right thickness and appearance is very good and folds nice and extremely affordable compared to the pre folded cardstock.  Texture is good for cardstock,5
B07QQ3L753,"LEARN FROM ME!Any greeting card maker knows you need the heaviest cardstock you can get your hands on. Neenah is recommended by all makers, including me, but my last order was a big, 110 lb mistake. I had no idea there was a difference to watch out for.Yes, look for 110 lb but it's meaningless without looking at the GSM too. This paper is the Neenah 110 lb INDEX with a GSM of 199. It is flimsy and doesn't hold up for serious card making. It's the  Neenah Classic Crest 110 lb COVER with a GSM of 297 that makes ALL the difference! It is a beautiful, smooth, sturdy paper that can handle everything from ink to watercolor to layer upon layer of glue. And this is also why one package has 250 sheets vs the higher quality, thicker paper that only has 125 sheets.Yes, despite negative reviews, the advertising for this paper is correct and true however it would help if the differences between the two paper types were clearly explained. So please, learn from my mistake.",5
B07QQ3L753,Feeds into our older inkjet printer easily. Handles the ink without bleeding into the back to allow double sided printing which saves money.,5
B07QQ3L753,"I have used this ""index paper"" for both printing photos and making handmade greeting cards. It is smooth and holds ink well. No jams in the printer and no issues with my pens/markers catching on the surface or bleeding through. It is thicker and sturdier than other card stock I have used and the pack is larger as well. Highly recommended for your paper craft needs.",5
B07QQ3L753,"I'm a caricature artist, and traditionally I've used paper that's cheap and comes in high volumes, but is flimsy and will wrinkle and tear easily, not to mention being in odd sizes that are hard to frame.  So for my gigs, I was looking for a more heavy duty, standard size paper that won't buckle or wrinkle from permanent marker ink.  The famous animator and character designer Stephen Silver turned me on to cardstock printer paper, and I found this brand on Amazon.It's indeed sturdy, and resists wrinkles, tears, and takes permanent ink very well.  It's also a convenient size that my clients can easily frame.The only criticism I have is that the smoothness is inconsistent between packs.  Some packs have a rougher tooth than others.  But this most recent ream is smooth, and my marker glides over it very nicely.And for the price, which is usually discounted here on Amazon, this paper easily pays for itself.",5
B07QQ3L753,"I love this paper. It is wonderful for working with most types of mediums. I use for painting pictures and making greeting cards. I have had trouble with other paper because it was not white, the other often had a grey tint but Neenah white is very white. It will take alcohol markers, stamping with die and pigment inks, watercolor pencils and watercolor paints. Watercolor paints work better with water color paper if you want to use real water color techniques though. Strong enough to stand on it's own and takes scores well, with no cracking.",5
B07QQ3L753,We wont run out as easily. I did like the quantity although I wished sheets would of been a little thicker.,4
B07QQ3L753,Fir the amount it offers,5
B07QQ3L753,Cardstock can be very expensive and this ream was much cheaper than even at our local Walmart for half the sheets.  I make a lot of game pieces using cardstock and this paper is great for that.,5
B07QQ3L753,Great paper for my art prints !!,5
B07QQ3L753,"I've seen a few reviews on here saying that this paper makes business cards a little flimsy and I agree with that. I don't think this would be idea if you are looking for that stiff business card feel. With that said, if you run an online business and are looking to place business cards with the items that you sell I would highly recommend this card stock. I think that it holds up well and my business logo showed up really well and looks professional. I think that despite them being a bit flimsy they woukd be okay to hand out as business cards, but I would personally get something a bit thicker for that purpose.",5
B07QQ3L753,"This is a nice light weight card stock that I like for printing templates like boxes, foldable type things that need a little stability.  I finally found a printer that takes 110 LB & I'm elated to use all the different types of card stock now for different things.  This weight is nice for simple journaling spots / cards / tucks, and good for even sturdier pages in my journal.  It coffee dyes nicely, and I use it more now that I have a printer that can shoot it straight through from the back.",5
B07QQ3L753,Create cards made easy. Great product,5
B07QQ3L753,"The paper is great for cardmaking, stamping and die cutting needs. Very nice quality, color and weight and it is hard to tell the difference between this brand and top designers paper for much more money.  Excellent option in color and quality for use in paper crafting. Color is subjective and this color of white is comparable to some of the most expensive name brands on the market for use in paper crafting!",5
B07QQ3L753,"Bought this cardstock to make business cards and flyers, great quality",5
B07QQ3L753,"I love this card stock and have ordered several,times! A",5
B07QQ3L753,I absolutely love the quality of this card stock paper.  It prints great and holds up.,5
B07QQ3L753,Great quality. Have ordered 3 reams and I will order again! Thick but not too thick it jams a printer.,5
B07QQ3L753,ok,5
B07QQ3L753,"I recently purchased the Neenah White Index Cardstock, and I must say, I liked it a lot! This pack of cardstock sheets has proven to be a versatile and high-quality addition to my crafting and office supplies. The thickness and weight of the cardstock are perfect for a variety of projects. At 110 lb/199 gsm, the sheets feel sturdy and substantial, making them ideal for creating durable materials such as business cards, thank you cards, presentation covers, flashcards, and more. They have a nice heft to them, giving my projects look and feel professional. I'm glad I found it, and I will definitely be purchasing more when I run out.",5
B07QQ3L753,Our son likes to draw with permanent ink markers and this weight is perfect for not bleeding through!,5
B07QQ3L753,Great Quality and cheaper than Walmart.,5
B07QQ3L753,Acceptable bright white paper,4
B07QQ3L753,"I was able to print this paper successfully with a rear loading tray on a canon pixma that prints photos. if you have a printer where it loads the paper from the bottom and makes it roll up, it will probably jam. It jammed up when I tried to print from the cassette underneath the printer. I also only printed ONE at a time",5
B07QQ3L753,Quality at a good price,5
B07QQ3L753,I use this cardstock in 6x9 manila mailers to protect items inside the envelope. I fold them in half to create a liner for the envelope and place my small items in between the paper. I have also used them to make paper airplanes for my grandkids! They're great and I would definitely order them again.,5
B07QQ3L753,"I love this paper! It feeds into my press reliably and is a great thickness for greeting cards. The only complaint that I've ever had was how it gets shipped out. 50% of the time i have to throw away a few sheets because they are damaged from Amazon not shipping it in a proper box. And every time they ship it, it seems to be in a different kind of soft mailer. Luckily I always have to trim the edges for my projects, but if I didn't it would be damaged almost every time.",4
B07QQ3L753,"This is great, high quality paper.  Consistent in every way.  However, you have to open it quickly after delivery to make sure it doesn't have bent corners, as it is generally only packaged in a bag and therefore prone to bending if knocked about during transit.  The paper itself is really great, though.  Very bright and smooth.",5
B07QQ3L753,i used this paper to print adult coloring pages and it is fantastic! the print quality was great and the tooth of the paper is awesome to grab the pigment of my pencils. erases well too. i have absolutely no issues with this product and i will be buying again!!!,5
B07QQ3L753,good price,5
B07QQ3L753,"The paper arrived in very good conditions, including the packaging. It's a medium weight cardstock and can be used in inkjet printers. I printed a few calendars and they look good. Of course. it's not like photo paper,  but it does a very good job.",5
B07QQ3L753,"Nice quality, could be a little heavier. Color is nice and clear. Great to use for greating cards.",4
B07QQ3L753,"I got 110lb cardstock to use as a card backer for selling merch with, and needed something sturdier than what I already have.  But somehow this pack is thinner than what I have even though the one I currently have is supposed to be the thinner one.  Its still good cardstock, but its not the right thickness for what I need it for.",3
B07QQ3L753,It doesn't feel as heavy as 110# cardstock but it does work well as a layering weight. It's just a bit flimsy for most card bases. It's smooth so I'll definitely find a use for it.,4
B07QQ3L753,"Don't be fooled, this isn't 110lb Cardstock.  I would estimate that this is closer to 65-80lbs at best.  I bought it because it was cheaper because I new I would need more cardstock in the future but when I opened it today after my current ream ran out I noticed it but by that point its too late to return.  It might be a few dollars more but buy something else.  I guess I got a ream of high quality copy paper...",3
B07QQ3L753,"This isn't for card bases however, it is awesome for mat and layering. It is bright white and not off white which is great. Stamping on this is wonderful because it is smooth. Great for die cutting. I am no artist so I can not speak from a professional standpoint but for my basic needs it works for alcohol colouring. I can even get away with minimal water colouring however, it is not made for water colouring. It will feather with too much water.Some reviews are bad because they probably don't realise it is Index and not Cover. Cover cardstock is for card bases.I love it. You can't go wrong with 300 pages for $15.",5
B07QQ3L753,This is the 2nd time I ordered this cardstock. It is of good quality and good for crafts. The only downside is the plastic packaging. Both times the plastic packaging arrived torn inside the shipping bag. This second one was for my son's teacher/class. I had to reseal the shipping package and give it that way to make sure the cardstock are protected.,4
B07QQ3L753,"I have purchased different suppliers of alleged 110lb paper.  No one is the same.  I needed this for a specific project and it won't be effective. HOWEVER, it is never a waste of paper because I can use for many other things.  I have discovered if it is affordable, it isn't as sturdy.",4
B07QQ3L753,I own my own business and print a lot of product information card. These paper prints on amazing. I also love how bright white it is. This is my go to card stock!!,5
B07QQ3L753,Same as the one I saw in staples and for half the price!,5

B079L16LN6,Scissors are very sharp and durable. Works very well for many different things.  Easy to use.,5
B079L16LN6,"I was able to cut through cardboard with it pretty easily, it feels nice to hold and feels sturdy. It's sharp and is a bit dangerous honestly, I cut myself using it, but the safety is on the user honestly I was just holding the scissors badly.",5
B079L16LN6,Easily cuts through material and paper. Grip is comfortable,4
B079L16LN6,"Garage scissors for packages etc. Excellent, sharp and heavy.",5
B079L16LN6,these are just what I needed; and not too large for my hands!,5
B079L16LN6,"Amazing quality for the price.I was a bit dubious, I have to say, because of the price, I didn't expect them to be that great. However, they are heavy and very sharp. They cut through fabric like butter. Will definitely purchase more to replace my name brand scissors that go dull very quickly.",5
B079L16LN6,"These scissors are sharp, and look like they will remain sharp forever.  I love them.  They are just as good as the scissors that I paid nearly fifty dollars for.",5
B079L16LN6,"I use fabric shears to cut my jeans - I basically cut the bottoms off of every single pair I buy so that they fall where I want them to. I have used many different fabric shears and these are some of my favorite - they cut with precision, stay sharp, and are overall just a nice pair of fabric shears. I would recommend these!",5
B079L16LN6,These are the scissors my whole family loves. I purchased two of them because all of us like them so much. The value you get from these scissors are fantastic. I ordered them in the afternoon and they were on my doorstep that night! Wow! Amazon you sure know how to satisfy people.,5

B079L16LN6,"I have purchased some 10 or 12 of these so far. I have them in drawers in various rooms (because I'm too lazy to go pick up scissors from one room and carry them to another), in the garage, in the bathrooms, in the backyard, in my suitcase... Awesome quality, great cut.",5

B079L16LN6,The 9.5 inch scissors are HUGE and comfortably fit my big mitts. The 8.5 inch are more usual. Both are absolutely excellent scissors.,5

B079L16LN6,so far so good,5

B079L16LN6,My second one. It lasts a long time is strong. I use it daily for over 5 years.,5

B079L16LN6,Easy to cut thick fabric.,5

B079L16LN6,Heavy and sharp.,5
B079L16LN6,"Writing this review after having these for 5 years (and counting). These were my everyday scissors. I'm an everyday DIYer, so every single day I will use these to cut various materials for some random DIY project or just a DIY fix. After all that abuse, the only thing ""broken"" on this is that the red rubber material has started to rub away and peel, but that's about it. They are still my go-to scissors for all occasions.",5
B079L16LN6,The scissors ordered were exactly what we were looking for and expected.,5
B079L16LN6,The scissors are sharp and cut great. The blades are however a bit pitted at some points. This can lead to the blades almost feeling stuck mid cut,4
B079L16LN6,These fabric scissors are the absolute best!  I used these to cut my jeans and they did a great job. The scissors are very sharp.,5
B079L16LN6,These scissors are very sharp.  Don't cut yourself!,5

B079L16LN6,It's hard to be excited about household scissors until you get a pair that is worthy of excitement - and these scissors are worthy!! They're heavy duty and cut well all the way to the tip. I truly am excited to use them. You will be too!,5
B079L16LN6,Sharp and comfortable to use.,5
B079L16LN6,Very durable cuts everything,5
B079L16LN6,"With everything  we spend our money on, who really thinks about sizzors?...I struggle constantly with cutting anything....and continue to purchase cheap sizzors. We'll,  this is the holy grail...solid, sharp, affordable and very high quality....now...they are a bit long for every day use, but they have a shorter size, I just didn't read...this company has great reviews as well.Don't cut your finger and don't run with them!",5
B079L16LN6,Love how sharp they are nice handles but there to tight to cut thru easily. Trying to work handles opening and closeting them trying to make them loosen up.,4
B079L16LN6,"Do your current scissors cut cellophane?  Mine didn't, but these scissors sure do.  Sooo sharp, highly machined and top quality steel.",5
B079L16LN6,High quality.,5
B079L16LN6,Cuts well and comfortable  to use,5
B079L16LN6,They work,5

B079L16LN6,Good value for the quality of the product.,5
B079L16LN6,"Used to cut jeans, worked well.",5
B079L16LN6,"So sharp it cut straight through one of my acrylic nails, which was totally my fault, but the point is they're sharp AF and amazing for any crafting you might do. Best scissors I've ever had",5
B079L16LN6,Very nice!,5
B079L16LN6,Excelente producto,5
B079L16LN6,"Cuts beautifully- thick gift wrap, fabric",5
B079L16LN6,Heavy weight.  Cuts with ease.  Better than expected.,5
B079L16LN6,"Great, solid product",5
B079L16LN6,We used the scissors to trim leather.  Very sharp.,5
B079L16LN6,Cutting my ribbons. I do gift wrapping,5
B079L16LN6,"Got these because Someone keeps taking mine and ruining them lol so these have stayed safe in my sock drawer and only I use them. I have used them for cutting clothing, pictures, paper, string cloth ECT and they work well every time, they are very sturdy and have a nice weight in my hand",5
B079L16LN6,All my scissors seem super dull compared to this one! The cut quality is great! Good size. Comfort grip. Overall great pair of scissors,5
B079L16LN6,The scissors recently arrived. Very sharp. I hope they hold up.,5
B079L16LN6,Nice weight. Crisp cutting,5
B079L16LN6,I needed sharp easy to use scissors for cutting fabric. These are exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use with a grip that fits my small hand.,5
B079L16LN6,Cuts fabric smoothly but scissors is a bit too big for my hand.  This of course is not the fault of the tool,4
B079L16LN6,"These sharp scissors are a great tool for precise cutting, whether for crafting, sewing, or general household use. The blades are sharp and cut through various materials with ease, from fabric and paper to thicker items like cardboard. The ergonomic handle is comfortable to hold, even during longer tasks, and provides good control. They maintain their sharpness well over time, requiring minimal maintenance. Overall, they offer excellent performance and are a reliable addition to any toolkit.",5
B079L16LN6,"Had old scissors that had to chop and eat their way through but these are super sharp and do the job.  Kind of stiff opening and closing, might need break in period.  I'm happy with them.",5
B001GAP4YA,"I'm not an artist or sculptor -- I wanted this to repair breaks in statues, like outdoor statuary.  I had a darling angel, the gardeners knocked over and broke her wing!  This worked great.  It's easy to work with, not too stiff or soft.  I sculpted it with my fingers into the broken part and let it dry.  It dried overnight and turned into like plaster.  I was able to color it with watercolor paint and then I sprayed two layers of fixative over it.  We'll see how it holds up over time and with rain etc.  But I'm please with it for what I wanted.",5
B001GAP4YA,"I'm new to sculpting and I bought this to try my skills in the world of art. It's easy to work with however I learned very quickly that you can't work on a single project for more than a couple hours before the clay starts to dry out. It was quite challenging to work with once that started happening, but I was able to finish my sculpture before it completely dried",4
B001GAP4YA,"i don't do a lot of 3d arts, but this clay made it SO easy. dried sturdy and well, an amazing texture, easy to sculpt and blend. just using water made it so i could blend everything together! plus i just had a lot of fun. getting it off my hands was easy enough with soap and water, but never be afraid to exfoliate when getting clay off. loved it",5
B001GAP4YA,Love this air dry clay.,5
B001GAP4YA,"When I was buying this product, I did not read what it was, I thought it was polymer clay but not air dry clay. When I got this, I was really upset because in the past I have handled air dry clay before and I was not impressed. When I opened it (which by the way I recommend opening it the way the package said) it was very wet and I got scared because I thought when it dried it was going to be cracky, just as other air dry does for me. I was working with the clay and for future reference for anyone buying this product, it is veeeeeeeeeeery messy and I do not recommend this to a little kid because it is very sticky and it is a lot like pottery clay and sticks to everything it touches and leaves a white mark everywhere. At this point I was very disappointed and I really though buying this for 10-11 dollars was going down the drain. When it dried it was a little cracky and whatever crease you leave on there in the beginning will show even including any lumps bumps or etc. It dried pretty good and it dried a lot like pottery clay but not as firm. In the ended up liking it compared to like Crayola or any branded air dry clay. But for me I don't really care for this product to use long term so this product had lost a costemer and I am still switching over to polymer clay.",3
B001GAP4YA,Very similar to real clay.  Love this stuff,5
B001GAP4YA,"This air dry clay is so easy to work with! Great for crafting and sculpting. I made some clay ornaments and painted them with acrylic markers and coated it with UV resin. It's not too sticky, and easy to clean off your hands. While you're working, keep any clay not in use under a damp cloth or in the original packaging in a zip lock bag. I also keep a little bowl of water nearby while I am sculpting so I can keep the clay moist and fill in any hairline cracks as I'm building.",5
B001GAP4YA,"I purchased 2.2 lbs, surprising how very little clay that is!!! Sculpted a squirrel. Enough clay for half of it. Keep in mind a squirrels arms and legs have very little clay, so that tells you how very little product.  That being said, I liked the way the clay felt in my hands, detail ability good, I'm in no hurry for drying so don't know about that yet. I have NO left over clay should the project begin to crack. Will update",4
B001GAP4YA,Easy to work with. Used for clay ornaments with my 10 and 7 year old. They enjoyed the project. The clay was soft. Really sticks to your hands! Protect your working surface. Would recommend.,5
B001GAP4YA,Did notice some cracking could be user error. But really easy to use,5
B001GAP4YA,"Absolutely loved this brand for air dry clay. I am just getting into my sculpting journey and I am extremely satisfied with the outcome of this product. Very easy to handle, dried beautifully:)",5
B001GAP4YA,We also have a tradition of having our babies do a handprint for an ornament and we have always used this clay:),5
B001GAP4YA,Great gift for anyone or for any use to be creative !,5
B001GAP4YA,"I have tried quite a few air dry clays and this one by far has the best finish, also allows for GREAT detail!! Highly recommend!!!",5
B001GAP4YA,"I've just started making small tiles with impressions of dried flowers/plants for a craft project. This clay was easy to shape and roll out and very easy to press flowers into. I softened the edges, mistakes or imperfections with a bit of water and my finger prior to leaving it to dry. The clay dried nicely in open air. I turned it over a few times through the process. I will purchase more in the future.",5
B001GAP4YA,"First time I've ever worked with clay, but I'm happy with the outcome.  Clay handled as expected. After opening, I kept it in a sealable tub and it remained moist and pliable. Will buy again.",5
B001GAP4YA,This paper clay was easy to work with smooth and has a great feel to it. I would recommend putting in a sealed bag or container between uses to prevent drying.,4
B001GAP4YA,"Easy to work with, even as a beginner. The clay is super easy to mold and smooth out. Cleaning up is easy just wash your hands in warm water. Great for making jewelry, I like the variety of colors it comes in as. Super soft clay.",5
B001GAP4YA,i dont work clay but i got this for a friend she used it and said it was easy to work and hardened well.,5
B001GAP4YA,Worked wonderfully for my art project with the kiddos.,5
B001GAP4YA,The DAS Air Hardining Modeling Clay is easy to mold. The clay responds well to kneading and when small cracks form applying slip works very well. When making small solid figurines it is taking 2-3 days to air dry. Do not work under a fan (I am in Florida where we like fans) because that causes premature drying on the surface and cracking can occur. Using a slip made from clay remnants is a great way to attach pieces. Paining on this clay is great. Latex paint adheres and colors pop quite easily.,5
B001GAP4YA,"It's an incredibly versatile air dry clay, works up nicely and is grey when wet and dries white. It carves well. However, when you carve it, you'll find that small intricate details aren't its strong suit and it may flake and cause issues for things like that. I can still recommend as long as you aren't aiming for super intricate detailing. It seems durable.",4
B001GAP4YA,"I have been using DAS and similar products for years. DAS is a economically priced, air dry modeling clay that has allowed me to make wonderful pieces of art. If dried slowly, cracking is minimal. It has been a staple for my mixed media sculptures.",5
B001GAP4YA,"Worked great for my cosplay needs, I have a bunch left over and it's stayed workable in a Ziploc for over a month now. Can't wait to have some fun making something new soon.",5
B001GAP4YA,"It could be great for sculpturing. I purchased it to make ornaments of my baby's footprint. It was hard to get the print without pushing my baby's foot very deep.The color came gray, dries lighter but still not pure white",3
B001GAP4YA,It was really fun to craft with!! I don't know how to use clay but still had a fun time!,5
B001GAP4YA,Like,5
B001GAP4YA,the packet the clay was stored in was sliced and part of it was dried when it arrived,3
B001GAP4YA,"I use paper clay in moulds for crafting. This works much better than another brand I was using, it had less cracking and does not shrink like the other.  This will be my go to from now on.",5
B001GAP4YA,I use this clay in my silicone molds and it works great with minimal cracking.  Better than a lot of paper pulp type clays I have tried.,5
B001GAP4YA,"I bought this after seeing it recommended from a YouTube content provider. It is a good product overall. This review is more directed toward my own experience on the ease of use and should not be seen as negative to the product itself.I have a feeling this product is more geared to someone who has reasonable experience with other types of media, such as clay, cold porcelain, etc. Using this for me was tricky. I found that I needed to moisten the product many times to get it to a consistency to be able to manipulate it. It's helpful if you have a knife or other tool to shear off what amount you need as the Das is a bit hard to just pull pieces off. It has an unadulterated consistency that is reminiscent of paper mache' that is very compact and does not contain much moisture,.One aspect I am not sure of is how you can obtain a smooth surface with this when molding, etc. My test project while moist had faults and lines through it. My second project was to use the Das clay to mold a positive to use as a base. For this, as I had found my test piece, though it dried hard, was not as hard as I had hoped for. To aid this I mixed PVA glue into the clay before pressing it into the mold.It dried much harder but it still had creasing and such, which for this project was fine. The biggest positive of using Das is that you can sand it and paint it with relative ease after it has dried. One thing to note, if you are using it in a mold, it can take many days to fully dry, and pulling it from the mold can be tricky without messing up parts that are still moist.Overall this is a useful product, isn't priced in such a way as to be prohibitive for someone who has never used it to give it a try. In skilled hands, I am sure this delivers end results as shown on the packaging. But if you are a novice like myself, you may want to work up to sculpting with Das.",5
B001GAP4YA,"This clay is super soft, easy to work with, and picks up the details in silicone molds VERY well. It dries perfectly. I just wish it dried super hard so it didn't break, but it IS clay so it's not magic. Have purchased before and will purchase again.",5
B001GAP4YA,The clay is easy to work with and is fun for first projects.  Recommend watching some online videos if using for the first time.,5
B001GAP4YA,Soft and easy to work with . Dries pretty fast .,5
B001GAP4YA,I have not had any issues with cracking when working with this clay although it is an air dry clay I think that it worked perfectly for the artwork that I was doing I would 10 out of 10 recommend.,5
B001GAP4YA,OMG I have never used this product and so happy with it. It was so easy with no cracks. I used cookie cutters and paint pins. Sealed them and hung them.,5
B001GAP4YA,I use this clay in molds and it works really well. Minimal shrinking and cracking. Accepts paint well.,5
B001GAP4YA,I'll update after use but there's no instructions so I must Google.,3
B001GAP4YA,"As an artist, I use a lot of clay in my creations and I have found this to be one of the best!It's soft, moist, and easy to work with. I highly recommend!",5
B001GAP4YA,"I used this to repair a large peice of pottery that was broken in high winds. I used a contrudtion adhesive to glue it back together, then came back with this produst and filled in the cracks and pieces that were damaged beyond repair. I will have to go back with paint and weathering to match the pot, but that would be the easy part, it saved a very expensive pieve of pottery.",5
B001GAP4YA,I used this for an easy craft. It was nice to work with. The project did take a few days to dry. Painted up well.,5
B001GAP4YA,"I am a beginner to working with air dry clay, so I was nervous if I could use the clay for the purposes I had purchased it for.  I have several IOD silicone molds, but I also had a few pieces of thrifted decor that had some small damage, too.  I'd seen a good utube crafter I follow use air dry clay for repairs or to fix small cracks.  I was able to remake a bird's broken tail, repair a couple of chipped figurine Bunny ears, make a new paw for a large ceramic cat, and a new ear on a cute schnauzer shaped terra cotta planter pot all in a few minutes on each repair.  I don't mind that the clay dries white as I plan to chalk paint all the thrifted items anyway.  I did find using a bit of water on my finger helped me smooth the clay as I joined it to the main piece, as well as the next day when the clay was completely dry I could softly sand it using a regular paper type nail file to get the finish even smoother. Just be sure and very tightly close the packaging every time and the clay stays soft.  Just couldn't be easier.  I would buy this brand again, as well as purchase from this Seller.",5
B001GAP4YA,Mi hija hizo figuras hermosas,5
B001GAP4YA,"Versatile and easy to use to create new things and repair old broken ones. No kiln, no glazes or finishes needed. Just air dry and place into use.",5
B001GAP4YA,"Overall, great product! Its nicely smooth straight out of the package, so no need to knead it. As long as it's kept in a plastic bag bewteen uses, it shouldn't dry out. You can make a decent amout of little trinkets with just one package. Great quality for artists of all levels.",5
B001GAP4YA,I use das when I want a firmer clay once dry. Excellent quality product. Great detail from molds and easy to use,5
B001GAP4YA,clay did a great job with my diy bathroom shelf. filled in some old ceramic tiling to add a shelf and it did a great job helping me level out what would've been very hard to level out. 10/10,5
B001GAP4YA,Beautiful color. High quality and easy to work with product. Very easy to use i love that it air dries no baking involved .,5
B001GAP4YA,I don't get as much shrinkage nor do I get cracking. It is lightweight as well. To me there is no smell. It's easy to work with. It was delivered fast too.,5
B001GAP4YA,"I make my own air-dry paper clay for most of my sculptures, but I use DAS for specific elements, as in the legs and hands of my swinging gnomes that I sell at art fairs and wholesale to shops. DAS is great for details. I can roll the legs and make the toes without the clay deforming. However, DAS dries similarly to chalk, so it's fragile. You have to seal it to improve its strength. If I hadn't painted and sealed this particular gnome, and he fell on the floor, his legs would break. None of my paper clay breaks because it's almost like concrete; it just doesn't form details very well. No doubt, with DAS drying like chalk, it does allow easy detailing even after drying, as with drill bits and sanding. One other note: because the ingredients aren't listed, be cautious when sanding. The dust is very fine and can easily get into your lungs. Wear a mask for safety.",4
B001GAP4YA,This clay worked fantastically for some clay projects I did. The package isn't that big but compared to other clay out there this clay is the best!!,5
B001GAP4YA,Hours of fun for the kids and parents too!,5
B001GAP4YA,"Very chalky in texture, doesn't handle details well. It's easy to keep moldable if you spray water while you're working. It doesn't blend into itself very well, so when you're adding pieces it's difficult to get everything to stick together. It hardens in about 2 days depending on the size. Decent for fun projects. I'll try more of a polymer clay next time",3
B001GAP4YA,"It dries fine but if you have any mistakes, it's hard to blend out. Or if you want a hard impression, it's hard to put it in without cutting thru. Basically very little control",3
B001GAP4YA,"the Children love it, lasts forever, easy to maniuplate and shape. Air Dry, big plus.",5
B001GAP4YA,My kid loves this stuff,5
B001GAP4YA,I used this clay for months before I ran out and decided to try something new. It wasn't until I tried out a different brand that I realized how unnecessarily difficult this was to work with and how much it cracks. Wouldn't recommend it to beginners.,3
B001GAP4YA,Perfect for fun crafts!,5
B001GAP4YA,"Best air dry clay that I've purchased so far! Smooth, perfect moistness, air drys almost perfect with little cracking, if any at all.  Jovi comes in 2nd. Temu clay kinda sucks.",5
B001GAP4YA,"This product is just amazing. Best and most inexpensive clay you can ask for. One block of clay can provide so much material for multiple projects or one huge project if you wanted. The foil of the bag is actually quite thick, since I opened it very carefully I was able to continue leaving the clay in its wrapper, properly sealed up, and it didn't dry out. I love that as I make mistakes with my molds and creations, a little bit of water can repair whatever repairs I need with the clay. The kind of pale milky color the clay receives when it's finally fully dry is very nice too. I have not tried painting on my creations yet, but I've seen tutorials of people using this exact clay to paint and it seems very ideal. I highly recommend this clay to everyone!!",5
B001GAP4YA,Many uses in Art and Crafts all levels keep in a container w airtight lid helps sustain life of the clay.,5
B001GAP4YA,I've had this clay before and in my experience it's the  best air dry clay,5
B001GAP4YA,Didn't fully harden when I used it better fir modeling rather then masks,3
B001GAP4YA,"this is the best air clay prduct out there, no cracking and so easy to use perfect every time",5
B001GAP4YA,Good product for art modeling and craft work.,5
B001GAP4YA,"I'm new to sculpting and and was able to make this! Also, it's the same price as my local store so purchasing with the Amazon card gave me a better deal due to the 5% back!",5
B001GAP4YA,Package of clay was received with large slice in wrapper.  Clay inside was dried out.  Shipping package was intact with no damage.,3
B001GAP4YA,"I bought this last package a year ago this August. I hadn't been using it much and needed to recently. I thought for sure it would be dried out and useless, but it was fine. I stored it in it's original package taped closed, placed in a ziplock freezer bag and then placed that in another freezer bag. I used the clay on the models' lips and noses because the features on styrofoam heads are often not all that attractive. I used water on my fingers, smoothing the surface and let dry for a couple of days. I can then go back with various dremel bits and finish shaping to my liking. The edge of the mosaic is DAS pressed into a IOD mold and glued on WHILE STILL WET. That insures it takes the exact shape of the substrate. A few small cracks formed in the cast pieces but in this case it just added to the character of the piece so I am more than happy with how it performed. Last year when I bought this package there were multiple offers for this brand and when I came to purchase more I found only 3 or 4. I'm purchasing today and know that if stored properly it will last a long time. I highly recommend this clay. btw, I did not notice any odor at all.",5
B001GAP4YA,"I wanted to get some clay, and with all the great reviews for this one I thought why not! I made a plant pot and it turned out AMAZING!! Here was my process:1. sculpt it out2. let dry for 1/2 a day, and then filled in any cracks that I saw with clay I mixed with water3. let dry almost completely and then sand4. Seal and let that dry5. Paint and then seal again once the paint was dry6. Done!It worked amazingly and I'm really happy with it! Also if you're looking for a sealant, I'm using DecoArt DS17-9 with this and it has worked amazingly with the clay! It makes a sort of clear ""film"" over the clay that protects it and I think it might even make it waterproof!",5
B001GAP4YA,"Good for modeling, whether adult or kids' work, but I use it for repair of ceramics (a wall clock, a chipped bowl). It's not heatproof, but for items that are decorative, it's easy to approximate the shape of the item, and then repaint with a color that matches.",5
B001GAP4YA,A,5
B001GAP4YA,Great Stuff!,5
B001GAP4YA,"I consider myself to be a bit of a clay snob when it comes to my artwork. I usually prefer high-end clays that are higher quality and I know they will work for what I need. I am not entirely sure what prompted me to buy a cheaper clay but I was not disappointed in it. It's honestly better than some of the other brands I have tried. It models easily and holds on to texture quite well. The only downside I found was that it definitely needs water if you are going to be using this for a larger scale project. I used water on a small paintbrush to cover all of my seams and it worked perfectly, no cracks or anything. Definitely will use again!",5
B001GAP4YA,The package is huge!  Clay is soft & easy to use. Air dries to a hard cast.  Highly recommend.,5
B001GAP4YA,Excited to create something with this clay.  I miss making pots on the wheel so this will be a fun alternative.,4
B001GAP4YA,I'm an artist and use this product for making flower for my mixed media creations.,5
B001GAP4YA,"This is my first time using air drying clay and I've tried a few different brands but so far this is the best ones I have found. Extremely easy to work with, doesn't dry out really fast and lasts a long time. I would definitely give this a try if your looking for a good air drying clay!",5
B001GAP4YA,love it and very easy to work,4
B001GAP4YA,"I like that while using it , it is easy to add to by wetting the dry area! I highly recommend using rubber gloves if using for any extended time, it can cause irritation if not!",5
B001GAP4YA,Kept it moist with a wet paper towel. Perfect for fixing holes and missing pieces of my outside gnomes. Love it.,5
B003A2I4V2,"Great colors, quality, and price! Much better than the overpriced cardstock is stores.",5
B003A2I4V2,"Thick paper, consistent in colors, a few quantity of pages for each shade. If you are wanting more pastel colors though go for a different pack but these are some great basic mid and dark colors with a few light sprinkled in.",5
B003A2I4V2,I bought this a few months ago for using in my bullet journal. Very thick sheets of paper perfect for scrapbooking / journaling. Love the vibrant colors and wide variety of colors as well. Wonderful product! Definitely plan on purchasing again when my original stock runs out.,5
B003A2I4V2,Arrived quickly. Paper of good quality. Great color.,5
B003A2I4V2,"The quality is first rate. I got these to print color coded labels. It features a heavy weight thick paper and very durable.My only two suggestion is that:(1) They should include some kind  of a sleeveand(2) Offer colors as separate options in lower quantity packages. I really don't have uses for every included color in my case and only interested in the colors present in the light spectrum.It is amazing that none of the color coded label holders, papers, etc offer an option for separate colors rather than lots that are randomly thrown together. If you do find individual colors, only certain ones are included or in huge quantities of 100+ which exceeds the needs of many.I am suggesting that kits that are put together should include spectrum of light colors as primary colors and then secondary and tertiary variants of those colors are offered as additional separate lots. That has lot more use than randomly thrown together colors. Better yet, offer to put together your own lot by allowing the buyer to customize the number of each color and pack it up in a sleeve.",4
B003A2I4V2,Cost was great and the quality of pages good. Like the colors too,5
B003A2I4V2,This product is amazing! It is thick and the colors are the perfect brightness! This is great for crafting as well as card making!,5
B003A2I4V2,Perfect to my handcraft san valentin cards. Colorful and good quality.,5
B003A2I4V2,I craft a lot. I love these,5
B003A2I4V2,Great price,5
B003A2I4V2,Nice assortment of colors.,5
B003A2I4V2,Excellent weight for crafts and great color saturation.,5
B003A2I4V2,"This cardboard paper set has been an absolute game-changer for my creative projects! The array of colors is simply stunning - rich blues, fiery reds, lush greens, and more.The quality of this cardboard paper is top-notch. The thickness is just right, providing durability without being too rigid, making it perfect for various crafting endeavors. I've used it for scrapbooking, card-making, and even small DIY projects, and each time, it delivers impeccable results.One of the standout features for me is the versatility. Whether I'm working on intricate designs or simple crafts, this paper never disappoints. It cuts cleanly, folds beautifully, and adheres easily, making every project a breeze.The quantity you get for the price is acceptable - an assortment that lasts for numerous projects.Overall, I highly recommend this colorful cardboard paper set to anyone seeking quality, versatility, and a burst of inspiration for their creative pursuits.",4
B003A2I4V2,"I was hoping for a stronger paper, not bad but not a true card stock.",4
B003A2I4V2,This package of paper is a lot of fun.  I needed it for labels for something for our church bazaar.  I was so pleased to see so many different colors!,5
B003A2I4V2,"This is nice, light weight cardstock.  It comes in a good assortment of colors.  It's useful for crafting, journaling & printing when I want a thicker paper than regular drawing or printer paper.  It's a good value.",5
B003A2I4V2,Perfect for a color coded filing system I am developing.,5
B003A2I4V2,nice,5
B003A2I4V2,"Very bright colors, looks great on my crafts, sturdy, great color selection. Good value",5
B003A2I4V2,"good value and quality of cardstock for the price, sturdy and bright!",5
B003A2I4V2,works great with my cricut machine,5
B003A2I4V2,I started scrapbooking about a month ago and I got some colored paper to add some colorBeautiful color paper,5
B003A2I4V2,Great product!!!!,5
B003A2I4V2,"I purchased these cardstocks to use for my flower pressses,  My current cardstocks are not doing their job properly.",5
B003A2I4V2,"I think this is excellent smooth-surface cardstock.  It's SOLID CORE, so items look much better, whether die-cut, knife-bot, folded, or even torn, and the colors are excellent quality, dense, rich and especially, uniform.  It also glues well.The selection itself is far too heavy on the pinks, although the seems to be a disappointingly-common failing with all variety-packs.",5
B003A2I4V2,Wonderful basic Colors for cardstock. I was very satisfied.,5
B003A2I4V2,Good,5
B003A2I4V2,"I have used this for my papercraft project and it is very easy to work with and cut, but it is still very sturdy. I noticed that some of the pink shades were not exactly what was on the front of the package, but it was not that big of an issue unless you are buying for that one specific color. It is a great value for the number of colors and sheets you get.",5
B003A2I4V2,"I do like this paper. The colors are vibrant and the thickness is good. You can use this in making cards, I do.",4
B003A2I4V2,Held up nicely,5
B003A2I4V2,"Great price. Great variety of colors. Great thickness. I use this a lot for my preschoolers to paint on. They sometimes paint too much in one spot which can cause a hole, but not with this card stock. Highly recommended.",5
B003A2I4V2,Exactly as described!,5
B003A2I4V2,Love the colors  cuts great on my cricuit.  Kids enjoy cutting with scissors.,5
B003A2I4V2,Just started using them seems to be okay,5
B003A2I4V2,"Item received was as described and arrived on time. Was very pleased with selection of colors, but wish it contained a few sheets of white. Cut great on my cricut machine. Would definitely purchase again from this company.",5
B003A2I4V2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Nice smooth paper seems heavier than 65lb can use as card base and really for any paper project! Will be buying more! Great price point!,5
B003A2I4V2,Nice cardstock.  I am a cardmaker and this paper has a nice weight to it.  Would recommend.,5
B003A2I4V2,"I make greeting cards, these are nice papers, not super thick (65lb/176 gsm) but perfect for framing mats behind patterned, inked paper edging and accents.",5
B003A2I4V2,Awesome product as it has almost all the colors I need for crafting,5
B003A2I4V2,"I love this card stock. It's sturdy, high quality and easy to remove from my mat. Highly recommend! Crafters, this is truly amazing!",5
B003A2I4V2,"The cardstock is nice quality, colors however the description reads that there is white paper and there is not.  I needed colors and 1 sheet of white of for a project and would have chosen differently if I knew white was not included.",3
B003A2I4V2,"The colors are rich and vivid. Just the right weight for making classroom projects and games. Will buy, again.",5
B003A2I4V2,Perfect hard-to-find weight for my projects. Will order again.,5
B003A2I4V2,The weight in this paper was exact. The setting on my cricut to cut this weight of card stock was like cutting butter. Colors were flawless and arrived in perfect condition.,5
B003A2I4V2,"Even this I only used two colors so far, this pack of assorted colors was perfect. Will definitely used throughout my sons school year for other arts and crafts. Quality is good, not too flimsy and not too thick.",5
B003A2I4V2,Great card stock. Sturdy an vivid colors,5
B003A2I4V2,She loved them.,5
B003A2I4V2,"I needed heavy weight color card stock, but this one is not heavy weight. It feels like 65 lbs. I will repurpose it for front panels or die cutting.",3
B003A2I4V2,"This collection contains an excellent spectrum of colors, with bright and/or deep hues as necessary.  The paper itself has a consistent thickness of 65lb weight cardstock.  Responds extremely well to standard Cricut cutting process with no edge shreds or tearing when pulled.  Its price and speed of delivery make it a no-brainer good choice.",5
B003A2I4V2,Beautiful bright colors making our crafts and card making fun.,5
B003A2I4V2,"We used these to make pop up cards.  The cardstock is very sturdy and the cards stand up on their own even with several layers of glue and paper glued to the main piece.  I would definitely buy this product again, however I would choose some with less colors or more pieces in the kit so you could make more or bigger crafts all with the same color.  This is clearly a starter pack and was exactly what they advertised and what I wanted.",5
B003A2I4V2,Paper is thicker than what I thought. Beautiful colors.,5
B003A2I4V2,"very nice for crafts, what you would expect",5
B003A2I4V2,"I have bought this set of cardstock a couple of times.  I tried another set last time, but will be coming back to this one next time.  This works great for me.  The colors are beautiful!",5
B003A2I4V2,Exactly as described,5
B003A2I4V2,I like the variety of vibrant colors,5
B003A2I4V2,Used to make cards and crafts with my cricut machine.  Cuts beautiful,5
B003A2I4V2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It's working out well for the project I needed for. No complaints I'm happy overall I would buy it again. Shipping was in a timely manner and I love all the colors not just the ones in the video. Thanks,5
B003A2I4V2,Great assortment of colors BUT not all the papers are 65 lb cardstock.  Some are thinner and different texture (not smooth).  Disappointing that it is not exactly what it says it is.,4
B003A2I4V2,I ordered the brilliant colors for scrapbooking.  This cardstock is very nice weight.  The colors are great.  It works well with my paper cutter and cutting stuff out with my Cricut.  Probably will only buy cardstock from them as they seem to have the best price.,5
B003A2I4V2,heavier than construction paper but it is a lightweight paper...comes in lots of nice colors.  It is perfect for the paper crafts I  want to use it for.  Would buy again.,4
B003A2I4V2,Printing anything on this quality paper produces a spectacular result.,5
B003A2I4V2,This is a nice paper with a great weight. I was looking for a cardstock that had some variety of color to it and was going to be sturdy but yet not so thick it wouldn't work with thin dies. Cuts great.,5
B003A2I4V2,Great product,5
B003A2I4V2,I ordered these to print out some items for my team. They worked great and the colors are so vibrant. Very pleased.,5
B003A2I4V2,"I can't claim to purchase much paper, but I really loved this pack. The color variety is what drew me to this specific one and it didn't disappoint at all. The wide number of colors and shades exceeded my expectations, as they were all very vivid and intense.This was used to make greeting cards during library story time and worked perfect for that purpose. Four sheets of each of the 18 colors was just the right amount to allow for personality in the different shades while avoiding squabbles. The price was also great for a shoestring budget.My only complaint, if I were to have one, was that the white was not a true white. Next to the other sheets in this package, it was just fine. However, I happened to already have some other white card stock on hand (no clue what brand since I didn't purchase it) and next to that, the Wausau white had just a tint of cream to it. Definitely not enough to knock off a star. But if you're looking for true, brilliant, bright white, I thought you should know.",5
B003A2I4V2,It has a good variety of colors but it does take a bit to figure out what settings are best when using a cutting machine,4
B003A2I4V2,"As a starter pack, the colors should be clearly labeled so that I know the name of the color I want to order. I cant figure out which is which. For the most part they seem to be stacked in order (I think), but I am pretty sure I don't have Wisteria and I have an additional faded orange one that is not listed here so I don't have a lot of confidence in the label. It would also be helpful to have a page of all the other available colors included so you can see them with your eyeballs instead of on a screen. Otherwise, the paper works nicely in my Silhouette machine. It cuts very fine designs without tearing or making fuzzy pulp balls under the blade. All in all, I would order again.",4
B003A2I4V2,Just what I wanted.,5
B003A2I4V2,"This is a great selection of colors. I got this cardstock to cut up and make themed bookmarks for the holidays throughout the year, and it has all the colors I need, and then some.Unfortunately, one corner of the package arrived smashed, so every piece of cardstock in this package has a very noticeable crunch mark in the corner. It seems like the packaging should be improved to better protect the product during shipping. The packaging is just thin shrink wrap with nothing around the cardstock to protect it.",3
B003A2I4V2,I got these for scrapbooking and they work great. Awesome colors and good quality.,5
B003A2I4V2,"This is a beautiful collection of colors!  Love the weight, not too heavy, not too thin.  It went through my HP 6978 ink jet printer without a problem.  I will say I like printing on HP matte brochure paper better; as the image is nicer.  I LOVE that it is made in the USA.  So tired of things coming from China.  This is a great value, not so expensive you can't turn your kids loose with it.  Some Neenah products are locally available; but this package is not available at any local retailer.  Highly recommended!",5
B003A2I4V2,Got these to do crafts with my 5 year old.  This is gonna be fun!!!,5
B003A2I4V2,The edges of some of the colors are faded. Otherwise great product.,4
B003A2I4V2,I bought this to make a Thank You card. there was enough color options to try out various configurations and enough of each sheet that if you made a mistake there were a few extra to start over. it's not a super heavy weight paper but it is very similar to what you'd find in a store if you bought a commercially made card.,5
B003A2I4V2,I used this paper for a valentines project and I loved how nice the paper felt and the weight was perfect for what I was looking for,5
B003A2I4V2,Great quality!!,5
B003A2I4V2,Kids liked the colors and had fun making crafts,4
B003A2I4V2,Paper is well made and colors are vibrant.,5
B003A2I4V2,I like it,5
B003A2I4V2,I love the colors and the thickness but I bought this to print on. It jams up the copier each time whether loaded in a drawer or handfed. I was unable to print at all. I will use it for craft projects but disappointed about the printing issue.,3
B003A2I4V2,"Paper is good quality and it is sturdy. Good for glue,glitter, etc",5
B003A2I4V2,"I wasn't sure what to expect for the money but I am very pleased with my purchase.  The weight of the paper is heavy enough for most common projects- cards, envelopes, signage, etc. and the variety of colors is great. Highly recommend.",5
B003A2I4V2,Good quality cardstock. Used it for a toddler craft class and they held up well.,5
B003A2I4V2,I make cards and this Neenah ASTRO designs 65lb card stock is great quality and vibrant colors. Highly recommend this cardstock.,5
B003A2I4V2,"This paper is very vibrant in color and much sturdier than most construction paper I've purchased in the past. Pricey compared to some, but totally worth it.",5
B003A2I4V2,The paper had water damage when I received it. I did not return because I needed for school tomorrow and I can make it work for the project I need to do. Please check that the paper is not damaged before delivering.The box that it came in did not show any water damage.,4
B003A2I4V2,I really enjoyed using these in various card projects. Will definitely purchase again.,4
B09PRCVD17,This scent has the best smell. I have been searching for this smell for a long time and now that I have found it I can once again enjoy it. Bath & Body made a body spray with this scent and now I am going to make wax melts with it. I will buy it over and over again. Highly recommend.,5
B09PRCVD17,"I've bought 3 or 4 of these in the past couple of years and my hair  LOVES it. I mix it 1:1 with argan oil and my hair has gotten noticeably thicker and less brittle. That being said, there is no instant miracle cure to thin/brittle hair (except a wig or hair transplant), so have realistic expectations.",5
B09PRCVD17,"It does the job. But the clove scent not as much, almost thought it was not clove oil. I let it sit for a week, then started to use it again",4
B09PRCVD17,"I add two droppers of this to my dryer balls, and everything comes out wonderfully scented. Use this to avoid the chems and plastic fibers that are in dryer sheets.",5
B09PRCVD17,"This product smells amazing.I brought it because I read reviews that it would make my hair grow. I had to return it. I had it for about maybe a month and as I kept reading different reviews, it said that it would take at least three months to see results. I switched to something else for hair growth, and I sent it back.",4
B09PRCVD17,"The scent was on point and doesn't dissipate quickly. I noticed on one of the bottles the labels are different. Odd. Yet the scent is lemon and one with the different label wasn't as strong. Again, odd.",4
B09PRCVD17,I love the scent! however the glass dropper was broken inside the box. It's a little disappointing... But the scent is wonderful!,4
B09PRCVD17,I finally gave my poor toes a break from always having polish and during that month I put this tea tree oil on them daily and they look so much healthier! Easy to use and really nice results.,5
B09PRCVD17,"Lovely scent, fills up the entire room from the defuser.",4
B09PRCVD17,"While very affordable, I'm not an oil enthusiast so I can't comment on quality or anything. But seems perfectly fine! I'm using it to make hair treatment :)Only complaint is the packaging wasn't very protective for shipping glass/liquid. Sadly my dropper was broken. I didn't need it and the oil bottle itself was intact with no leakage, so overall I'm happy!",4
B09PRCVD17,Tea tree oil is good for a number of things. I use it as a topical antibiotic and t treat bruises. It does have a petsistent odor.,4
B09PRCVD17,I hv a Litter Robot 4 and I put 3 drops in the waste bag that catches the cat poop. ELIMATES NASTY POOP SMELLS!!  WORKS GREAT.  Last a long time. Only hv to add drops 1 time when I put in fresh waste bag. Adding to subscription. Will purchase about every 6 months or more. And bedt part. The orange scent dies not affect my cat. No sneezing coughing or respiratory symptoms.,5
B09PRCVD17,"Within seconds of applying, you definitely feel it. The included dropper makes it easy to apply. A little goes a long way. The scent is quite pleasant. Not overwhelming.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Very happy with purchase.  Use it for dental hygiene, and breath freshener so far.  There are lots of other uses, but have not treid them yet, but will in the future.",4
B09PRCVD17,"The price is great for how big the bottle is. The eye dropper makes it very easy to put the oil where I need it. The smell of the lavender is very nice, the only down fall is the smell doesn't last that long. Other that that, it's a great product and would recommend using it.",4
B09PRCVD17,"I heard about this product so I bought it to test it out, I have been using it for the past 3 months and I am seeing the results, I am happy with it only thing one has to be careful not to let it get on the skin only the nail.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Super aroma, very strong and flowery. Chamomile in greek stands for earth apple and it indeed have some apple hints and a smell just like roman chamomile plants I bought. Unfortunately during summer these plants started to smell like german aka common chamomile and they also look too simmilar. I guess specific aroma is extracted at the certain part of the season only.",5
B09PRCVD17,"I TRULLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT... I JUST HAD ORAL SURGERY DUE TO A BAD ACCIDENT, AND MY THEETH WERE IN SO MUCH PAIN, IT WAS PAINFUL IN MY GUMS, WERE RED AND IFLAMED DUE TO THE BAD ACCIDENT I HAD. NOTHING WORKED, DOCTOR GAVE ME IBUPROPHEN, BUT IT ONLY COVERED THE PAIN... I USED THIS PRODUCT EVERY I ADDED DROPS AT FIRST INTO WATER, AND I RINSE AT NIGHT AND AM, AND PM, AFTER TWO DAYS I COULD FEEL THE DIFFERENCE, AND I WILL NEVER RINCE WITH ANYTHING EVER AGAIN!! I PUT IT ON EVERYTHING IT SMELLS FANTASTIC. THANK YOU!!",5
B09PRCVD17,I use this for my scalp it smells very nice like a minty ish smell great product.,4
B09PRCVD17,"I purchased this to discourage critters from entering our home. but now I want to try it in other diffusers when I want something invigorating (and on my hair as suggested on the label) - it's that pleasant. I wanted something 100% pure and this was, at least at the time of my purchase, seemingly great quality for the price. Would purchase again.",5
B09PRCVD17,I have tried purchasing cinnimon oils and they don't smell good and I have had to send them back. This product is really nice. I like my cinnimon to smell like cinnimon and this one does.  Great price for the size and packaged nicely so no damage and a dropper which I love. No waste. Highly reccomend.,5
B09PRCVD17,"I have used clove oil for years...I prefer to use natural remedies when I can.  I bought it today as a natural dental pain reliever.  Recent oral surgery in preparation for implants has left me with a multitude of stitches and frankly ""holes"".  Works practically on contact and lasts.  GREAT value for the size of the bottle and comes with a longer dropper for easy application.  The dropper is also made of glass, sanitary and easy to clean.",5
B09PRCVD17,Good value scent not very strong,4
B09PRCVD17,"I normally do not like the smell of sandalwood, but I needed an earthy scent for my natural hair products, and this particular sandalwood scent is perfect. It is not too strong but has a calming, soothing aroma.",5
B09PRCVD17,I am just so disappointed that they never offer the 4oz bottle any longer for the price I paid for it. Which was $9.99. Now they only have the 1oz bottles and are asking too much for them. When I purchased the 4oz bottle for $9.99 I should have bought a couple more at that time. I refuse to buy the small bottles for the price they are asking for it.,5
B09PRCVD17,I love this so much. Helps a bump I have and I highly recommend it.,5
B09PRCVD17,This peppermint oil is very fragrant and versatile. I use it daily for my homemade lotions and my humidifier for a lovely scent you can smell throughout the house.,5
B09PRCVD17,"I've gotten then flavors or smells from this brand that I didn't like as much as this. They did a good job with this vanilla. In fact the other lavender one I got that I had issues with became a good usable oil after adding some of this to it making vanilla, lavender smelling oil. I give this an A +.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Very potent, smells great and feels amazing on the skin. Use it both in my washer and my diffuser.",4
B09PRCVD17,"I use this oil in a mixture of other essential oils for overall health. It pairs nicely with the others and when I add this mixture to my coffee in the morning, it makes a delicious healthy cup.",5
B09PRCVD17,"It's not really a peppermint scent, more menthol like vicks vapor. I'm using it but honestly not impressed at all with it. This is the second brand that has claimed it's peppermint and it's really just menthol. There is an actual difference.",4
B09PRCVD17,If you have problems this work for Oral health,5
B09PRCVD17,"Needed Lime essential oil, ordered at a good price.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Unfortunately it was on the floor.  Slippery bottle, be careful.",4
B09PRCVD17,"First time buying this product. I owned up to its advertisement. Good Quality, Good Thickness, VERY GOOD POTENCY. Used diluted with a carrier oil on my skin, with a tooth mix for brushing, and drops as a mouth wash with water. I also use it in my coffee.  I am so pleased with this product.",5
B09PRCVD17,Great product.,4
B09PRCVD17,Wonderful and robust smelling. Perfect for candles and Oil Diffuser. Would buy again!,5
B09PRCVD17,"I love that it came with its own separate dropper to add into to as well as a regular lid, depending on your preference of use and how you plan to keep it. I use it every other wash on my hair, more so in the winter months for dry scalp/dandruff and I absolutely love it. The dropper helps me use the perfect amount, allowing me full control to not over oil my scalp. It can can go oily if too much is used. Best right after the shower.",5
B09PRCVD17,"The oil smells amazing, nice strong scent. love it.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Love the smell of cinnamon and I've been having a hard time just finding a cinnamon oil by itself with out and sweet smells attached, so when I found this I was thrilled. I just add a few drops into my already burning candles and it picks up the scent, and it adds such a warm comfortable smell to the house",5
B09PRCVD17,"This Helichrysum essential oil is powerful for healing scar tissue. I mix it with Tamanu oil to create a soothing massage blend that helps with older stretch marks and scar regeneration. The oil absorbs quickly into the skin and has a pleasant, natural scent. Perfect for DIY aromatherapy and massage oils.Pros:Effective for scar tissue and stretch marksAbsorbs quicklyNatural, pleasant scentCons:Pricey compared to other essential oils",5
B09PRCVD17,Will keep looking,4
B09PRCVD17,I love tea tree oil. I put about a teaspoon in my shampoo. It leaves a pleasant smell in my hair.,5
B09PRCVD17,I am addicted to sandalwood fragrance.  I use it as both perfume and hair gel.,5
B09PRCVD17,Smells great. Supplied with a syringe as well.,5
B09PRCVD17,The aroma is quite potent. Will definitely buy again,5
B09PRCVD17,Use this many ways,5
B09PRCVD17,"The couple of times I've had to use this, was for a tooth ache. It tastes terrible, as expected lol but it worked!! I would recommend this over orajel, Tylenol, or anything else you use for a toothache.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Great Product, i love it with an excellent soft scent.",5
B09PRCVD17,works and smells wonderful!,5
B09PRCVD17,Dropper arrived brokenUpdate: Seller immediately replaced bottle.,4
B09PRCVD17,It came as expected and I am putting it on my toe nail,5
B09PRCVD17,Use to eliminate unwanted odors in my house.,5
B09PRCVD17,Smooth silky absorbent,5
B09PRCVD17,Excelente producto bucal.,5
B09PRCVD17,Very nice,5
B09PRCVD17,Works great but the smell is a bit strong.,4
B09PRCVD17,Not a permanent fix but does relieve toothache temporarily.,4
B09PRCVD17,As described,4
B09PRCVD17,Obviously anything of this type takes awhile to get any results.  So nothing to report.,4
B09PRCVD17,Needed an essential oil for my humidifier & breathing machine. Very mild & soothing. Helps me relax at bedtime. Also makes my rooms smell awesome,5
B09PRCVD17,I used this oil to Douce the affected area and it relieved the pain and misery I was experiencing.,5
B09PRCVD17,"I received this product yesterday. Before I even took the plastic off the box, I could smell the wonderful peppermint. It is very strong which is what I was looking for. It smells amazing! The glass dropper that is included was intact. Another manufacturer I had tried the vial was broken when I received it. I am very very happy with this purchase and will purchase it again in the near future. If you are looking for a strong, clean, fresh peppermint, this is it!",5
B09PRCVD17,Good quality I still have a brand I prefer a little more but this one is far more worth the money inexpensive and very high quality for the price already recommended to friends,5
B09PRCVD17,i cancelled this also as i use biotene on my hair,5
B09PRCVD17,Great oil.  I bought it for my hair to use twice a week on my scalp.  I love it.,5
B09PRCVD17,Great size for the price,4
B09PRCVD17,The best product out there for ylang ylang! Smells exactly like the real one. Can't wait to order more and more!,5
B09PRCVD17,"Bought for use in a spray bottle, to deter mice in a utility trailer.  Does the job!",5
B09PRCVD17,Has a nice smell.,4
B09PRCVD17,I love the convenient dropper. I can easily make everything smell like cinnamon! !,4
B09PRCVD17,Smells wonderful last a long time I use it on my current melt aways when they lose their scent works perfectly also combined with oils and it's a wonderful perfume would highly recommend,5
B09PRCVD17,At first smell is strong.  It does disappear shortly.  It does not leave my hair greasy which is a plus.  Waiting to see if any new hair grows,5
B09PRCVD17,I'm a nurse and I put this on a mask prior to changing people and it helps mask the smell,5
B09PRCVD17,I used this as an ingredient in an insect repellent.,5
B09PRCVD17,"I was excited to see that you could get a 4oz bottle. I have always bought at local stores and you can only get 1oz. I use it a lot so I was glad for 4oz. I use it in spray bottles to spray all baseboards and window sills. I also use it in the washing machine. I would put it in the shampoo bottle but hubby said no to that one, lol. This is a great product and I would suggest you buy it if you use it like I do.",5
B09PRCVD17,Great!,5
B09PRCVD17,"I used it in both diffuser and laundry washing.  When my load was done, I could smell the sweet vanilla.  For my diffuser, which is in the bathroom, I couldn't smell the vanilla.",5
B09PRCVD17,"Es muy suave con la piel, no irrita",5
B000PCY91O,Got these to go with the glue gun I ordered. The glue is crystal clear as advertised and works very well in my new gun. I do recommend this glue for anyone looking for a clear glue. This is also a great value.,5
B000PCY91O,These things work great and hold strong. We've never have an issue.,5
B000PCY91O,"This glue stick works in my Gorilla Glue Gun as advertised. I am deducting one star because the diameter of this glue stick appears to be slightly smaller than the OEM ones from Gorila so there is less glue, but it still works and as you pull the trigger, the Glue Gun still pulls the glue stick through so it is not a large problem, but you are getting slightly less glue than the OEM glue sticks.",4
B000PCY91O,Good price work well,5
B000PCY91O,"They were prefect! Easy to use and heat right up.  Seems durable and performing really well on all I used it for including a tea light holder.  Very versatile from shoes, to candles,  to crafts,  to repairs.  Love the pack for the price!",5
B000PCY91O,good,5
B000PCY91O,happy with purchase,5
B000PCY91O,"I wish I had some of this years ago. It holds as well as other glues, but looks so much better.",5
B000PCY91O,Bought the wrong glue stick. Didn't realize there was a full size and a mini.,4
B000PCY91O,GOOD PRODUCT,5
B000PCY91O,Gracias,5
B000PCY91O,I wish they were longerThey do get the job done you just have to keep pushing then in more frequently than the longer type.,4
B000PCY91O,Not long enough,5
B000PCY91O,Many in the pack for the coast,5
B000PCY91O,"It is my favorite thing to do crafts with my daughter, and we needed a glue gun to do so. We bought one from a craft store. It was fantastic, but we ran out of hot glue gun sticks, so my daughter begged me for the past week for hot glue gun sticks, so I searched on Amazon for hot glue gun sticks and i saw this one and bought it.They worked well. They melted really well and they got here quick. but the only thing is they are really small, in the advertisement they say its 7 in or something along lines of that but they are more like 3-4 in longbut over all they worked well",4
B000PCY91O,Ok,5
B000PCY91O,They melt perfect for all of our projects.,5
B000PCY91O,I use these glue Stix a lot for repairs and it is great.,5
B000PCY91O,I saw a lot of reviews that said it was the wrong size but if you pay attention it is for the large FULL SIZE HOT GLUE gun and not the smaller warm glue guns. Worked perfectly for my gun and needs.,5
B000PCY91O,Works as intended,5
B000PCY91O,Ran out of glue sticks ordered. These bees were good. Price was good. Nothing fancy to say but great product overall.,5
B000PCY91O,"Perfect for high tem guns, very little excess dripping, no smell, holds very durable, heats up with normal heating times.I mean perfect.  Quality is great and so many for the money!",5
B000PCY91O,"I have reg glue sticks already,  really needed truly transparent,  these are not as stated. Still a light milky finish glue. Disappointed. Had I known Id have not used, returned. But will use elsewhere.",3
B000PCY91O,For my glue gun I love my glue gun works really good what I do is I can build furniture or build shelves with my glue gun it'll instantly hold together and then I pre-drill it afterwards and drill screws in,5
B000PCY91O,"Full size glue sticks - not for a mini glue gun. Easy to use, melt well, adhere well, cools clear.",5
B000PCY91O,"Bought because the glue is supposed to stay very clear. Did not work as expected. Turns a light milky white. Did not work for my craft project. However, as a glue it is great.",4
B000PCY91O,"did what i wanted Thanks, great price",5
B000PCY91O,"Good quality hot glue. I purchased this a couple times and used it to  glue 1"" insulation boards to MDF. I also made a sound suppressor  box for my workshop vacuum unit. I used it to glue sound deadening foam river inside the box. I would recommend.",5
B000PCY91O,what can you say about glue,5
B000PCY91O,Good,5
B000PCY91O,Works as expected. Zero issues.,5
B000PCY91O,Great quality glue sticks allow me to create everything for our Halloween costumes this year and they were durable !,5
B000PCY91O,"I tried to save money by getting these over the gorilla glue ones and it was a bust. I do not like these. They're not created equal. I can't say I recommend for just anyone. If it's craft time with kids, sure, this is a great option.",3
B000PCY91O,Good product,5
B000PCY91O,Will probably stick with Gorilla though.,3
B000PCY91O,Thank you is a good product.,5
B000PCY91O,Great price!,5
B000PCY91O,Received as described,5
B000PCY91O,Used for my crafts,5
B000PCY91O,Very thick glue sticks and work great with craft projects,5
B000PCY91O,Not size I needed.,3
B000PCY91O,These work really good in my hot glue gun and will buy again when I run out.,5
B000PCY91O,I use it for craft and shop projects. Works great.,5
B000PCY91O,"work well, no problems",5
B000PCY91O,Works as it should.  So far no issues with the glue sticks.,4
B000PCY91O,No duran mucho se despega bastante el glue a la hora de secarse,3
B000PCY91O,"Since these are bigger, you have to be careful about not getting it on your fingers! Leaves major blisters!",5
B000PCY91O,Works Fine,5
B000PCY91O,"I could see with my own eyes that they weren't crystal clear before I purchased them.  So, why are people complaining about them not being crystal clear.  It's called marketing hype, and the FTC could care less about this kind of advertising scheme.  You're not going to find a glue stick that's as clear as water; it's not going to happen.  Having said that, they're on par with any other glue stick out there, and they do the job that they're supposed to do.",5
B000PCY91O,Worked as expected,5
B000PCY91O,Works as expected. Cordless is a plus.,5
B000PCY91O,"Works well, happy with the glue sticks, quantity and price!",5
B000PCY91O,Great price for a large selection of glue sticks.  Quality product without unnecessary overwrapping of product.,5
B000PCY91O,Love these glue sticks!! Highly recommend! Great quality & great price!! A++++,5
B000PCY91O,Like,5
B000PCY91O,These glue sticks are very useful for a variety of different things.,5
B000PCY91O,"Doesn't hold as well as other brands. I think cuz is a clear dry, it's too smooth to really grip the items. Light materials are ok to use with this, but not heavier projects",4
B000PCY91O,Product as described,5
B000PCY91O,The glue sticks work in the new glue gun as do all others.  Next time I may be looking for ones that are longer.  It can be a pain to continue to put a stick in the gun if you have a big project.,4
B000PCY91O,Excellent glue sticks that fit perfectly into my hot glue gun and the quality is great for the job.,5
B000PCY91O,These glue sticks perform well on a variety of materials. Especially good adhesion on porous materials. They fit a standard size glue gun. Hot glue from these sticks dries fairly clear.,5
B000PCY91O,I like it,5
B000PCY91O,I bought these and they were the wrong size for my glue gun so I was going to return them and they not only gave me my money back but told me to keep them! Very good customer service! Definitely recommend!,5
B000PCY91O,Real sweet deal if you are into crafts because this is some good high quality glue sticks.,5
B000PCY91O,Good price,5
B000PCY91O,"AdTech Hot Glue Sticks in the 4"" full-size variant are a must-have for any DIY enthusiast or crafter. Here's what I love about them:The clear sticks are incredibly versatile and suitable for a wide range of projects. They bond quickly and securely, making them ideal for both minor repairs and intricate crafts.The 4"" size provides enough glue for extended use, and the pack of 50 sticks ensures you won't run out anytime soon.I appreciate that they are clear, leaving no visible residue or marks, which is essential for projects where aesthetics matter.In conclusion, AdTech Hot Glue Sticks are reliable, versatile, and offer excellent value for the price. Whether you're working on home projects or creative crafts, these sticks won't disappoint. Highly recommended!",5

B000PCY91O,"Excellent quality, fits my glue gun,great performance and heats up nicely. Very durable and nice clarity.",5
B000PCY91O,Work great for crafting. flow evenly and adhere well to most surfaces.,5
B000PCY91O,"My son needed these to complete his project he's been working on. The purchase was a success for fulfilling his need & I was impressed with its holding strength for the mask he was making.  The  quantity of sticks was also worth the purchase, due to having them on hand for other projects. Will be a returning customer when the time comes & will definitely recommend",5
B000PCY91O,Holds well and keeps things together.  May even work on Marriages,5
B000PCY91O,Good,5
B000PCY91O,"Personally I think this glue is Awesome.  It seems to hold very well.  It's not expensive for the quality.

B000PCY91O,"Great value, quick delivery and they really do dry clear impressive",5
B000PCY91O,These glue sticks work well with the glue gun I have,5
B000PCY91O,Exelente calidad .,5
B000PCY91O,What more do you need to know.. glues sticks that fit a standard glue gun.,5
B000PCY91O,These fit my Gorilla Glue Gun perfectly. They are good quality and dies clear.,5
B000PCY91O,short requiring re-loads but works fine,5
B000PCY91O,I love these so much and they are the only thing that work for my classroom walls. One bag and you're good for years which saves a ton of money in the long run. I also share these with my coworkers often and I have more than enough! I love this big bag and I'm so glad I bought them.,5
B000PCY91O,great item,5
B000PCY91O,Was economical.,5
B000PCY91O,"Received the bag of glue sticks in a small box with other items I ordered. The bag of glue sticks was ripped open at the bottom - I counted the glue sticks and there were 48 there, so the bag and box were missing two glue sticks.",4
B08VHGLBPT,"I bought this in order to spice up my photocards and it works amazingly! It's easy to use and is great for the price. I recommend using the item upside down to get the cleanest cut. Other than that, highly recommend!",5
B08VHGLBPT,"This is a neat little gadget for softening corners on paper.  At first, I was not pleased as it was hit and miss with the uniformity of the cutting and was about to return it.  I turned it over and punched from the back since you can see exactly where the corner is.  AWESOME..just make sure to clean the punch out after using.  Gave 4 stars as I feel details should be provided to use gadget properly.",4
B08VHGLBPT,"There are many of these corner rounders available but I'm happy with this one.  I had some trouble with getting a good cut a few times but realized I wasn't inserting the corner of the paper snug against both edges before punching and got odd nicks instead of smooth corners.  Practice a little, take your time and you'll like this one.",5
B08VHGLBPT,My biggest complaint is the corners it cuts are not round. They are round-ISH. The button is hard to press. And only the largest corner even pretends to be round. There has to be a better one but I've not found it YET.,3
B08VHGLBPT,"This handy 3-in-1 corner rounder is a must-have for any crafter! It makes quick work of rounding corners on photos, cards, and paper projects. The different sized punches (4mm, 7mm, and 10mm) offer versatility, and the sturdy build ensures clean cuts. This tool is a real time-saver and adds a professional touch to any project.",5
B08VHGLBPT,I use this frequently and like that there's a variety of corners to choose from. It's comfortable to hold and the punches are accurate each time. Great quality!,5
B08VHGLBPT,On time and as promised.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"The kids really liked all of the different corner options on this device. Sometimes it took two or more clicks of the button to get it to cut properly. Perhaps they just need to be sharper? Otherwise the device was very sturdy and of good quality. It was very easy to use with the exception of sometimes needing to press the button multiple times or retry by taking it off the corner and putting it back on the corner. Would buy again, but would love to see some improvement on the performance. Liked the small design and the different size options. Good value for the money.",4
B08VHGLBPT,The puncher is large and easy to use.  I would buy more.,5
B08VHGLBPT,Prompt delivery.  This was a gift and was well liked.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"This punch is only for corners (you cannot use the hole punch in the top center of the page like for a bookmark.You can miss the slot and end up with a weird corner that is hard to fix.Otherwise it works well. I used it for 12 pt cardstock. If you want to use it on regular paper, you'll need to do multiple sheets at once.",4
B08VHGLBPT,"it is kinda okay -- sometimes when I go to punch the corner it seems to not catch the paper correctly and does not make a clean cut ... if I ever need to buy another, would probably get a diff brand",4
B08VHGLBPT,Hermoso,5
B08VHGLBPT,Super easy to use and great punch quality! Doesn't stick and is light weight! The design is to round the edges of your paper!,5
B08VHGLBPT,"I'm using it for holiday cards and it's working well, it's not exactly perfect, but enough to where I'm not sure anyone will notice. It does NOT work well on thin standard paper.",4
B08VHGLBPT,I love the corner choices and ease of use.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"This works well but if you don't align the paper edge perfectly you can get a wonky cut. In order to see if your corner is well aligned you have to flip it over, and then back again if you want the wasted paper to not fly in your face.",4
B08VHGLBPT,Works fine,5
B08VHGLBPT,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I really like the efficiency of the product it's just that it doesn't alway cut as sharp as I'd want or expect it to and it started happening in late September and I bought it early August. Aside from that it's a really useful product to have I use it to cut laminated paper as the edges are usually too sharp so I use it to smooth around the edges.Would still recommend it.,4

B08VHGLBPT,It does the job well and is reasonably easy to use.  Neither exceptional nor disappointing.,4
B08VHGLBPT,I like this paper punch because it has three different corner shapes.  It works easily & shipment was a week quicker than first stated.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"I am NOT a crafter, however, I'm a homeschooling math that prints alot of things out for my kids.  The corner punch really elevates the visual aid I use with the kids.",5
B08VHGLBPT,Easy to use for anyone with arthritis.  Makes nice clean cuts for cornersI'm,5
B08VHGLBPT,I junk journal and this was a great addition to my supplies. I can add a cute cut border to the papers I lay and it's really easy to use and store.,5
B08VHGLBPT,Works as advertised.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"It seemed to work great at first, but after punching a little over 100 corners of laminated cardstock the blades are dull and no longer able to reliably cut the laminate.",3
B08VHGLBPT,amazing for scrapvook,4
B08VHGLBPT,Great item! This tiny puncher does its job very well! Very useful and makes my greeting cards looks very professional! This is very worth it and every crafter should have!,5
B08VHGLBPT,One of the corner round cuts is so tiny that I probably will not use that one.  Other ones are OK.,4
B08VHGLBPT,This is a great tool for crafting.,5
B08VHGLBPT,Good quality product,5
B08VHGLBPT,The blades are sharp enough to get a smooth cut when rounding the corners of cardstock. Easy to use and 3 choices on corner size.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"This is a great little corner-shaper for paper! However, I thought this listing was for 1 product in several color options, and that is not the case--each one has different specifications. So, the pink puncher I purchased is not really a corner rounder--it makes 3 different shapes (see picture) but not a simple rounded corner. Still cute and useful for crafts! I will have to buy the actual (white!) corner rounder separately.",4
B08VHGLBPT,"Very sharp, trims paper well. Durability is good.",4
B08VHGLBPT,"Works great, make sure to flip when using so you can see the corner edge allign.",5
B08VHGLBPT,"This works great, but it does get stuck from time to time. Just have to make sure you clear it out, it is a quick fix.",4
B08VHGLBPT,Light weight cuts perfect smooth cuts through a thick cardstock with no problems,5
B08VHGLBPT,"I bought this to put rounded corners on some things I had laminated for my classroom. It cut through cardstock laminated in 5ml sleeves. I only have two complaints. One - the button you press is small so after doing 4 or 5 it started to hurt my thumb. Two - There is no catch for the parts it cuts off. They fly everywhere. However, it does put a nice corner on my cards which will hopefully stop the kiddos from poking themselves on them.",4
B08VHGLBPT,Works fine. Downside is it doesn't have a tray to catch the clippings. I don't know if any do.,4
B08VHGLBPT,I love this corner punch! It is durable and creates precise corners. You just need to be sure to align your paper correctly. My previous corner punch broke so I needed a replacement because rounded corners just add a nice finishing touch to projects. I also like that this has multiple sizes.,5
B08VHGLBPT,Was exactly as advertised and on time. Product was sturdier than expected.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"For the value, it works perfectly.  One sheet at a time.  Not a problem.  This is not an industrial production type of device.  I am surprised by the negative reviews.  It is a small simple product that does the job.  If you want something for multiple sheets, buy something else at the $400.00 price range.",5
B08VHGLBPT,I ordered it for journaling and making stickers. Works perfectly. I was expecting it to be small but was perfect size for my small hands.,4
B08VHGLBPT,This is a great little snippet for rounded corners! I have a 6 mil film that needs rounded corners and this little tool does the trick. So easy to get rounded polished edges. Love it.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"Thank goodness for YouTube videos - saw this being used, and it's much easier than any of my other corner rounders. Also cuts through more than 1 layer.",5
B08VHGLBPT,I really like these corner punches. This is my second one.  Easy to use and nice quality,5
B08VHGLBPT,"A little sticky and took some finagling to use at times, but overall a great cheap option to round corners on our wedding invitations",4
B08VHGLBPT,Great corner stamp for photo albums or working on pictures or other products,5
B08VHGLBPT,"This corner puncher is rather temperamental when used right side up.  However, turning upside down allows you to line up the corner of your project correctly in the cutting die, then press the cutting mechanism.  Works quite well upside down.",4
B08VHGLBPT,"Used for our save the dates. I was hesitant with how inexpensive it is, but it worked great on the quality cardstock. Created even and smooth results, and no fringes. Was able to work through hundreds of cards within a short period of time. Actually quite fun to do!",5
B08VHGLBPT,I love this corner punch.  It was exactly what I was looking for!!  Thank you amazon as you were the only place I could find one of these!!,5
B08VHGLBPT,"Very nice varied size corner round.  Bought due to the recommendation of a friend.  Didn't disappoint.  Like having 3 sizes on 1 punch, it punches nicely, unless you have popper that is very heavy.  Easy to use.",4
B08VHGLBPT,Two of the three areas work but one doesn't cut at all no matter how I adjust the paper.,3
B08VHGLBPT,These were great for rounding off edges on my stickers for my small business! Great value and lightweight. Easy to use and the different sizes come in handy for customization.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"I really like this tool. I hate wrinkled or bent corners on paper, so let's just get rid of the root cause altogether!!!",5
B08VHGLBPT,Excited to use this little tool to help my son make labels without having shape corners. We tried it out and it works great.,5
B08VHGLBPT,This is perfect for rounding edges when crafting or making cards and planner pages.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"Love this corner rounder, but the smallest corner became unusable due to getting dull or stuck and just shreds the corners now.",4
B08VHGLBPT,I Like the way the pages look in my journal and I can give photos without frames a new look.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"Overall I'm still glad I made this purchase. But it could be better. You have to be REALLY careful how you place something in this punch before you punch it, otherwise it will somehow leave a jagged or ragged edge rather than a curved corner, almost looking like an animal took a bite out of our, thereby irreveribly messing up your craft project. I've gotten better about being suuuuuper gingerly and careful with how I place the cardstock or paper into it, but it still messes up around 5-10% of the time... which doesn't sound like a lot, but it is a lot if you're punching all 4 corners or a product that you're trying to sell.",3
B08VHGLBPT,Its a good product. It easily cuts the edges and looks nice. Its small enough to travel with. My only issue is that it doesn't have a bottom to collect the scrap paper.,4
B08VHGLBPT,It was a have to have item for my round corners on my booklets...loving it.,4
B08VHGLBPT,"Great punch. Cuts 110# bond cardstock easily. Could not cut more than one sheet of #110 at a time.Two elements used to align the corner for a smooth full radius cut (doesn't leave mis-aligned sharp break at tangent of the curve like some cutters do). Compared this with a few others, this was far superior. Smooth even radius, and smooth even cut.Wish it had a catch tray for the cutoffs - only complaint. Use this flat on a table for easy of control and alignment of paper.Punched 160 cards (640 total punches) on cardstock and the sharpness held up, perhaps dulled slightly.  FOr the price and that heavy of use, it's worth buying a second.",5
B08VHGLBPT,Excellent for scrapbooking.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"Loved that this has multiple punch shapes/sized. Bought to add a soft rounded corner to the Save The Dates for my wedding, can't wait to use for other projects.Used for over 100 thick postcards so far and showed zero dulling",5
B08VHGLBPT,"Only worked a couple times and then all three options started chewing the corners. Finally figured out paper is getting caught somewhere inside, so you have to bang in its side and clean it out every time you use it... Even though it doesn't have a scrap catcher and leaves messes already. Hopefully it will keep working.",3
B08VHGLBPT,No complaints. It does what I need it to do.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"Somehow the bottom was not on it, or it was stuck in the wrap and I may have discarded it. I had to cut a makeshift bottom for it to catch the debris. It does not consistently fit the same size cards one after another (separately) to cut. I end up with short clipped corners on some and have to reinsert. This is a machined part, maybe it isn't properly aligned. Won't buy again.",2
B08VHGLBPT,"When this corner punch works it makes a nice corner.  However it often takes a notch out of the corner of the photo instead of a curve.  Maybe I just got a bad one as most of the reviews were good.  Also, it does not catch the clippings and they are on the table/floor which you must be mindful of when using it.",3
B08VHGLBPT,It is what I needed to finish some corners on a card set,5
B08VHGLBPT,Started out great. But then it stopped cutting all the way through the paper and I would have to go back and use scissors to correct. Or have to pull (and risk the page tearing),3
B08VHGLBPT,"I bought this for some special alphabet flashcards I had painted for a great niece and nephew.  My paintings were put on a thumb drive and then printed on photo paper which I then decided to laminate.  I wanted to cut the corners thouugh, knowing that laminate corners can be quite sharp.  This just did not do the job.  It would sometimes cut through the paper, but not the laminate, but most often I would have to try several times.  I finally gave in and just rounded the corners with scissors.  A great disappointment.",2
B08VHGLBPT,I simply love the corner rounder. So easy to use. Nice to use when you have thumbs that hurt all the time.,5
B08VHGLBPT,"I had one in the 90s and have been looking ever since.  It's great for my lable making, and putting pics & other items in the books I write , gives them flair.  I use it on my business cards too.  This way I don't have to go through so many cricut needles",5
B00178QSE6,"Worked great for building a book nook (cutebee magic pharmacist). It worked well because it takes several minutes to bond completely, so you are able to make corrections. However, this means you have to hold or stabilize your structure or whatever you are glueing for several minutes while it sets.",5
B00178QSE6,I used this on fabric & wood works a little to good lol. I tried to pry some off to move the pieces making them look a bit more like they belong. Never was able to remove them once glue fully dried lol. Was shocked how well it worked when attaching wood to fabric.  (First DIY project in ages.),5
B00178QSE6,"I wouldn't use it to repair holes, as the bond tears away readily under sufficient tension, but for things advertised, such as hem adjustment, or patches, it seems very good.",4
B00178QSE6,I bought it to make two 100 day of school shirts. The glue takes a while to dry but it kept the flowers on the shirt. My daughter only lost 2 flowers during a busy day in Kindergarten. I still have a ton of glue left even though I put 200 flowers on the shirts. There is barely any smell and I was okay paying the price for the amount glue you get. Can only recommend,5
B00178QSE6,"This is probably the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon.It simply does not work. Takes FOREVER to try, and when it does, the bond it NOT strong. And that is not even the worst part - it STAINED the fabric.I had run out of my ""TV"" glue - and decided to try a cheaper alternative. I had heard of the Aleen brand, so thought it might by good. I didn't need it at the time I purchased the glue, but rather wanted it 'in reserve' for when I needed it. I wish I had tried it while it was still in the return time window - because I definitely would have returned it to Amazon.Save your money and the frustration of this product;s failure to perform and put the money you would waste on this Aleen glue toward the good stuff.",1
B00178QSE6,"Although this is the my first experience with fabric glue, I am still disappointed. I used this glue to adhere satin fabric inside a hoodie of mine with the intent to sew it as a permanent solution but the glue dried hard, didn't fully fuse the two fabrics and discolored the satin fabric. I'm glad I tried this product with an old hoodie and satin fabric because I will not be using it again.",3
B00178QSE6,WORKS GREAT,5
B00178QSE6,Just what I needed. People are charging ridiculous prices just to hem pants,5
B00178QSE6,I used this glue to reattach some decorative beads of my sweater.  Easy to use.,5
B00178QSE6,He managed to burn a hole in his portable ice fishing house so he used this glue to cover the hole and so far it is holding.,5
B00178QSE6,Very useful.,4
B00178QSE6,Great company,5
B00178QSE6,Works well for the intended purpose. I am happy with the final results. Highly recommend this as an affordable fixing option.,5
B00178QSE6,Great adhesive for canvas material.,5
B00178QSE6,Needed to patch up some old furniture and this fabric adhesive held up and created a strong hold.,5
B00178QSE6,Did not work for what I needed it for. I wanted it to put these patches on a nylon bag & it seemed to do a good job at first but then the patches started peeling. I tried to do it again & leave everything to dry longer with something heavy on top & still it is not holding. Very disappointed. Wasted my money,3
B00178QSE6,It works,4
B00178QSE6,Easy to apply works great,5
B00178QSE6,It says permanent on the bottle but gentle washing and drying instruction makes it seem that it is not..js,4
B00178QSE6,"I order this glue for a decorative throw pillow which had a small rip in the pillow's seem. I applied this fabric glue to my throw pillow and used a plastic food bag snap ""the kind for chips and snacks"" to hold it together. It dried overnight and has held up perfectly. The glue is clear, and it dries perfectly clear, so there is no white glue showing with this product. The overall strength of the glue is outstanding! I love this product, and I am so happy that I purchased it. I even used it on a pair of dress slacks to hem it up some, and it has held up even after washing.  Another added bonus is that you get 4 ounces, so there's quite a lot of glue in the bottle. So I do highly recommend this product to others, and I give it a perfect 5 stars! ""Photo of the glue with the throw pillow.""",5
B00178QSE6,"Works great for medium and light duty jobs.  No bad odor and good value. Adhesive holds as expected.  I've used it on a bed comforter that wore out and ripped.  The material is too worn to sew, so this was a great alternative that has held up nice.  I also used it to hold the edge seem of a fabric chair.  This was a lot to ask for just glue, but I think it is holding up pretty well, considering.",5
B00178QSE6,"I ordered the Aleene's 23473 Fabric Fusion Permanent Fabric Adhesive. I like it and it works, except it's not that strong for my purse situation which is a heavy, thick canvas with large iron on patches. A lot of the edges of the patches were starting to curl up, and I was hoping this would fix the problem versus putting a few stitches in and it worked a little bit, but most of the edges just flipped up and I have to constantly glue them again. My purse is black, and it does not dry, clear and sort of leaves a whitish residue. It may be unrealistic to think this would work since the back of those patches has a different texture than another piece of fabric, but I'm just sharing my experience.",4
B00178QSE6,Used it to apply grosgrain ribbon yards of grosgrain ribbon to dress I made for my granddaughter. Tried completely clear.,5
B00178QSE6,"A stain on the side of a suitcase was unsightly. So, my collection of African fabrics and this glue made it easy to cover the stains with fabric cut into heart shapes. The glue held nicely and made the project fun.",5
B00178QSE6,Works great,5
B00178QSE6,Works great to hem my pants.,4
B00178QSE6,I used this stuff to add patches to jeans in the crotch area. Works really well!,5
B00178QSE6,took longer to adhere than I expected,4
B00178QSE6,These was super easy !! .. it does take a while for it to dry the only thing I didn't like was that on the back side of the clothes you can see the stain it leaves. No one can see it but you because it's pn the inside of your clothes  so I guess it's okay...,4
B00178QSE6,WorksAs described,4
B00178QSE6,"Tried this glue on an all weather motorcycle cover. Some of the seams were coming loose, thought this might work. Did not work. Didn't seem to soak in and dry completely even after 3 days.I think it would be fine on normal fabrics, just not the waterproof material my cover is made with.",4
B00178QSE6,"I had a few jeans I had to repair and used hankies to use as patches, so far this glue has held up they are not very big holes so I will update my reivew when I have a bigger patch on",5
B00178QSE6,"I bought this from Amazon in 2011 for a project apparently I never ended up doing because the bottle was unopened and still wrapped in plastic sitting in my sewing basket where I found it a few days ago as I was about to stitch on a whole bunch of appliques I'd just bought from Amazon to a bedspread (down inside some kind of polyester I think on the outside).  This is a bedpread I love but for reasons to embarrassing to explain here I had made two large holes in.  I bought a bunch of appliques from Amazon, including some crocheted ones from pepperlonely brand (that somehow pleased my eye the best when I laid them all out on the poor damaged bedspread and was about to stitch  a bunch on -- altho just 2 holes the only way the bedspread would look ""right"" is if I positioned (not centered!!) the appliques in a way the seemed to match the flow of the embroidered flowers that are NOT all over the bedspread but in certain places.  Anyway, daunted by the prospect of stitching all the appliques on to try and save my bedspread.  I decided to try this unopened bottle instead.I used a plastic knife to spread the glue on, pushed down for maybe 30 seconds or so (all the while the bedspread was on my bed so I could make sure the appliques were placed where I wanted them to go -- and voila, it worked.  True, I haven't washed it.  I had washed the bedspread (something I don't do very often, no need as it isn't on my bed most days) right before applying the appliques (no fabric softener) as the instructions say, so I'm not about to wash it now.  But the appliques maybe 15 in all (used clusters of 3 in some places) seem on tight as can be.  (I did this yesterday.) And I don't have seepage all around.  Even the appliques over the two holes where they are binding in part to the down underneath are tight.It worked (I'll amend if there's a problem after I wash it).  And it was easy.  And it took no time.  I'm sold even if one or two did come off after washing I'd be more than willing to use this product to put them back on again.",5
B00178QSE6,"The product does work too bring fabric back together. BUT, the product leaves a hard line where the fabric is now bonded. If the repair happens to be in an area where you sit or lie, you will feel the repair. Also, it is not too flexible which can be felt. Still, it is a clear product and repairs don't show too much.",4
B00178QSE6,Good stuff. Glues more than just fabric,5
B00178QSE6,"I see its overall rating here and elsewhere is 4 out of 5 which astounds me because I've used this hundreds (well over two hundred) of times and I can't remember when it didn't work. As far as adhesives go, fabric adhesives in general are off the chart great, and this is the best I've used.  I remember when I bought my first bottle, the choice was put as between a less good formula (same brand) that dried quickly and this one that dried a little slower but was superior. This formula doesn't take even that long to dry - I believe it holds up in the wash after only 24 hours. Reasons to only give it an A+ rather than an A++ is - after you've had it awhile, you need to keep the bottle upside down because otherwise if takes forever for it to flow out and squeezing doesn't help - and, you can use too much and create a stiff or visible spot.",5
B00178QSE6,"No stinky odor, quick and easy to use, great results! You can dispense a tiny line of Aileen's on your item, or you can unscrew the lid and apply it with a toothpick. I used this to mend the binding on a velour sofa cover. I clamped it with a binder clip to keep both sides of the binding in place while it dried. It came out beautiful! No glue seeped out, the repair is undetectable, and I was surprised at how the repaired area is just as flexible as the rest of the sofa cover. I recommend Aileen's for those who love ease of use and a repair that restores an item to be like new.",5
B00178QSE6,Have used on a few garmets. Works well.,4
B00178QSE6,"I poured it on from the base opening not the pointed tip because I didn't want to chance clogging the tip.  It is easy to spread after putting glop down.  I used pieces of cardboard torn from an Enterman's box.  I would have given it a Five Star Rating but found I had to give it a second and maybe a third quick dose somewhere around the edges.  It's a compromise between putting extra on to make sure all the edges are completely satisfied, which also results in over kill which hardens, and not putting extra and finding some edge was not satisfied.  Because I am using 'old' jeans to cut patch material from, I have found that the patch material gives out before this products attachment does...",4
B00178QSE6,The glue took a while to dry but it did work,4
B00178QSE6,Works good,4
B00178QSE6,"NEED TO SHORTEN PILLOW CASES BECAUSE SOMEONE ORDERED THE WRONG SIZE FOR ME.  WELL, IT TOOK SOME PRACTICE BUT IT WORKED OUT FANTASTIC..  GOOD STRONG GLUE..",5
B00178QSE6,I used it on a couch at my rental property. It didn't work. I ended up having to sew it up. I left the item with glue for two days and i was able to easily pull the glued pieces apart.,2
B00178QSE6,"Have used this to glue patches onto my boys' trousers, at the knee of course, and it's FAR superior to buying special iron-on patches, and MUCH easier and faster than sewing.  Turn the pants inside out.  Sacrifice an old (small) pants to cut into patches.  Make the patch a mere inch or so larger than the rip.  It helps to put paper or an index card under the place you'll glue, to keep the glue from spreading deep into the next layer of fabric, but that's not such an issue; the glue has a good thickness and isn't too runny.  Press the patch on top.  Then press it all under a couple of books, and a few minutes later it's done.  Unless you're very messy or use way too much glue, it ends up clean, no stains, glue stays in place.  Pants I glued a couple of months ago, subject to extreme use, show no signs of weakening (unlike iron on patches, which haven't lasted for me.)Has also worked very well for making things like placemats, tablecloth from extra fabric -- but impt to keep lines very straght.  Awkward to use to darn socks, so for that I still use needle and thread.In short, an excellent product with just the right amount of thickness, glue-ability, and it seems to last.  Note, I used the fabric fusion permanent adhesive, not the instant dry type.  4 oz bottle, after many uses I'm down to about 3-3/4 oz, so it's a good amount.  Each time I am done I squeeze out all excess air, then cap it, then store it on its side so air doesn't get in... Perhaps that's overkill but no problem so far with bottle drying out, should last me years.",5
B00178QSE6,"Bought this to help adhere a patch to a baseball jersey that was coming off. At first, it seemed to be working but after drying overnight, the patch just started peeling off again. Tried it on another shirt and it didn't hold the fabric down either - should have bought something a bit stronger. This would work for very light items but not thicker fabric.",3
B00178QSE6,It works great,3
B00178QSE6,"I had never used a product like this before, so wasn't really sure it would work. I made a pillow for my couch, and covered it with a fairly thick material.  I couldn't manage to sew it, so I tried this.  I smeared the glue on both pieces, clamped them together, and let it dry.  So far, it's holding fine, and looks great.",5
B00178QSE6,I was disappointed that it stained a sweater of mine,3
B00178QSE6,"This is some very good glue, it holds my fabric together really good.  I can use this on all sorts of materials, it's easy to use and holds my materials together almost permanently and doesn't have a smell .this is very durable glue fir the price.",5
B00178QSE6,"Worked great for synthetic fabric. Don't use the tube to get glue out, use some kind of spreader like a qtip or a small piece of wood. Unscrew the top to use",4
B00178QSE6,"I purchased this fabric glue 5/2021 and used it for a project with white yarn (in 6/2021 for reference) after weaving in the ends and gluing them so they would be more secure. I originally rated it 5 stars because it worked great. However, I am now adjusting my rating (from 5 stars to 3) and writing this review. This glue does not dry clear in the long term; in the attached picture you see four different areas where I used the glue, and all four are discolored. It turned a pinkish hue over time. The color difference is more noticable in person, but tried to get a picture in natural light that captured it best. While the ends are still securely in place from the glue, I cannot use this on project with white yarn (or even light colored yarn as it also discolored the light blue yarn in the picture). It may still be ok for darker colored fabric, but I will be looking for an alternative when it comes to using on white or light colored yarn or fabric.",3
B00178QSE6,Great for a permanent hold for fabric.,5
B00178QSE6,"I've used this product to patch blue jeans and small holes in fabric, since I don't' sew.  It's very strong and holds up very well as far as  I've experienced.  I would recommend it.",5
B00178QSE6,"When you mend the tare, after fully dry that area mended is very stiff.  Not very flexible.",4
B00178QSE6,"I used this to repair my favorite jean jacket and glue a patch into it. It was easy to use and clean up, and adhered to the fabric and denim very well. Make sure to let this fully dry before moving your piece or it will slip and need to be redone.",5
B00178QSE6,"I love all of Aleene's glues.  This is my newest love because it can be dry cleaned and holds fast.  Think Patches on Jackets,  Gym Bags etc.Second best feature, it will hold fabric to poster board, wood, almost anything and drys clear.  Ialso buy the Jumbo size Tacky Glue from Aleene  She makes really great products at a really good price",5
B00178QSE6,"Love this product. Strong, clear. Well worth the money.",5
B00178QSE6,Pretty sure I used it correctly but it wouldn't hold the 2 pieces of felt material together.,2
B00178QSE6,Works perfect,5
B00178QSE6,"I thought this would be a quick fix. However,  it just stayed wet about an hour.  I was working on repairing lining in a purse. It also left a white residue. Pretty underwhelmed with product.  It could have been a bad batch... but i will stick with what I use regularly. Just hoped this was even better.",2
B00178QSE6,I was surprised that it worked so well.,4
B00178QSE6,It's not very strong. Works well for some minor issues but not a permanent fix. Also I think it depends on the fabric.,3
B00178QSE6,"Works like it should! I don't sew, don't have a sewing machine. I don't even know how to use an iron properly. So this glue is a lifesaver if you need to glue patches on to something like a bag, jacket, hat, etc.. Easy to use and not messy.",5
B00178QSE6,I bought this in a desperate attempt to save my favorite pair of pants as they had ripped in an awkward spot on the outside of the thigh. I didn't know how to sew denim and gave this a go hoping it would be strong enough and unnoticable. After following the instructions it actually ended up leaving a big wet looking mark that was rough. It was terrible and drew even more attention then what it was with the wrip.I also understand that it's probably meant to be used on other things so maybe it would be good for other things. Just don't use it on your clothes.,2
B00178QSE6,"This worked perfectly for applying appliques on something I couldn't embroider over. I also repaired a cut in fabric with it along with some sheer material. Good stuff, and handy!",5
B00178QSE6,"Used to glue up a oscillating bag which had a ruptured end, worked extremely well and has withstood rigorous use, worked better than sewing for sure",5
B00178QSE6,"The product description said that the adhesive is flexible, but I found that it is not. I used it to fix slippery yarn ends together to keep it stable and when it was dry it is hard and scratchy. It probably works like a dream but not for the purpose that I purchased it for.  If you know of a fabric adhesive that is truly soft and flexible let me know and I will be the first to purchase it. Thank you.",3
B00178QSE6,This is a good adhesive but not for my need which was to fix my jersey patches.... tried different methods and weights on the patch but in the end will use it for cloth materials,3
B00178QSE6,Not as useful as Tear Mender...But good for holding before sewing,4
B00178QSE6,will keep for other use,4
B00178QSE6,Works like a charm,5
B00178QSE6,Must buy,5
B00178QSE6,Works great,5
B00178QSE6,I have never been a good seamstress so this is a great help to me when something goes wrong . I recently used it on a pair of pants and it worked perfectly.,5
B00178QSE6,Easy to use and it really does adhere to the fabric.,5
B00178QSE6,"I made a quilt for my daughter and because she loves it so much 2 plastic pieces, in the literal middle of the top of the quilt, were coming off. I researched what I could use to attach the plastic piece back to the fabric square without it ruining the entire quilt AND something that would actually stick. Well I finally decided on this and it worked. This was used to attach 2 small plastic pieces about the sizes of nickels to fabric. I was extremely worried that it would bleed through to the back of the quilt...but it didn't. I assume this is b/c the batting was in the middle of the top and bottom pieces but still, I'm calling it a win. The glue was a little runnier than I expected, not quite as thick as Elmers school glue. And the adhesive did dry clear but noticeable if you look closely where some of it oozed out. Overall I am THRILLED! Fingers crossed it'll hold when I wash the quilt in a week or so.",4
B00178QSE6,I bought this glue to hold some Paracord for some knife wraps and a mask project. It dries quickly and holds fabric together very well. Not even the harsh conditions I put it through have affected the effectiveness of the adhesive.,5
B00178QSE6,"I bougth this to glue a 2"" wide by 35"" Velcro strip on a Cyclone Rake collection bag that's inside stitching was cut by debris entering the  bag.  I coated both the bag and the strip with ""Fabric Fusion"" and tightly clamped the pieces together between two  2"" x 4"" plank and left it to cure for four days.  When the clamps were removed thie strip was found not to adhere AT ALL and was easily peeled off.  I did not test ""Fabric Fusion"" with any other fabrics so can't speak for adherence with other material , but it definited does not work with nylon fabrfic and whatever fabric are used to back Velcro strips!",3
B00178QSE6,"While I enjoyed the convenience of not having to remove the pesky foil on a new bottle of glue, it does not make up for the need to use a toothpick to clear out the gunk from the pre-cut hole at the top, which because of its size caused too much glue to come up on the patch I was attempting to re-glue. Unfortunately, the glue doesn't dry clear as indicated, and thus I ruined the garment when it oozed out around the patch due to my inability to control the flow. The glue itself held pretty well, so if you decide to purchase, I would recommend care when applying.",1
B00178QSE6,"This is a valuable product.  You can't be stingy with it; it needs to be applied according to the instructions.  I am very happy with it.  I used it to repair jeans, a pair of sneakers and a chair's fabric seat.  I got great results.  I recommend this product.",5
B00178QSE6,"I'm very happy with this glue. I used it to attach patches on my jeans. After the glue dried, I tried to pull the patches off. They held tight. I'll purchase this again!",5

B06XW45PMR,Buen precio,5
B06XW45PMR,"paper becomes very brittle if the fold intersection exceeds 2 for some of the colors (e.g. purple, red, orange). the smoother paper (e.g. navy) folds like a dream. overall- you get what you pay for.",3
B06XW45PMR,Good paper for origami,5
B06XW45PMR,"My students refused to use this paper because it's. not white on one side and all their YouTube videos show white on one side. So, i used it for a collage project",3
B06XW45PMR,I bought this for a fun activity for my middle school students. The paper is nice and great for origami.,5
B06XW45PMR,They are thin colorful papers. I use them in my collage art. I like the fact that they are thin and glue well. You get a lot in the package.,5
B06XW45PMR,Colors and shape are great.  My son used them to teach a Japanese summer class and said he thought they were just a tiny bit too thick.,4
B06XW45PMR,"The paper is thinner than I would like, but it is crisp. Some of the colors are less smooth and crisp. It's not something I'd buy again, but it will do in a pinch.",3
B06XW45PMR,My daughter likes it and uses them a lot,5
B06XW45PMR,Good directions,5
B06XW45PMR,Great for origami beginners. Vibrant colors that could potentially create interesting patterns and contrasts. Great value for the money.,4
B06XW45PMR,"I would not call this paper origami paper because it doesn't have a good texture or hold folds the way you expect from origami paper. It's practice paper at best. If you have a project that requires colored square paper, where quality isn't a factor, this is great for the price! If you want to fold origami, skip. The paper is cheap, rough, and the folds are not clean or crisp. I should have known at the price. We had to keep the paper since my child dug into it, and we use it for school projects.",3
B06XW45PMR,"This really is a fantastic set of paper. There are 500 sheets in an array of colors making it the perfect set for origami, complementing any origami making books. My daughter is an artist and loves making things with her hands, so for her birthday I thought this would be something fun for her and me to do together. The paper is the right thickness, so not too thick, it's just right for all the folding you need to do during origami. I thought getting a large set of paper would be best and save us money, while we are learning to fold. As we get better then I'll get us the Japanese printed paper as our skill level increases. I can't wait to start learning how to make origami, there are so many fun things to make, and this lot of paper is going to be really helpful.",5
B06XW45PMR,The quality is more of like precut construction paper. Not the same as the origami style paper that you get when origami books. Good value and does the job. Got this for my 8 year old because he's been interested in origami and been using our printing paper.,4
B06XW45PMR,My son is into origami and he loved this paper!,5
B06XW45PMR,Come on folks it is paper. the colors are strong and paper is excellent in the end result,5
B06XW45PMR,Paper is very easy to work with. Colors are really nice and bright. Kids are enjoying working on origami projects.,5
B06XW45PMR,Good quality paper for the price! My son was happy to get to make more origami!,4
B06XW45PMR,"My daughter had to make things to ""sell"" for Market Day at school. This picture shows the original origami paper she started with that had one side color and this one with both sides colored. She said this paper was easy to work with and she liked that both sides had color.",5
B06XW45PMR,Always purchase items for my grandkids' visits.  Origami paper was plentiful (200 pieces) and easy to work with as the patterns and pieces we construct work perfectly.,5
B06XW45PMR,"Like at least one other reviewer, when I read ""double-sided,"" I thought that the company was advertising that it contains different colors on each side, which is what I thought one is supposed to expect with origami paper. This is partially my fault for not knowing what they meant, but clearer language should be used if the company knows that customers expect origami paper to have two different colors on the two sides, which ""double-sided"" could be interpreted as meaning. The lack of differentiation between color on the two sides makes it harder to see your folds and also makes the paper less worth paying for, since you could just make it yourself by cutting up colored paper.Besides that, the paper is not the smooth, uniform-feeling origami paper that I am used to. It feels like cheap, thin paper that has simply been cut into the shape of a square. I am personally finding that the paper also kind of bulges in a way that makes your origami work look sloppy, even when after reinforcing the folds by sliding your fingernail across them. I originally gave this product 3 stars, but I am now finding that the bulging is because these papers are not actually square, which is a big inconvenience and defeats the purpose of buying pre-cut paper.The papers would be good for teaching a large group of people origami if you want to save money.They could also be good if you want to save money in general and/or don't want to cut a bunch of squares yourself.However, I would NOT otherwise recommend them for ease of use, quality, or clean-looking origami pieces.",2
B06XW45PMR,My daughter uses this for origami and she says she would rather have paper that is two colors: one on the front and a different on the back. It helps with certain origami designs and keeping track of which side you're working with.,4
B06XW45PMR,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Is a nice origami papers for DIY they work fine and perfectly square,5
B06XW45PMR,Students loved learning some simple origami patterns during summer school enrichment classes. Great value for the price and good quality for classroom use.,5
B06XW45PMR,My daughter was learning origami in school. We ordered these per her request. Nice color pallet and she liked the quality of the paper.,4
B06XW45PMR,Got to make all kinds of little animals and the paper showed up in a timely manner,5
B06XW45PMR,I didn't realize how small the paper is. I am afraid that it will be difficult to work with.,3
B06XW45PMR,Bigger sheets for bigger ideas!,5
B06XW45PMR,"I don't recommend this paper if you want to improve at origami. I've been folding and teaching origami for about 15 years now. This paper is pretty weak and is not a good fit for intermediate and advanced models. I could manage closed sinks with it, but a less experienced folder will likely tear the paper when doing more advanced manuevers. It's fine if you're sticking to simple models, but if you're an intermediate folder who wants to get better, don't get this paper.",3
B06XW45PMR,Making origami,5
B06XW45PMR,"I got this pack because I was making a LOT of origami dioramas as low cost Christmas gifts since I was short on money this year.~ If you don't have the money, put in the time, and that I did.~ This colorful pack was great for what I needed since this was my first time making such different kinds of origami, and the abundance of each color allowed me to make mistakes and retry with a fresh sheet without worrying about running out of that color.~ each fold left me crisp lines that left the final product even better!~ I only wish they added white too, but it's not that big of a breaking point!~ Still have a lot of paper left, and now I'm better at origami!~",5
B06XW45PMR,"The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is because the paper set comes with 2 textures of paper (some of the colors are one texture, some are the other), and one texture is easier to fold than the other. The less easy one is a bit more construction-paper like? Still though, you get a lot of paper for a great price, and that's exactly what I wanted! I will probably order again if I run out (which will take a bit of time-I just do this for fun sometimes).",4
B06XW45PMR,Quality paper or origami.  I bought a couple origami how-to books and the paper was a welcome addition allowing the young crafters to get started right away.,5
B06XW45PMR,I've always been intrigued by origami and decided to spend some time learning it during my break from work. This paper is perfectly sized for creating origami art. It's easy for a beginner to fold--not flimsy or hard to work with. The variety of colors is also nice. I recommend it for anyone wanting to try origami.,5
B06XW45PMR,"Great colors, just that some have a weird dot on them",4
B06XW45PMR,"The shape, thickness and size of origami paper. But the texture was simply very thin construction paper. It is not origami feel at all. Because of this folds are difficult to hold properly.",3
B06XW45PMR,"There are a lot of sheets for a low price, so it is a ""good value for the money."" However, this doesn't hold up as well as origami paper like I used to use. Maybe this is how origami paper is now, but I remember it being much sturdier 20 years ago (it was thin, but still sturdy). This just feels like really thin cardboard paper. It is fine for the price, cause I didn't spend a lot of money on it. Good for introductory origami, because it's not a huge investment if they don't do it as much.",3
B06XW45PMR,"The quality of the paper is pretty good, definitely not the best and obviously not the worst. I found that it was a little difficult holding creases and folds. A lot of the times when you had an origami with a lot of required folds, by the time you got to the end the paper would thin out so much that sometimes you'd get small holes. It is also hard knowing which side to fold because of the color on both sides, but marking one side easily fixes that.Point is this is a good product and I would reccomend it for smaller, less complex origami folds and for small projects. The paper is strong and sturdy enough for smaller ones, but a project complex like a crane would cause the end product to have holes in areas where the paper has been folded or ""used"" the most. For it's price I'd say it is well worth it and definitely got me back into origami folding.",4
B06XW45PMR,"I ordered this to complete my goal this year of making 1000 paper cranes. The paper is decent and folds nicely. Now I am only making paper cranes so depending in what you're making might changes quality, foldability of the paper. The size of paper is great. I actually made the paper even smaller by folding and tearing it into 4 versus the one. Also I have noticed while folding the different colors the thickness of the paper changes a bit. Some are thinner which makes tearing at folds more susceptible. Overall it's cheap paper and great for beginners and making most stuff.",4
B06XW45PMR,and tore while folding.,3
B06XW45PMR,Quality was fine- the description was frustrating for people looking for origami paper with two different color sides,2
B06XW45PMR,And it is foldable.,5
B06XW45PMR,Nice Origami paper quality.The good thing is the quality of the paper is very good compared to other sellers. Seems like a decent quantity of paper with the good price.Got roughly around about 20 different color papers with 6 x 6 inches.,5
B06XW45PMR,You won't be disappointed in this pack of origami paper,5
B06XW45PMR,"My kid loved making origami for weeks with this, and sharing papers with his friends. I loved the low cost of the pack. He said it was the perfect size, he usually has to cut paper to do origami but this worked perfectly for him and he loved the color selection. Definitely a must buy again product!",5
B06XW45PMR,"Paper was very thin, and easy ripped when using it for intricate folds with the paper. Good color selection, although it did come with double the amount of light yellow paper than the rest of the colors. Size was as described.",2
B06XW45PMR,"If you want 500 sheets for cheap, this is great. The quality leaves a lot to be desired, so if you're looking for strong paper keep looking.Also most of the dark blue had a hole punched though the corner, and some of the pink were dented where it looks like the hole punch couldn't poke through",3
B06XW45PMR,This oragami paper worked wonderfully for my colorful New Year's cranes.Some oragami paper is white on one side and colored on the other. This paper has color on both sides.Happy folding!,5
B06XW45PMR,"The paper is decent quality and makes tight creases.  However, it's missing a huge aspect of what makes Origami paper special:  the two-tone color.  Both sides of the paper are the same color, so you don't get the color contrast in the finished models.",3
B06XW45PMR,"I bought this as a gift for my young godsister who's into origami these days. The price, quantity, and color selection are quite nice. She's enjoyed folding along with YouTube tutorials, and the paper is just the right thickness for a beginner.",5
B06XW45PMR,Super flexible paper that is easy to fold. My students love trying out different origami with these papers. They come in a ton of colors and affordable for them to make mistakes and try again.,5
B06XW45PMR,Although there are no patterns this paper is good and thin in a way that is very helpful for folding oragami. The paper size is even so you can cut it into small squares with non leftover to make even smaller pieces.,4
B06XW45PMR,"I needed some origami paper and I didn't want to spend a lot of money as it was for a cub scout activity.This was perfect for my use. There were enough pieces of paper that I could practice prior to the activity. This enabled me to have a few samples of what we were going to fold. Also, if a child messed up I was able to just give them another piece because there were so many pieces.I liked that they were square because then i didn't have to sit there and make a bunch of typing or colored paper pieces square. This was simply open up the package and start following directions.Enjoy.",5
B06XW45PMR,My 8-year-old son loves origami.  This paper gives him tons of colorful options!  Good stuff to keep your kid occupied!Big Rudy,5
B06XW45PMR,Bought these cause I thought they would be bigger. My mistake. They are tiny pieces to use for exactly what it says they are used for. So they work great for oragami but not me.,5
B06XW45PMR,"We have enjoyed the origami papers so far. My kids gave made about 50 ninja stars from then and only one paper has ripped. They seem pretty good quality especially for beginners and kids. The box is nice to keep them all contained, i like the velcro, but the writing on the back is very bad English. Haha made me laugh to read it. I think the company might need some help there.",5
B06XW45PMR,I like the size and variety of colors.,4
B06XW45PMR,"It's nearly tissue-paper thin, and creases so easily you will get a lot of undesired marks as you try to assemble your intended folds. I just folded a paper crane as a test, and while it does have enough structure to hold the shape, it just feels cheap and unsatisfying to touch, even when assembled. Well, just have 199 sheets to go. Maybe it'll at least be good to practice with so I don't waste nice paper.",1
B06XW45PMR,These were great for kids to use in class!,5
B06XW45PMR,"This was a gift to a young person who has been teaching herself origami from videos. She's gotten quite good at it, so after research on the various papers, settled on this one. Very nice to use and easy to fold and the colors are great. Already had to purchase another pack. Well worth it.",5
B06XW45PMR,"For someone doing a one-off project or trying to learn this is the paper to buy. it is a good size and easy not too thick to get good folds. If you really enjoy origami then you can always move to the more expensive and ""prettier"" paper once you've got a handle on the folding.I actually needed to fold a huge number of paper cranes for a project at work and did not want to spend too much on the paper.  I was worried that due to the lower price the quality would not be very good, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I found this paper easy to work with and all of the different colored cranes looked happy (for paper cranes that is).  Happy folding!",5
B06XW45PMR,"I really like the verity of colors, and the size is just right for most all the projects",5
B06XW45PMR,May daughter loves making different types of designs. She opens youtube app to have some ideas of what to make. Very entertaining,5
B06XW45PMR,"I rarely had origami paper when I was younger so I made my own by taking a sheet of printer paper, folding a triangle, and cutting off the remainder that wasn't part of the triangle. This ensured I had a perfect square and made origami for me fun when each consecutive fold ended up in perfectly lined edges and pointy... points(?). I started off with a diagonal fold to get a triangle with this paper, expecting the edges to line up, but it didn't. So I had to use a scissor. Probably good for other uses unless you're as picky as me about pointy points and lined edges.",4
B06XW45PMR,Hi.  All origami paper should be double sided...meaning one side has color and the reverse is white.  This is cheap paper and both sides are the same color.  Don't know why this is called origami paper.,4
B06XW45PMR,Such a great buy! Some paper is different in texture but I don't care. Theyve been easy to fold and make nice sharp creases. I've been able to use this for so many fun and cute projects at work. I will be buying this paper again.,5
B06XW45PMR,"Colorful, good quality",5
B06XW45PMR,"Thin construction paper, not two toned and low quality",2
B06XW45PMR,"Thin paper. Didn't feel very high quality.I didn't really like the colours, they are all lighter than the photo shown.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,"I use these glue dots to stick cardstock labels onto jars of jam, and the work as expected to hold the labels in place. They are quite sticky, so it takes a little work to remove to readjust, but they continue to stick well, even after removing and replacing.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"Essential for events! I usually only have one small roll of glue dots that come included with balloon arch kits and I always run out. This set of 1000 was so cheap & will be awesome to have on hand. Comes in multiple rolls, which makes it more functional for use. Dots adhere to balloons well & hold longer than needed, which makes setting up balloon arches so easy.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"Excellent, sticky glue dots. Great for hanging kids artwork or making balloon arches.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"THese sticky dots work great. Don't pick them off the backing strip!!!  They will stick to your fingers and turn into a sticky lump.Look at the backing, locate the dot, and press to the backside corner of the thing you want to mount onto paper, such as an album page. Be careful not to overlap the next sticky dot when pressing. Get a dot onto each corner, then line up your item to the page carefully and then press into place.The dots can be removed but be careful. Pull with gentlenness and after a few seconds all the dot will release from the mounting. It can pull off a little of the mounting paper, too, but if you watch the dot letting go, you'll know how slowly and yet firmly to pull. The dot will probably get mangled and need to be thrown away.This is a good way to mount photos or papers onto paper pages. Once you get the hang of pressing the dots to back corners and mounting, your project will move right along. The dots will still stick even if you mangle them but then it'll be more like a lump of sticky rather than a flat dot.I wouldn't use this for anything that needs to be glued all over, but if a bit of stick on 2 or 4 corners of something is all you need to keep it in place, this stuff works great.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,Hard to get off of the roll without sticking to other things. Dots do not remain dots if you try to remove them. Best way to use is to press the dot to something rather than remove to put where you need it. If you remove it from the paper it becomes a ball basically. Pretty sticky and worked okay for lightweight paper/ribbon.,4
B0BDDJCSVN,Easy to use.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,I really enjoy using these in my scrap books. Hold things in place. Very happy with purchase.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,These little guys work great and there are a lot!!!,4
B0BDDJCSVN,Buena compra.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"The dots are sticky; overall, it's not bad for the price.",4
B0BDDJCSVN,Worked well. Adding candy onto cardstock,4
B0BDDJCSVN,"These are very thin. More like a fairly round(-ish), printed or rolled smear on the backing strip, than they are an actual, well defined 'dot'. They lack structural integrity, but... that's not necessarily a bad thing. These are like the adhesive you get with cards in the mail; to hold them in place on the paper. The adhesive is easy to apply by pressing the strip into place, and then pulling it off (the strip acting as the cover for the next turn/set of 'dots' on the roll; thus alleviating having to remove individual covers). Actually easier/quicker than with the thicker, more structurally integrous dots; which are usually provided on a larger, square backing, with individual peel-offs/covers for each individual dot.  I had a furry/cloth covered, heated cat pad that I wanted to be held in place on my glass desktop. Previous application of nine 1/2"" dia. (thicker) dots had failed, over a period of 6 or 8 weeks. Instead of going through the mildly laborious apply/peel-off-cover process for a larger number of dots, this time - say... a grid of 16 dots - I decided to use these thinner ones. I simply cut 4 strips, laid them down in 4 parallel rows, then easily/quickly peeled off the backing strip. Viola!! 48 'dots' applied in under a minute!  Easier to remove, also. They roll up with a finger tip; just like the ones used in the mail, mentioned above.  To sum up - very thin, but easier to apply/remove; and more convenient/appropriate for certain applications. I ordered more of the thicker dots, however, as they, also, have their more appropriate applications, too.  Recommended, with applicable caveats.",4
B0BDDJCSVN,They hold really well,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Admittedly the brand names don't fold up as much as this one. But these do work really well. And I would recommend those for anyone wanting to save money and don't mind the little fold up,4
B0BDDJCSVN,They worked for me but it would have been easier if they were able to tear off the roll,4
B0BDDJCSVN,"I was planning a class party and decided to use these to attach cardboard leaves to a tree instead of regular glue to make it more ""3D"".  They turned out perfectly and I would like to say less messy.  I've also used these to make balloon arches and they hold up the balloons very nicely.  I would definitely buy these again!",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"These things are great! I was able to use these along with fishing line and a little cardboard to make my son a balloon dragon for his 3rd birthday party (and frankly it was a lot of fun to do). Without these little glue dots that wouldn't have been possible. I will say that there is a learning curve to using them- you'll want to loop the tape around the finger you would use to apply them and apply the dot with a little roll movement directly from the tape to the balloon rather than trying to remove it by hand and reapply it (this makes the first dot a bit tricky because there is no tape to loop with). Still, it made a big craft project a much easier task than it would have been otherwise.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,Son bastantes y ahieren bastante bien,5
B0BDDJCSVN,THIS DOESNT DAMAGE WALLS!! It holds well. Used it to put balloons on the wall and this thing saved me so much time. Definitely using more often for birthdays!,5
B0BDDJCSVN,I use these at work to put graduation announcements on my windows. About 1 in every 10 dots decide not to stick more than 24 hours... I'm not sure if it's temperature fluctuation or what but that's why I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5.,4
B0BDDJCSVN,Didn't think it was going to work except it works great remove easy durable can reuse again,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Perfecto para pegar los globos,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Hold very well..,4
B0BDDJCSVN,Very easy to use and a must have for party decorations,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"I used these glue to line shelves at my home and they worked perfectly, much better than the original brand, which I also tried.  Great value for the money and easy to remove to adhere to drawers and liner",5
B0BDDJCSVN,Nothing bad to say,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Oops this is like a gummy gel droplet Not what I was looking for.,4
B0BDDJCSVN,Good for the Classroom to have.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Good for what they are intended for!,5
B0BDDJCSVN,I like it,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"I love these. I've only been using them for small light weight crafts but they stick pretty good. i also think (for what im using them for atleast) they're decently easy to remove.I was stuck between this brand vs the gorilla glue version and was wondering if the G.G. have a stronger grip, so I was unsure about buying these ones because I wasn't sure if they wouldn't hold too good. but ended up buying this brand because they were cheaper and you get a LOT more then the g.g. ones. so I really have nothing to compare these to because it's the 1st time I've ever used this sort of ""glue"" but for small craft projects I love them.they're sorta like, glue stickers? like picture a small little jelly dot thats really sticky. they aren't flat btwit be good if they were a little flatter. but all in all 5 stars.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"I purchased these for a card class I am teaching.  I put the amount of glue dots per card in each kit, but am unable to do that with this product, as these are not covered on both sides.  so this will not be able to be used as intended.  For a personal use these would be great but not for a class use as the reason for purchase.",2
B0BDDJCSVN,Decorations holds well,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"Great on wood or regular walls, but you have to use several and it has to be very light weight.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,"The glue dots worked for a short while.  However, after 24 hours things started falling off the decorative peice I made, including paper, which is the easiest to stay sticking to something.  The idea is good, but the glue strength needs to be increased.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,"Considering the price and the quantity, I expected these glue dots to be only okay, but they were perfect! Really easy to dispense and use, and they definitely hung in there. Will order again and again!",5
B0BDDJCSVN,Need these to do a balloon arch for my nephews first birthday and it worked great,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Great value same as the big name brands. Packaging could have been a little better. They come on loose rolls no box dispensing. We tried them for a promotional product and they worked great.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"These worked FANTASTIC for all parties we've had over the years. Holding down corners of picnic table table cloths, balloon arches, attaching photos, etc. They hold up WONDERFULLY!",5
B0BDDJCSVN,I originally bought these to help make cheer bows and these were thin enough to not make the 1.5 inch ribbon they gave me bulk up. I was also making greeting cards and had forgotten my double sided tape roll at my other house so I ended up using these and they worked excellently. I read in a review to press it to one surface firmly before gently peeling off the back and that worked perfectly. I only wasted 2 when I accidentally touched them with my hand. They're spaced close together so that part can be tricky but not once you get the hang of it. Great value!,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"These removable adhesive dots are great! I bought them to help stick some photos on paper, and they worked as expected. The dots are super sticky yet come off easily if you need to remove or replace them. The only thing I don't like is that they are spaced closely, so I accidentally grabbed two sometimes. This isn't the worst thing ever, but it's just something I noticed.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,Worked for what I needed it for.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,The sticky dots don't stick well and come off easily.,2
B0BDDJCSVN,"This was my first time using glue dots. I purchased them for special project. And now I use them on everything.I think the thing I like best about them is they are removable without lead sticky messes everywhere. This is a good brand, and I definitely would buy it again.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"Love the roller packaging,  it makes for easy application. Such a large amount for the price. There has been no damage to my walls after removing them.",4
B0BDDJCSVN,"These are stronger than the ones you can get at the craft store. Sometimes they take a little more effort  to remove, but I havent had an issue getting it all off. Sometimes it's hard to get them on the item flat, it just depends on what it is. I make mixed media art and I use these to place things, so I can see how it looks, and be able to move items around until I am happy with the placement, before gluing them down. They would work well for kids crafts too. These are much more economical than the ones in the store.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,The glue kept sticking to the other side.,3
B0BDDJCSVN,These glue dots were ok but not as strong as described.,3
B0BDDJCSVN,These are probably the best ones I have used,5
B0BDDJCSVN,I use these to keep my drawing in place with I am creating templates.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"I'm finding all kinds of uses for them. I've stuck insoles into my shoes, stuck a box of tissue to the floor mat of my car, put up photos on the refrigerator, and more. They can be a little tricky to peel off the paper without stretching or rolling them, but it didn't take much practice to get the hang of it.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,I used these for birthday decorations. I did have to use quite a few so it would hold. I did not give this product 5 stars because it did take the paint off my walls. I will use them again but this time I will be more mindful of that.,4
B0BDDJCSVN,There's nothing I dislike about these. I use them to anchor fabric to stabilizer when I embroider. They are easily removed & leave no residue. I'll keep buying these as long as the price stays the same. You cant beat the price for what you get.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,I have used them on stained and unstained wood and they stick great. They also come off without messing up the wood.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"I purchased these to post photos to photo boards for my sons open house. They hold the photos well... too well. The glue dots WILL NOT COME OFF the photos! I have had to cut corners of photos in order to keep photos, some have even been ruined. Only use these of you plan to not remove the photos again.",2
B0BDDJCSVN,We hung a small banner at night and it had dropped by the morning.,2
B0BDDJCSVN,"I used it to stick the back side of the labels for garment bags, as the labels were falling off from the pouch.It did its work. and we were able to remove the labels glued very easily.I recommend this to all. easy to use and remove.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,Works as intended but pulled the paint off the walls and ceiling when trying to remove.,2
B0BDDJCSVN,Bought for someone else,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"We used this to adhere plastic snowflakes shown in the pictures to our wall. Removing them destroyed the wall; please see the photos where you can see tears in the wall where the snowflakes were. The snowflakes kept falling off the wall even though they were small and lightweight. The glue is very hard to remove from these snowflakes, at least. I would not recommend these adhesives.",1
B0BDDJCSVN,I have used several of these. They are handy,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"They weren't great at holding balloons to the wall/ceiling for more than like an hour at most. They did help balloons stick to each other, but that was it.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,"Easy to use and easy to remove, but the glue dots are very small",4
B0BDDJCSVN,very strong and worked perfectly for my flower wall!!!,5
B0BDDJCSVN,"I had no issues to use, the tape was of good quality and was easy to remove. it was use for a birthday party.",2
B0BDDJCSVN,If you need something easy to hold balloons up then this is ur go to,5
B0BDDJCSVN,These glue dots are great for kids to use on their own.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Lots and lots of glue dots to go around our art class! Saved the day with the little kids and no messy glue. Win win in my book.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,Excellent value - Cheaper than zots which is what i started using. Will buy again.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,A little bit hard to take out when working with paper crafts. But super sticky!,4
B0BDDJCSVN,Does not hold as well as I would like.  I used this to put VERY VERY lightweight wood ornaments on a wood door and it did NOT hold at all well.,3
B0BDDJCSVN,These glue dots helped putting together a balloon arrangement. They help ok. Could of been a bet sticker.,4
B0BDDJCSVN,"I bought these for my kids to hang their posters on the wall. One on each edge didn't work, so we lined the back on one of the posters with like 12 of em. They held for about an hour, then the poster fell!",2
B0BDDJCSVN,"i am using  for scrapbooking ,very easy ,order got here fast, thanks!",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"These are poor quality, difficult to use without them balling up when you remove them, and if I didn't need them right now, I would have returned them.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,Easy to apply and use.,5
B0BDDJCSVN,I love getting a big supply I use these within the daycare to stick holiday posters or reminders.,4
B0BDDJCSVN,"I needed a supply of at least 400 which is way less than this item of 2500 glue dots. But the price was good so I gave them a try. I do paper crafting, primarily card making. I have struggled with glue dot applicators and dots on rolls like this. These are by far the best. I cut into a section of 4 then carefully applied to the corners of the piece to be glued. They remove easily from the strip (apply from the paper strip to your item then pull the backing away). I occasionally got my fingers in the way and messed up a glue dot but with practice got fairly proficient.  I highly recommend.",5
B0BDDJCSVN,"These are probably fine for small or temporary crafts, but don't expect that you can hang anything with these for any length of time. Sheets of paper wouldn't stay on a flat, texture less wall, for more than a day. They are cheap and easy to use though.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,"If you want to stick papers together or just some light items on something these are working perfectly and easy to use, but they are not strong enough for something against gravity (stick something on the ceiling as for example), unless maybe as light as balloons.So they are just good for some uses, don't expect too much.",3
B0BDDJCSVN,"This is kind of a 'get what you pay for' case. They aren't the best, but you really get a lot for a relatively cheap price. They don't have the strongest hold, but for small/lightweight things it works great as they are easy to apply. Once you apply it you can't really move it anywhere else. I would say it really just depends on what you're planning to use them for, but they aren't bad at all.",4
B0BDDJCSVN,Sticky but easy to peal off. Just what I needed for hanging paper signs,5
B079VWBFHF,"These cost a bit more than the off brand mats but they last longer. The ""grip"" works better on these after frequent use. I have tried another brand but did not get as much use out of it. The extra cost is worth it",5
B079VWBFHF,"Cricut brand really does work better for mats. These are authentic, ship fast and affordable. Durable, grips well with just the right amount of stickiness. Definitely recommend.",5
B079VWBFHF,New to arts and crafts........this product works fine and cost is great!,5
B079VWBFHF,Very nice! No problems at all. They work great. Will buy again in the future.,5
B079VWBFHF,"I love these longer matts, and use them with  my vinyl rolls to create wall decals. They have a good grip. Worth the cost and would recommend.",5
B079VWBFHF,12 inch standard mat. Flexible. Fits perfect. Cutting board quality is 10 out of 10. Its stickey as well.,5
B079VWBFHF,I have used the generic strong grip mats but the Cricut official mats just work better for me.,5
B079VWBFHF,These mats are made well they are a good size to have and are very functional,4
B079VWBFHF,I don't usually buy Cricuit brand because I didn't feel they were as good as other brands like Silhouette or Oracle or Easy Weed.  These seem to be nice.  I prefer a light tackiness so my papers don't tear when I try to pull them off.  I make intricate 3-D box cards and sometimes the pieces are tiny or delicate.  These seem to have a bit too much tackiness so using an old t-shirt and pressing it a few times can help it be slightly less tacky.,5
B079VWBFHF,Bought this for a Christmas gift and that person loves using. It has come in handy for her projects,5
B079VWBFHF,Always buy Cricut Mats as they seem to stay up the longest!,5
B079VWBFHF,"It's exactly what you would expect from Cricut. I have tried cleaning and washing my mats in the past but I prefer to replace them because they just wear out. If you get a multi pack, it saves you money - I probably buy this once a year. Recommend!",5
B079VWBFHF,"I got these mats and it was a great deal for them. I did find that the ones I got were overly sticky for being lightgrip mats. I've had to press them against my shirts and put my hands all over them, as well as use a lightly powered towel on them to get them to be less sticky. My cardstock and my vinyl were sticking very hard to the mat and destroying my materials until I got the sticky to calm down.",5
B079VWBFHF,Super sticker and easy to use,5
B079VWBFHF,True to size. Work good for everything my daughter needed then for. Good grip not to thick and easy to clean when finished,5
B079VWBFHF,Like these for my fabric projects wirh my Cricut,5
B079VWBFHF,Did not bend/snap in delivery! Very great value for 3 12 x 24 cricut mats!!,5
B079VWBFHF,"I tried all of the other mats but Cricut mats are different, they dont loose their stickiness so easy. Wash and continue.",5
B079VWBFHF,The Cricut FabricGrip Adhesive Cutting Mats are my go-to for cutting fabric with my Cricut Maker 3. They have the perfect amount of stickiness and hold the fabric well.,5
B079VWBFHF,Cost less than purchasing from name brand company. Great stickiness.,4
B079VWBFHF,Cutting cardstock.,5
B079VWBFHF,"Because I think Cricuit brand is probably the best, when you can get a deal on the prices take it. However, I use the ""off brands"" also with good results. When these are on sale, I buy several and add them to my stash for when a mat is beyond repair. Also, I wash these mats and keep them relatively sticky by using a lint roller to keep them going as long as possible.",5
B079VWBFHF,They worked perfect for Air2.,5
B079VWBFHF,Sticks well for fabric. Easy to use and clean.,5
B079VWBFHF,These are the light grip cutting mats and they work best for the projects I do with my Cricut. It is easy to pull off the vinyl when complete.,5
B079VWBFHF,Perfect quality cricut mats.,5
B079VWBFHF,The Cricut Standard Grip Mats have a stronger hold than the Lightweight Mat that came with my Cricut Explorer 2 Machine. The stronger grip made small letter cutting easy to remove without bending to the letters.,5
B079VWBFHF,It keeps saying next day delivery....next day I check and it's running late and just disappears in tracking so I have to cancel.  What is it with these.....don't tell me next day if it's never going to get here.,5
B079VWBFHF,vinyl sticks great.,5
B079VWBFHF,"Cricut brand for a great price! Makes crafting so much easier because I'm able to run bigger projects through at once, definitely recommend!",5
B079VWBFHF,"Have used other brands, but always come back to Cricut Standard Grip. Overpriced normally, but Prime Days is worth waiting for!",5
B079VWBFHF,Great grip. These mats are perfect for my fabric cutting.These clean easily with a baby wipe for any left over fabric stings or lint.Great price for 3 mats.,5
B079VWBFHF,Works great.,5
B079VWBFHF,Exactly as I expected,5
B079VWBFHF,good product,5
B079VWBFHF,"Using felt on the cricut burns through mats. I wish they were cheaper, because even cleaning them and trying to get the stick back, it doesn't work... at least not with felt. The machine would bunch up the material as it was cutting, and then would not do a great job cutting and then would error out! These mats held the felt for longer than the regular grip mats. Still wish I could get more milage out of the mats, but such is the way these things are built, I guess.",5
B079VWBFHF,It was a gift and my daughter who is into crafts loved tem.,5
B079VWBFHF,Used for my Cricut machine. Mats are sticky enough but came bent. Still usable but they are definitely bent,3
B079VWBFHF,There is way to much adhesive sometimes you can hardly remove the vinyl . sometimes if tears,3
B079VWBFHF,A must have for the cricut. Good price!,5
B079VWBFHF,"I've tried several brands of the copycats, and none keep the adhesion as long as the Cricut mats. My cardstock sticks well, and I can use this mat many times without losing the stickiness. I'm going to stick with Cricut from now on, because even though it costs more up front, the lifetime cost makes it the best value.",5
B079VWBFHF,Love the longer Mat.  The same as standard ones only longer for bigger jobs.,5
B079VWBFHF,Great price on Cricut mats,5
B079VWBFHF,Arrived in good condition.  Works as intended.  Great value.,5
B079VWBFHF,Good mats. You have to renew the stickiness after some use.,5
B079VWBFHF,"These are good but they are a little bit expensive, so just make sure you do your research before picking any brand",4
B079VWBFHF,Perfect for making stickers on my cricut! Grippy enough to hold the sheets in place but not so sticky that it's hard to peel everything off once it's done cutting.Really like that it has a neatly printed grid on it. The hole on the top of these mats makes it great to hang up to get out of the way. They're fairly lightweight and have good flexibility. All in all I'm super pleased with these!,5
B079VWBFHF,"Excelente producto, material bastante bueno",5
B079VWBFHF,"I only use these mats, they work great",5
B079VWBFHF,"This offer for Cricut brand mats was exceptional, so I bought a few extra since I use the light grip blue mat the most often.  My order arrived very carefully packaged so there was no possibility of my new Mats getting bent in transit, and the order arrived very quickly.  Would definately recommend this Seller!",5
B079VWBFHF,"These adhesive mats are the perfect thing to use when cutting thick items like burlap, foam, fleece, stabilizers, etc. Circuit even advertises it will hold balsa wood.  The only problem is the mats get worn out quickly when cutting fabric such as fleece or stabilizer, and cleaning the stuff out of the grooves in the mats is hard on the hands -- hence the 4 stars for durability.  Nonetheless am thrilled to not have to cut these things by hand with a rotary cutter due to my arthritis -- so will definitely purchase again!",5
B079VWBFHF,I have been using this brand for a while and they seem to work well .  I can cut a lot of stencils on one sheet before they are too marked up to use.,4
B079VWBFHF,I love these mats. They try to charge 25 dollars good one mat in the store so Amazon really saved my tail on this!,5
B079VWBFHF,Worth the extra money for the branded mats to get the expected adhesion.,5
B079VWBFHF,I love how many prints I can get with the longer cutting board. The sticky part is really easy to clean and stays sticky like it should.,5
B079VWBFHF,I love these mats for material like glitter htv. It holds well,5
B079VWBFHF,"These are overall a great value for the quality and quantity!. Strong hold as it states. I mainly use it for craft foam, both 2mm and 1mm, and it holds it sooo well. I have also used this with Kraft cardstock, however it is a bit too strong of a grip for cardstock.  I was having trouble before with the foam sliding around, and these are exactly what I needed. I love the longer mats for the larger medias that I use.",5
B079VWBFHF,Nothing,5
B079VWBFHF,I love it strong grip on the paper and reusable,5
B079VWBFHF,"I've tried so many other mats, but none of them were as good.  There was just always something off with them.  Like being too sticky or not sticky enough.  These light mats are just right for my needs.  After all my experimentation I decided to just stick with the Cricut brand mats.  And these packs are a good deal.",5
B079VWBFHF,The grip is really good and is great for larger projects. My cricut Maker and the mats are really a great team!,5
B079VWBFHF,I needed some new mat so i cut one in half to get 2- 12x12 mats and let the balance as is lol. Great bang for your buck,5
B079VWBFHF,"Good grip, adhesion. Quality, and performance.",5
B079VWBFHF,Great deal for such a great product! And it is name brand!!! What a great value!!,5
B079VWBFHF,Product was just as described.  Fast shipping.  Will buy from this seller again.,5
B079VWBFHF,"Old sheets were worn, these are excellent and works as it should",5
B079VWBFHF,Bought these to hold transfer paper to run through et8550 for dtf printing. Helped to keep paper straight and no streaks.,5
B079VWBFHF,These work great for big projects. So glad I bought multi pack.,5
B079VWBFHF,Product is great but super happy it came packaged undamaged and straight! Was worried about shipping process and getting bent but not an issue!,5
B079VWBFHF,Nice price for a 3 pack. Is being used frequently and have been holding up well.,5
B079VWBFHF,"The length is great, adhesion is awesome and size as well for the price and brand. They are a good value for 3 mats.",5
B079VWBFHF,"I use them for felt mterials, its good but after a few uses it loses ashesion",5
B079VWBFHF,"These appear to be authentic Cricut standard grip mats. I used it for cutting vinyl & it worked just fine. They are sticky, but didn't seem to be as sticky as the last ones that I bought when new. Much cheaper than buying at the craft store. I had an old mat break & needed a quick replacement. Would buy again if I'm in need of a replacement mat quickly.",4
B079VWBFHF,"Just needed replacement mats.  Mine had been ""cleaned"" multiple times, to the point no tackiness remained.These new mats are great replacements.  A little expensive, but I know what I am paying for.",5
B079VWBFHF,Looked just fine. I didn't use them though. I returned them only because I didn't pay attention to the size. I'm new to cricut and mistakenly thought all mats were the same size. Silly me.,5
B079VWBFHF,"Brother has the worst mats that cost more than 3 of the Cricut.  I love my Scan N Cut for all it's features but its very easy to cut right through a mat the first time and the adhesion  is poor.  Makes me feel like they just want to make money on selling mats.  Found a YouTube video where they cut the center out of a used Brother mat and inserted the circuit mat.  Works like a charm!  You don't even need to cut the circuit mat.  Just cut on the inside of the ruler lines on the Brother, then place it over the Circuit mat and use good packing tape or E6000 to attach it.  Amazon sells the Circuit mats at a great price for THREE!",5
B079VWBFHF,Works as described!!,5
B079VWBFHF,I was shocked to find that my new mats (3 pak!) are too big for my Cricut Venture! WTF!I had to physically cut them down to size to use!,3
B079VWBFHF,these have lasted me a very long time. they have been washed multiple times and they are still great at holding the vinyls. order more so I can have them preloaded for orders,5
B079VWBFHF,"Love these mats!3 pack value is amazing for the price. Keep in mind the purple are NOT made for paper!!! You need to use a lighter grip mat for paper crafting!I use these to cut vinyl, plastic, and party foil and it works wonderful.I only wish the mats were square so we could rotate them to get use out of all 4 sides. I only use about 4"" at a time to the top and bottom of my mats wear out really quickly so if I could get use out of all 4 sides that would be so cool!But I know that's just a me thing so probably won't happen lolOverall great value. Research what mat is needed for your project before you buy!",5
B079VWBFHF,Already used them several times perfect,5
B079VWBFHF,"I've ordered this brand before and was very happy with them but this last order of the light grip mats was a total waste of money. First and only time I used them nothing stuck, wasn't able to cut anything. I was moving my craft room so by the time I realized they were junk it was too late to return. Will stick with the Cricut brand mats going forward.",2
B000W5R6UA,Work great for cleaning.,5
B000W5R6UA,I like the way they actually clean very well,5
B000W5R6UA,Cleans your piece and good length at a great value.,5
B000W5R6UA,Good product that works well in cleaning the small lines of the propane stove.,4
B000W5R6UA,They are a good quality pipe cleaner. Be careful they are kind of poky.,5
B000W5R6UA,I like the fact that they have coarse bristles- makes cleaning my pipe so much easier!,5
B000W5R6UA,"These are fine for cleaning a pipe, but most people will find the metal bristles are irritating.  I never had to wear gloves with a pipe cleaner until now.",3
B000W5R6UA,"These are good, work like they should. Arrived on time.",5
B000W5R6UA,Does an excellent job of keeping your pipe clean.,5
B000W5R6UA,If your pipe gets really resonate I highly recommend these they clean amazingly!,5
B000W5R6UA,You Me Super Fun Happy Number One Go Fast Now!,5
B000W5R6UA,"These are very aggressive and sturdy. They clean very well and it's as compact as any other pipe cleaner. Watch your fingers initially, they are for cleaning not fingers, pipes.",5
B000W5R6UA,These pipe are very efficient and easy to use. Great purchase,5
B000W5R6UA,"These are fantastic for cleaning pipes. They are really scratchy, so they are great for cleaning  pipes or one-shots but they would be a terrible choice for crafting. Compared to whatIs available at smoke shops they are crazy cheap.",5
B000W5R6UA,They designed to actually clean your pipe.,5
B000W5R6UA,good for cleaning my cob pipe,5
B000W5R6UA,Works as expected!,5
B000W5R6UA,Cleans pipes,5

B000W5R6UA,They'll do the job. Keep a bundle in pouch so when out and about.,5
B000W5R6UA,Has bristles to clean that pipe,5
B000W5R6UA,These are the best pipe cleaners ever!,5
B000W5R6UA,"Let me get this out of the way to start with: these are literal pipe cleaners. For cleaning pipes. Don't buy them for your baby to play with then give a one star review because you didn't pay attention to what you were buying.They're pretty much the same as other pipe cleaners I have had, except for the extra-stiff bristles mixed in among the fuzz. I don't know what some people are talking about, saying these spikey hairs are dangerous. I pinched the pipe cleaner as hard as I could and it didn't break the skin or even hurt much. It's like touching a brillo pad more than touching a rose stem. There's definitely a scratchiness but it's not harmful. Perhaps those who got cut encountered a staple in their packaging? Anyway these bristles help scrub and lift grime so your gross chore of cleaning tar out of a small hole goes by faster and with less effort. They are an excellent addition.I wouldn't mind a bit thicker, stiffer wire. You can't form one into a hook or corkscrew to scrub a hard to reach spot. Think twist tie more than paper clip. But that's not a flaw of the brand, that seems to be the norm. I've never seen the extra stiff type that I would like to try.I also wish the fuzz was a bit more thick, but again, these are no skinnier than any others I have found. The fuzz does suck both water and oil in very readily. Like any I have tried. I think a pipecleaner's a pipecleaner's a pipecleaner, really. These are nothing special, except for having a few bristles among the fuzz.Aside from wiping out my pipe I use them for sanitizing my hummingbird feeders. It is very important to keep those clean because hummingbirds can die if they get food poisoning. I scrub mine down twice a week with a paste of baking soda and nontoxic unscented dish soap, but recently I noticed a hint of grey inside the holes of the fake flowers, where the scrub brush and abrasive paste can't reach. I assume that's mold starting, or maybe beak grime? At any rate gotta get it clean! Enter these bad boys. Perfect fit, not too snug at all but fat enough that the fuzz cleans the hole with no effort at all. I doubt it needs it every time I wash the feeder but I think I'll use one of these about once a month and then I won't have to worry I am sickening any little birdie friends!",5
B000W5R6UA,"Bought these to use as a cleaning bristle for hard to reach places in the kitchen and bathroom - just what I needed!  Nice firm, sturdy bristles as opposed to regular pipe cleaners which quickly lose their cleaning strength.  Definitely recommend for this purpose!",5
B000W5R6UA,I like that you get a ton!,5
B000W5R6UA,"I used these to make costume crowns, and they worked extremely well for my use. I  would buy them again for my next project",4
B000W5R6UA,cleaning a pipe,4
B000W5R6UA,"They have these little, sharp bits of metal poking out throughout them. Seems like it'd just scratch whatever you're trying to clean, tbh. And it pokes your hand when you touch them, anywhere.The soft part in the middle is kind of pointless since nothing will reach it since the metal bits stick out more.And there's no inner packaging or anything. Kind of disappointed. Only really works well if you need scratchy pipe cleaners but I think it's ok for a vaporizer I'm using them ok.",3
B000W5R6UA,I use these for cleaning tubes and straws.  Also small areas of our cat fountains.  They poke my fingers a little but are effective at getting into tight areas.,5
B000W5R6UA,Firm bristles. Long enough for a pipe.,5
B000W5R6UA,Great pipe cleaners.  This is about our fifth order.,5
B000W5R6UA,Best cleaners I've used so far,5
B000W5R6UA,"Stiff, wire-like bristles as advertised. Excellent for cleaning out a pipe, would also work well for artists and arts and crafts hobbyists. Would purchase again.",4
B000W5R6UA,Works well. The only complaint is that it leaves pieces of fuzz behind.,4
B000W5R6UA,Great for cleaning rosin and has numerous uses around the garage. Recommend for those tough projects.,4
B000W5R6UA,"I really needed pipe cleaners for my pipes after I ran out, I just looked for the cheapest option with the best reviews/highest quantity, and I bought these without even fully reading the description. I was a bit surprised when I got them and they poked my fingers picking them up! Haha. They have little, strong plastic bristles sticking out of them--think like the plastic on clothes tags, but thicker. These *really* come in handy when scrubbing the stem and bowl. Also, the cotton itself seems to be thicker, which really helps in absorbing moisture, picking up the finer ash, and they seem to last longer than normal pipe cleaners. Like, with the average pipe cleaner, it seems like you only get a swipe or two from it before you need to grab a new one. With these, I can typically clean a whole pipe with just one, especially with the bristles. The wire seems to be a bit thicker as well, which helps with pushing the it through thinner parts like the shank and not bending like cheaper ones. I fold them in half to make a loop/bend to scrub out the more wider parts like the bowl and mortise/tenon.These will be a main stay in my pipe kits and cleaning paraphernalia from here out. NOTE: These are NOT for arts and crafts!",5
B000W5R6UA,Great product for an excellent price.  They always arrive quickly and do the job needed.  Thank you.,5
B000W5R6UA,Does a great job clearing out gunk out off resinous surfaces used this brand for years and have had consistently clear glss,5
B000W5R6UA,Work good,4
B000W5R6UA,These clean really well. But they have some very stiff bristles that feel like needles if you grab them a bit too hard.,4
B000W5R6UA,Good for what what I needed. Clean a cigarette holder steam. The other thing I purchased from Amazon. There is a review of it as well.,4
B000W5R6UA,The pipes the pipes are calling and so clean!,3
B000W5R6UA,"I haven't tried these with a pipe, but I imagine they would work very well.  I work with hot glass and frequently repurpose things when an appropriate tool is not avaiable or there is something which can do it better or more affordably (specialty glass tools are expensive). In fact, I even wrote a guide to outfitting a glass studio in Amazon's kitchen store 10-15 years ago (and ought to add these to it).The Zen pipe cleaners are about the same size/ diameter as other pipe cleaners.  Where they are different is small copper wires staggered around the pipe cleaner.  They are like tiny bristles which quickly and easily remove tough materials.  I am using them to remove baked on porcelain slip, essentially clay from the inside of beads.  Long beads with a small hole are the most difficult to clean because few needle files will fit inside the small diameter.  With most we can only use the tapered point, which does not reach far.  There are specialty drill bits but I am forever losing them, and I can not get them locally, or even on Amazon.  These pipe cleaners make fast work of a tedious chore.  They work well enough that I will be recommending them to other glass artists.I am guessing that fgew pipes are as difficult to clean, or have material as tough to remove as baked clay.  They ought to work very well in pipes too.The only downside is that they are a little rough to hold because of the copper bristles, but this will be more of an issue for people who potentially will use them for hours at a time.It is a very large package and a great deal on a good solid tool.",5
B000W5R6UA,Clean pipe,4
B000W5R6UA,These pipe cleaners are the best I have found,4
B000W5R6UA,"Cleans my pipes good, very durable",5
B000W5R6UA,Used a couple of times and it got the job done.,4
B000W5R6UA,"Just what I was expecting. Nothing more, nothing less.",4
B000W5R6UA,They do clean well. Just check for shedding and be careful of your fingers. But they do the job,4
B000W5R6UA,Surprising quantity considering reasonable price. Way better than Dill's.,5
B000W5R6UA,"Best price around for what I needed them for. Work great for its intended purpose. Lil sharp for extra cleaning, just what I needed!",5
B000W5R6UA,good deal as advertised,5
B000W5R6UA,I use for minor cleaning small stuff.  They work well.,5
B000W5R6UA,Works good,3
B000W5R6UA,"glad these are stiff enough to make it all the way into the hole, not like a previous waste of money on another that was too limp to shove into the whole. also there is a white build-up after use that contaminates the hole. can you please clean the shaft better for cleaner insertion and removal? thank you.",4
B000W5R6UA,"Great value, works well",5
B000W5R6UA,Best pipe cleaners I've used this year!,5
B000W5R6UA,"These are fantastic for cleaning in tiny spots and the prickly bristles help the cleaning. Be careful though, the prickly bristles are serious.",5
B000W5R6UA,"I smoke a churchwarden pipe so I wish they were a bit longer to get my entire pipe stem, but they clean and clean well, just use some isopropyl with them for the best result and all your pipe goop will be gone.",4
B000W5R6UA,These pipe cleaners actually can clean. Scratchy bits built in to clean out small places. I use for cleaning out my pet water bottle nozzle. Many uses. Definitely not for kids to use for crafts tho.,4
B000W5R6UA,Gets the job done every time.,5
B000W5R6UA,Use them on small gun cleaning Places were they can reach work great in hard to get aeras.,5
B000W5R6UA,I use this on my pipe all the time. gets clogged also use it on parts of my bong..great little scrapers,5
B000W5R6UA,"If you need a pipe cleaner for the original purpose, these are UNBEATABLE. Highly recommend.",5
B000W5R6UA,"These are awesome, exactly the kind of pipe cleaners that I needed. They're small, but not too small, essentially the perfect size for what I needed with my pipes. They're also not those dumb little arts and crafts pipe cleaners, these are very nice and sturdy with great bristles that really take care of the dirt and residue left behind. honestly I was impressed, I only needed to use like 4 of these when in the past I needed to use at least double to get the result I wanted. will definitely buy these again.",5
B000W5R6UA,These are heavy duty with tiny barbs in the weave. Brilliant design.,5
B000W5R6UA,I like the fact that these don't bend too easily and clean out your pipe with little fanfare.  The hard bristles work great and cleans out the whole stem.,5
B000W5R6UA,"This product makes it very easy to clear tobacco obstruction,  form my pipe. Easy clean up. What more can I say, would recommend this product, to any avid pipe smoker.",4
B000W5R6UA,"Stiffer than most, cleans well",5
B000W5R6UA,The product was exactly what I expected from the app.,5
B000W5R6UA,I use the pipe cleaners to clean my pipes.,5

B000W5R6UA,Product works well. Good price and shipped quickly,5
B000W5R6UA,Cleaning,4
B000W5R6UA,Nice,5
B000W5R6UA,this item w0rked well for cleaning small glass tubes,5
B000W5R6UA,"I use these for a multitude of things around the house.  There are small pieces of a scratchy substance like sand attached to the pipe cleaner.  They are glued down well, and it does not rub off or fall off even with heavy use.  These bend as easily as regular pipe cleaners, but you get extra cleaning power for sticky or gunky things that clog any type of tube.  It makes cleaning much faster.  Dip in a little rubbing alcohol before use and it speeds up the cleaning process.  These have become a staple in my house since I discovered them.",5
B000W5R6UA,"Perfect size, cleans well and keeps it shape.",5
B000W5R6UA,reasonable price compared to local stores,5
B000W5R6UA,These are far superior to the 'softer' pipe cleaners you will find elsewhere- the hard bristle does an excellent job of scrubbing the hard-to-reach areas; really breaks up the stubborn deposits that are always found in seriously-smoked pipes!,5
B000W5R6UA,These clean out pipes.,5
B000W5R6UA,"These are great for pipe cleaning, they are sturdy and they get the job done. There are some wiry bristles woven into the pipe cleaner that make these hard working little cleaners clean better than just a regular pipe cleaner. I highly recommend them for cleaning pipes.",5
B000W5R6UA,Liked!,5
B000W5R6UA,Not much to say about pipe cleaners...,5
B000W5R6UA,"It's not that I didn't like them, I don't need them now. I purchased a pipe that I am sending back. I also purchased pipe screens that I would like to return. None of it was opened.",3
B000W5R6UA,"The ZEN Bundles Zen Pipe Cleaners with Hard Bristle offer a convenient and effective solution for keeping your pipes clean and free from residue buildup. Designed with hard bristles for thorough cleaning, these pipe cleaners are perfect for maintaining your smoking accessories in pristine condition, ensuring optimal performance and flavor every time you indulge.",5
B000W5R6UA,I am using these to clean the inside of an old chandelier arm. They work well but I didn't realize how short they would be - or I didn't read the description enough.I am using them with beeswax polish to clean the inside of the pipe and they work well but shed lint.,4
B000W5R6UA,Love that they are so strong!  They have metal under the fuzzy coating.  I clean my hummingbird feeders with them and they work great!,5
B000W5R6UA,Received the correct items first time. Fast ship. Great price.,5
B000W5R6UA,These work just as well as the BJ Long and other bristle cleaners I have used on my briars.,4
B000W5R6UA,Work great. Ariced on time as advertised. Can't beat that.,4
B000W5R6UA,"While these are strong and do a good job of cleaning, I found them too sharp and painful to use and eventually threw them away. Wish someone would invent with handles. Have to buy them again and will wrap something around one end.",3
B07Y68P684,Completely satisfied!,5
B07Y68P684,On time delivery really good item works very well with the printer,5
B07Y68P684,I've never had a problem with this company.Works great at in my stencil printer and transfers onto the skin nicely.,4
B07Y68P684,Perfect size and condition,5
B07Y68P684,The carbon ink on the carbon paper smudged off so I was not able to use all the paper like I should have but I guess you get what you paid for,3
B07Y68P684,Transfers pretty well.,5
B07Y68P684,Perfect for tattoos,5
B07Y68P684,Great,5
B07Y68P684,Love the product  Highly recommended,5

B07Y68P684,"I'm very happy with my purchase, great stenciling paper and all. I Highly Recommend",5
B07Y68P684,What there to say very prompt delivery product is what u see and works,5
B07Y68P684,Good amount for the price and comes with thermal print directions.,5
B07Y68P684,They work great! They come exactly as described.,5
B07Y68P684,These have been a life saver! Thank you,5
B07Y68P684,It's transfer paper. Works great for tattoos.,5
B07Y68P684,"I don't have a thermal imager, but these sheets work brilliantly with a ball point pen.",5
B07Y68P684,I got this paper for my husband and it works well with his tattoo stencil printer. I will purchase again.,5
B07Y68P684,Works great,5
B07Y68P684,This tattoo paper is amazing! The designs transfer onto the skin so clearly and easily. It's super easy to work with and the paper feels high quality.  I've had great results with both stick-and-poke and practice skin. Definitely recommend giving this stuff a try.,5
B07Y68P684,i love this this you guys you guys i just love this,5
B07Y68P684,"Had to trim every sheet a 1/4 inch just to get it to fit into my thermal printer. Very annoying, but the paper itself held up and the stencils came out crisp.Will be trying other brands.",3
B07Y68P684,Product is PERFECT for what it's supposed to do but the only flaw is a few sheets didn't pick up the transfer no matter how hard or light you pressed. Even after a few passes it seemed as though it wouldn't adhere for the stencil.,4
B07Y68P684,Defiantly buying more again.,5
B07Y68P684,No issues works just fine,5
B07Y68P684,Works great through a printer or as a hand stencil on tattoo designs. Stays put if applied properly but will still wipe off when done.,5
B07Y68P684,Look great,5
B07Y68P684,Works great,5
B07Y68P684,Dope,5
B07Y68P684,Everything came as it said. It just didn't transfer from paper to skin very well even with skin cleaned.,3
B07Y68P684,"Tattoo transfer paper is a game-changer for both professional tattoo artists and enthusiasts. Its precision and ease of use ensure that designs are accurately and clearly transferred onto the skin, providing a reliable template for inking. The quality of the paper ensures that even intricate details are captured, reducing the risk of errors during the tattooing process. Additionally, it adheres well without smudging, allowing for a seamless and clean application. This tool significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of tattoo creation, making it an indispensable asset in any tattoo studio. Highly recommended for anyone serious about their tattoo artistry.",5
B07Y68P684,,5
B07Y68P684,This product works well for tattoo transfers.,4
B07Y68P684,"I bought these a while ago to practice placing stencils and working on my linework. I was pleased to find that, although they are supposed to be used with a thermal printer, I was able to draw directly on them and they transferred just fine. I would recommend these for beginners because they are easy to use and the results are good.",5
B07Y68P684,Enjoyed it,5
B07Y68P684,Serves its purpose.,5
B07Y68P684,Great for practicing and fake skins,4
B07Y68P684,"Make sure you use a compatible transfer medium (or a new speed stick deodorant), but this works well and transfers designs to the skin nicely. You can get several transfers out of each one if you need to redo the placement. Of course, you need to be careful when applying it; it will smear easily during application if you move the paper once it's on the skin.I have only drawn designs by hand, not tested with a thermal printer.",5
B07Y68P684,"I liked this product. It worked perfectly as a stencil, I just wish it transferred the ink from the pages better.",4
B07Y68P684,Nice,4
B07Y68P684,Good quality great product easy to use love having them will definitely order more,5
B07Y68P684,Perfect,5
B07Y68P684,works as should and transfers perfectly and nice amount will definitely purchase again,5
B07Y68P684,Exactly what I needed and packaged nicely.,5
B07Y68P684,"Easy to use, would work better with a thermal printer, but also works with pencil freehand. You must use Stencil gel to get it to lay down, but seems solid overall",5
B07Y68P684,It works good for the price.,4
B07Y68P684,A good amount come for the price. If you know what you are buying they are just what you are looking for obviously. Perfect buy for stocking your shop. Good buy for apprentices practicing too.,5
B07Y68P684,Thank you so much great price for the amount .,5
B07Y68P684,Good enough for starters,4
B07Y68P684,Good transfer paper that can be bought in bulk.,5
B07Y68P684,Its is exactly what you expect it really easy and simple to use there are some tutorials online if you need help its pretty cool,5
B07Y68P684,I like that these are the same size as printer paper. It makes it easy to print something and then I can trace it.,4
B07Y68P684,Tatto sencils these work great,5
B07Y68P684,"Every brand of this is messy and you must be careful, clean and precise.  I did not find anything inferior in this brand.  It worked well for me.  I read a review that said it couldnt handle fine lines, but I had no problem getting them drawn (with a fine tip ball point) and they transferred cleanly and very thin.I used Speed Stick before transfer and then waited 15 minutes after transfer before starting to tattoo.  I felt it stayed on well.  I used witch hazel to clean off excess ink, and the design did not fade or wipe off too much.  I was able to work the area until finished and then remove what was left with rubbing alcohol, which cleans it up fast.",5
B07Y68P684,"I was very skeptical at first when i opened the paper and it was EXTREMELY flimsy and it took me 10 mins to get it into my stencil machine. but when it came out i was very happy with the results, came out perfect, almost a dupe of the spirit brand other than the fact the paper is very very fragile.",4
B07Y68P684,Great product for tattooing or art work.,5
B07Y68P684,There is nothing more to say about this other than you get your money's worth,5
B07Y68P684,"Just so everyone that reads reviews knows this ... This is not for hand tracing , this stuff is only for termafax machines !! Its decent stuff but if your gonna trace by hand you need Spirit transfer paper .. I see many people complain and the simple fact is THIS IS TERMAFAX transfer paper only !!!!!!!! They need to change the description !!!!",4
B07Y68P684,I use this to make my tatoo stencils and they work great. I will be purchasing more. The price is great and the quality is excellent. Thank you,5
B07Y68P684,Transfers easily and dosent smear once the transfer is applied.,5
B07Y68P684,"Super clean and great quality, stencil last thru a lot of wiping",5
B07Y68P684,Great quality. Works great just to free hand on or stencil printer.,5
B07Y68P684,Recommend,5
B07Y68P684,Great for tracing only complaint is that the inner paper where the ink transfers moves! Good for practice but not for actual compiling for a unique piece,2
B07Y68P684,The price  it sosw what u need it to,5
B07Y68P684,Transfer paper is very good for beginners,5
B07Y68P684,I was looking for a product that was cost affective for when i am practicing on my fake skin for tattoos. I love this product because it adheres well to the skin (real and fake) very well. It stays on the skin for a good amount of time. The packaging was great and the instructions very easy to read.,5
B07Y68P684,Loving it,5
B07Y68P684,Its easy for beginners,5
B07Y68P684,"Love this product! No complaints as of now, will be getting more shortly",5
B07Y68P684,"Good for hand stencil , not good for printing stencils",2
B07Y68P684,"New artist, old artist professional in a shop or joe smo. This is the key to any work to be done on a client. Clean stencil work like you get from these will make a person's hand twitch or shake seem almost non existent. Artists that still draw out the work they are doing know the struggles as we age. Next transfers never do I worry if it's going to transfer to the skin or  cheaper transfer paper I've used no matter what I did the patterns wouldn't fully take. Not an issue and if you don't place it correctly first go. Repeat transfer process at least one more time before the stencil isn't usable again.",5
B0879YNTTP,"Very easy to use. Arrived very fast. Great value for the money. Would highly recommend this product, and would buy from this seller again.",5
B0879YNTTP,"Works great, great quality",5
B0879YNTTP,Excellent 3 hole punch.  Works very well and nice looking.  I am very please with this purchase. Thank you.,5
B0879YNTTP,I like that the product is very sturdy so it should last a long time. It has a reservoir to catch the paper from the holes punched.,5
B0879YNTTP,Works well like most Amazon Basics stuff.  Can punch about eight pages at a time.,5
B0879YNTTP,"Does what it is suppose to do. Only thing, like all other hole punchers, is that you can't do more than like 10 pieces of paper. I use this to organize my notes from school into a binder and this is great for that.",5
B0879YNTTP,Works great and does what I need it to,5
B0879YNTTP,This 3 hole punch is better than expected. It snaps through more than10 pages with minimum force. I would definitely recommend and buy again if needed,5
B0879YNTTP,As advertised.  Decent weight to not fall all over when in use.,5
B0879YNTTP,nice,5
B0879YNTTP,Sturdy and great for my day to day teacher tasks.,5
B0879YNTTP,Works as intended good price,5
B0879YNTTP,Excellent product!,5
B0879YNTTP,"Product is very good quality and easy for a small 12 yr old to handle. He is now being homeschooled and will have a lot of projects to do. This will last him through out his many years of projects. It is easy for him to operate and is light weight, stores well with all his Homes school supplies.",5
B0879YNTTP,This 3 hole punch is very good at punching holes in my paper so I can put them in my binder,5
B0879YNTTP,Very sturdy!,5
B0879YNTTP,Not much to say about a paper punch.  It works well & replaces one that was so old I don't know when we got it.,5
B0879YNTTP,"Somehow the hole punches in my house both stopped working correctly.  I quickly ordered this one and am totally relieved and happy to have my go-to, quick and perfect hole-punch to the rescue.",5
B0879YNTTP,"This 3-hold punch works smoothly.  It's a ""basic"" but just as good as any more expensive 3-hole punch. Sleek looking and exactly what I need.",5
B0879YNTTP,Good value for money,5
B0879YNTTP,Very Good. I like it a lot,4
B0879YNTTP,Well made and punches clean holes. Great for the price.,5
B0879YNTTP,Value,5
B0879YNTTP,I tried it right away and it works perfectly ! The price is good too !,5
B0879YNTTP,"Good price and quality, easy to use great value",5
B0879YNTTP,Well made..It makes holes in paper..lol,4
B0879YNTTP,"The 3 holes shaft was not aligned correctly to the holes, making them very difficult when pushing downward. I tried to adjust the shafts but still not working properly that I have to call AMAZON and get a replacement.",3
B0879YNTTP,works as intended,5
B0879YNTTP,"This hole punch does exactly what you expect it too. It is not adjustable so plan to only hole punch your standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper. Its also not built for more than maybe 5 sheets of paper at a time. If you need to do more, I would recommend getting a stronger one.If you are just looking to use it around the house for minor filing and homework, then this hole punch will do the trick just fine.",5
B0879YNTTP,"It punches holes, not much more to say. No more then I'll use it  it should last me a long time",4
B0879YNTTP,"My old hole punch was really old and pretty dull, nice to have a sharp new one",5
B0879YNTTP,As described,5
B0879YNTTP,"High quality, works as expected",5
B0879YNTTP,The three hole punch does not work like it should.,3
B0879YNTTP,Just what I was looking for.,5
B0879YNTTP,High quality,5
B0879YNTTP,"This 3 hole punch was exactly what I needed when setting up my new office.  Great quality and great product.  I would recommend this 3 hole punch for anyone needing one for an office, school or any other project need.",5
B0879YNTTP,"If you don't need a hole punch for larger documents, this one is great. It is your basic hole punch that can 3 hole punch a small group of papers.",4
B0879YNTTP,good quality works great,5
B0879YNTTP,"Very easy to use, works great. It meets my every expectation.",5
B0879YNTTP,Sturdy item. Works great for punching holes in documents for a three ring binder. Would Ryder again,5
B0879YNTTP,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            For what I need it for, it works just fine. If you need to use it for large quantities at once, not the right fit.",5
B0879YNTTP,Worked real well and got the job done,5
B0879YNTTP,"That's what I am. I have just been 3 hole punching the crap out of everything. Oh man, I can't believe how great this is for punching 3 holes at once.",5
B0879YNTTP,Good,5
B0879YNTTP,"Convenient size, easy to use, versatile for variety of different paper thickness, adjustable. Professional looking and great stability. Lasts and lasts",5
B0879YNTTP,good,5
B0879YNTTP,"Ok,but not that heavy duty.",4
B0879YNTTP,Good product for a reasonable price.,5
B0879YNTTP,"The item appears to be in good shape and well constructed.  The hole puncher, however, has no guides to align the paper.  I assumed that any hole punch would have a guide so that you're not putting holes in different spots on the paper.  To be fair, the description didn't mention that it had guides, but I feel as though that should be a standard feature on any three-hole puncher.",3
B0879YNTTP,helps to keep important papers in order and maintained,5
B0879YNTTP,Just wish there was a paper guide to know where to put paper instead of guessing and have various sets of papers with the holes in different areas.,3
B0879YNTTP,Good quality 3 hole punch for any home or work office,5
B0879YNTTP,Can punch several papers at the same time. Perfect for my choir music and for anyone who wants to securely save printed material. The punch is easy to use and holds the punches inside to be emptied later.,5
B0879YNTTP,It lacks a guide for the edge of the paper.  This means all your papers will be punched differently and the  edge of stack of paper will all be misaligned.  It will drive a perfectionist crazy. I would pay a little more to get one with a guide.,2
B0879YNTTP,"Excellent 3 hole punch. Note the amount of sheets it can punch through. If you don't need to punch more than it is rated, this is the best deal out there. Mostly I only need it or 1 or 2 sheets.",5
B0879YNTTP,This is a good quality paper punch. Inexpensive and does the job. Would recommend and I would personally purchase again.,5
B0879YNTTP,It's a 3 hole punch. That's about it.,5
B0879YNTTP,Works just as it should and I do a lot of printing that needs to be in notebooks.,5
B0879YNTTP,Just as described.,5
B0879YNTTP,"I need only a few sheets hole-punched at a time.  I was thrilled right out of the box.  GREAT for light, home-office use. Would absolutely recommend to others w/similar needs.",5
B0879YNTTP,Only tried with 8 sheets of basic printer paper but still performed excellently. Clean and snappy punches. Use on a hard counter to avoid damaging the surface.,5
B0879YNTTP,This does as was required and I was able to crank 18ppgs at a time before problems emerged (much higher than the recommended amount). I would buy this again.,5
B0879YNTTP,"Amazon Basics 3 Hole Punch, 10 Sheet Capacity, Black. So far so good. Nice and sturdy  with good spring action. No jamming so far. And does not require a whole lot of muscle.",5
B0879YNTTP,This hole puncher is great! Easy to use,4
B0879YNTTP,Works great for all my binder hole punching needs. Comes with plastic pieces that need to be removed from hinges to keep it from breaking in shipping. I love it.,5
B0879YNTTP,It very sturdy and it does the job as it should,5
B0879YNTTP,What I was hoping when I ordered it. Just like the hole punch I had 30 years ago. Exactly what I needed.,5
B0879YNTTP,Good product,5
B0879YNTTP,This hole punch is slender and lightweight. Easy punch 10 pages at a time without hurting my wrist.,5
B0879YNTTP,"This punch looked small compared to others that I have used over the years when I  first opened it, but it works very well and takes up much less room in the drawer! Smooth action too even when punching multiple sheets.",4
B0879YNTTP,"I can only punch 9 holes at a time, not 10.  But that might be because I'm finally old!",5
B0879YNTTP,cheap and easy to use works great,4
B0879YNTTP,"Considering the price, it's a good value. It is sharp, but it's not adjustable.",5
B0879YNTTP,"Easy to use. Good quality very adjustable, punches multiple sheets with ease",5
B0879YNTTP,I wish it were sharper.  But I'm happy.,4
B0879YNTTP,"Its just the standard hole punch, but really depending on the paper I don't think 10 pieces will punch even with some muscle. I think I paid 8$ and I just have it for my home. So its great for what I need it for.",5
B0879YNTTP,I bought the hole punch y o put holes in recipes I had printed from Ema to put into 3 ring binder. It was easy to use and allowed me to put my recipes away neatly,5
B0879YNTTP,Works great,5
B0879YNTTP,"So far, I have not encountered any difficulties in making whole punches in my home office needs.",5
B0879YNTTP,Tricky lock to open before using but it is a great product at a great price,5
B0879YNTTP,De buen material y resistente,5
B0879YNTTP,Need to keep track of my paperwork and file. Works well good value for the money,5
B015W8DWUO,"I have been buying these candle wicks for over three years and never disappoint! The wick stay, white color, the length is perfect for 4 - 5 inch tall candle. They are pre wax and non sticky. Overall good quality.",5
B015W8DWUO,Great wicks for the price. They burn clean,5
B015W8DWUO,Extend the life of your candles by using these effective wicks. So glad!,5
B015W8DWUO,So far I've been happy with these wicks I bought to use for candle making at home. They're easy to stand up and seem to burn at a reasonable rate.,4
B015W8DWUO,"Worked for the project I am doing. Was at my doorstep the next day. The wax coating does melt and the wick becomes less rigid until it cools, so make sure you have something that holds the wick straight as you are creating your candles during the hot wax stage.",5
B015W8DWUO,"I make my own candles and have never been let down by these wicks. They burn very clean and are easy to put into melted wax. They are also a great value for the amount that you get.I use dowels across the top of my candles or sometimes, the metal grid insert out of an onion chopper, to keep the wicks straight while the wax cools and then trim the excess.",5
B015W8DWUO,Works just like it should!,5
B015W8DWUO,I neglected to purchase one of those sticks that holds the wick upright when you let the wax cool and for a while there had to perfectly position 3/4 pencils and pens around the rim to have it stay put.,5
B015W8DWUO,"Pleasantly surprised that these work greatI do have to tape the wick to the bottom though,",4
B015W8DWUO,I have not used them yet but they seem ok,4
B015W8DWUO,I like this product,4
B015W8DWUO,Excellent for diy candle projects,4
B015W8DWUO,"I purchased the EricX Light 100 Piece Cotton Candle Wicks for a DIY candle making project, and had such high hopes. While they were pre-waxed and easy to use, I found that they did not burn evenly. Some of the wicks burned faster than others, resulting in an uneven burn pattern in my candles. Additionally, I noticed that the quality of the wicks was not consistent. Overall, these wicks were decent for the price, but I was disappointed in the lack of consistency and quality.",3
B015W8DWUO,"Be aware these wicks get super smoky. I wouldn't recommend them. We had to open a window because this tiny candle was legitimately making the whole house hazy and smokey, and set off the smoke alarm. Every candle I try to make with these does this, regardless of the type of wax.",3
B015W8DWUO,Excellent wicks!,5
B015W8DWUO,Looks good,3
B015W8DWUO,"We have these citronella candles to keep the mosquitoes away. One of them had such a short wick that it would burn out with gentle winds. So, I made a small hole next to the existing wick with a stick, and inserted half of one of these wicks. It works great!",5
B015W8DWUO,"Loved the price, easy item to use for someone just exploring candles making process",4
B015W8DWUO,"I got a pack of these for my first foray into candlemaking. So far, I've used it with American Soy Organics Millennium Wax (also purchased on Amazon), and an old 12oz mason jar I had lying around the house.For the pour, I had no issues getting the wick to adhere to the jar - I ended up dipping the tab in the melted wax and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes before pouring and it stayed put just fine. Others have commented on the tabs being at an angle relative to the wicks which is true, but in my experience it straightened out nicely and I just used a pen across the top of the jar to keep it straight while it cured. I cut it to ~1/4"", and after a few hours of burning it's stayed clean with no mushrooming or other issues. My test candle used just the wax and some essential oils, and I'll update if there are issues once I use actual fragrances and dyes.The only issue (and why I dinged it a star) is that it's probably a bit undersized for the jar size, and there is a bit of tunneling going on. I'm pretty confident it will work fine with a smaller vessel, but if you're using a mason jar or bigger you'll want to look for a larger wick.",4
B015W8DWUO,"I'm going to order more because they worked great. I do use hot glue guns to tack them in thought because sometimes you'll get a floater due to the heat of the wax, but the mix work perfectly.",5
B015W8DWUO,Will use to make candles in future!,5
B015W8DWUO,"I bought these because I saw a lady on TikTok. Melt the wax out of her old candles (in layers, let layers cool off before adding new wax) and create new ones by adding new wicks. Hope this helps. Just saving some coins.",5
B015W8DWUO,Exactly what I expected for candle making.,5
B015W8DWUO,"I recently used the EricX Light Cotton Candle Wicks for my candle-making projects and am very pleased with the results. These 6"" pre-waxed wicks are easy to work with and provide a consistent, steady burn. They are perfect for DIY candle making and ensure a clean, even flame. The pack of 100 wicks is great value for money, making it ideal for large projects or frequent use. Highly recommend for anyone into candle making!",5
B015W8DWUO,For candles,5
B015W8DWUO,Thick wicks. Works well for candle making.,4
B015W8DWUO,"I ordered these to wick new candles made from the remnants of old ones.I should have bought wire core wicks but, I didn't. No big deal, I hold the vertical by passing the wick top thru a coffee stirrer with a hole in it. Then rest the stirrer over the candle container.",5
B015W8DWUO,it is a great value pack of wicks. They are not adhesive on the bottom so keeping them straight can be a bit tough. overall I was satisfied and happy with them.,4
B015W8DWUO,good,5
B015W8DWUO,"I used these when I was making 3 wick candles and they worked wonderfully. Just got the wick stickers and attached them to the bottom of the metal anchor and when we pured in the wax, these did their job beautifully! Not one came off despite using about 50 wicks we placed in one day. Very pleased with this product and their integrity while burning them after the candles were complete. Good burn rate and wonderful wick!",5
B015W8DWUO,making candles with borrowed molds.  the wax seemed very clean and pure.,4
B015W8DWUO,Like the quality but smaller diameter than expected.  But thats on me. I must have missed it in description.,4
B015W8DWUO,These wicks work very well in 464 soy wax,5
B015W8DWUO,"Good to use for candle making, my first candle and I love it.",5
B015W8DWUO,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These are nice 6in wicks. They come packaged well. I can't wait to use them in my candles.,5
B015W8DWUO,"As stated, the wicks are pre-waxed and 100% cotton. They have a consistent, slow burn and don't emit a lot of smoke. Whenever I make candles I either use these or hemp, depending on the type of candle I'm using, but I've found that the cotton wicks burn faster than the hemp ones. Something to note, which I didn't really see until I had these in my hand, is that the metal base of these wicks is small, about the size of a dime or so. Other bases are usually the size of a nickel. Depending on if you're using stickers to adhere the base to the bottom of the jar, it might play a factor into your decision. If you're using a hot glue gun or similar method, it won't make a difference. My personal preference would be to go with Hemp over Cotton, if only because it burns slower, but there's also nothing wrong with these wicks as they burn nicely and evenly with the candle (at least with the 464 soy wax I use). The amount that you get for the price is good, too. You'll most likely be trimming the wicks by more than 50% as well unless you have a really tall jar you're making, so don't worry about the wick itself not being tall enough.",4
B015W8DWUO,"I recently purchased this set for my candle making hobby and I'm extremely happy with my purchase. The wicks are pre-waxed and 6 inches long which makes it easy to use for various candle sizes. The cotton wicks burn cleanly and evenly, allowing my candles to have a consistent flame and long burn time. I also appreciate the fact that these wicks are lead-free and eco-friendly, making them safe and sustainable for both me and the environment.The packaging of the wicks is also very convenient, as they come in a sealed bag to prevent any damage or tangling during shipping. I found the wicks easy to work with and they had no issues adhering to the wax. The fact that this set comes with 100 pieces is also a great value for the price, allowing me to make multiple candles with just one purchase.",5
B015W8DWUO,I'm a Scentsy wax warmer gal - but I purchased these to make candles with the wax once the scent is gone. They work perfect for that! I just purchased some paper coffee cups and put this wick in the bottom and pour the used wax into the cup to make a candle. I guess I'll use them if the power goes out and we need candles.,5
B015W8DWUO,Good,5
B015W8DWUO,"I wish I could use these wicks but they are just wasting all my wax and essential oils, and a lot of my money. These are too small for a very standard 7 oz jar candle. As you can see from the photos they dont fully melt all the wax or get enough of a melt pool to throw a scent. Some also appear to be much bigger than others. If you use 2 wicks, its way too much, as is the only next size up from this company, which will leave an inch melt pool. 1/4-1/2 inch melt pool with the sides fully melted is ideal. Its impossible to find the right size with this company. These are also the best wicks I could find on Amazon too. I guess Ill have to go somewhere else before I waste anymore money. Its very frustrating that Ive bought 4 sizes on Amazon and still havent found the right sized wick to match the most common candle jars they are selling, hundreds of dollars later. It doesnt help that this company states nowhere what size candles their wicks actually work on.",3
B015W8DWUO,"This product is exactly what the description states and of good quality. Also, the quantity of the product is great for the price.",4
B015W8DWUO,Good product,5
B015W8DWUO,Used for insect candles at the lake when the original wicks get too short,5
B015W8DWUO,I mentioned I was interested in pouring some of my own candles and my hubby surprised me with these wicks! They do the trick!,5
B015W8DWUO,Burns too fast and will burn a hole down the candle without burning it evenly.  Then the wax from the sides melts and smothers the wick so it doesn't burn at all.,2
B015W8DWUO,"Burns just like a normal, not too fast at all. Doesn't make any noise for the many different waxes I've used and comes with so many! Great product for the price.",5
B015W8DWUO,Nice wicks.,4
B015W8DWUO,"These are the perfect length for 3 wick candles ( a three wick candle you buy from Bath and Body Works). I purchased these to consolidate half burned candles into one candle jar.  I enjoy the same three flavors so I had a lot of them sitting around. I used a wax warmer to heat up the half empy jars then poured them into a clean jar...Great money saver on that front and for the amount you get it's almost worth the hassle. That being said, these wicks have their flaws.1:  wicks are bent at the metal tip making it hard to stand up in the jar.  Tried dipping the metal tab into hot wax to make a sticky adhesion but it did not work. Finally had to break out the hot glue gun to stick the metal to the bottom of the jars. I would have preferred if the Wicks were a little longer so I could tie them to something while I poured the hot wax.  I had to use chopsticks to line up the wicks and keep them up right after I poured in the wax...then babysit them while they cooled off.  #2:  they are not thick enough. I noticed after I had a candle prepared I instantly wished I had made a 4 Wick candle as it burned uneven and eventually burned out.  When comparing the store-bought candle wicks to these... this brand had a much skinnier Wick even though they are pre dipped.  It is almost as if it's only meant for tiny candles.  I trimmed the wick to what was suggested online so I know I did not cut it too short.  Overall they were functional after some trial and error and I think if I was making small candles they might have been easier to use.",3
B015W8DWUO,"I purchased these candle wicks with high hopes, but I am thoroughly disappointed with their performance. The product description claimed that these wicks were suitable for any candle size, yet they failed to even fully melt a 2.5-inch candle.the wick just couldn't keep up. The frustration of having a partially burned candle is beyond disappointing. I was expecting a relaxing, beautifully lit ambiance, but instead, I got an uneven, disappointing burn.I cannot recommend these candle wicks to anyone seeking a quality candle experience. The misleading product description and ineffective performance left me with a sense of regret for my purchase. Save your time and money and look for better alternatives that actually deliver on their promises.",5
B015W8DWUO,"They're ok, not great. Very small width. Best for soy or par blends. Not great for beeswax. Only for very small candles like votive or taper. Not gonna work if your intended candles are wider than 1.25"" or you'll have a lot of wasted fuel. Perfect for a low temp, soft wax votive.",4
B015W8DWUO,I made candles for my home using this product,5
B015W8DWUO,These are great for making candles I also use them on my old candles when the wick burns down,5
B015W8DWUO,Do you have ten thousand candles that you can't burn but you are to stubborn to throw the last little bit away?!?Well you need this product.Call me Victor because I brought Frankenstein back.,4
B015W8DWUO,I have been buying these wicks for a year now for my candle making. ( which is how long I have been making and selling them). I was attracted initially that Ericx light is a small business and also that there is not lead in their wicks. I have been so happy with with how my candles burn with them. They are easy to use and great price too. I am a customer for life.,5
B015W8DWUO,"I had a candle I got with 3 wicks and those wicks were barely burning.  I ended up melting the wax and pulling the old wicks out and put 3 of these back in place of them, and now my candle is going burning like a champ!",5
B015W8DWUO,"I had a few similar smelling candles that would no longer burn but had a decent amount of wax left. I melted them all down into one candle and used three of these wicks. As seen, they work perfectly! I used three since that was how many were originally in this jar and it had good coverage.",5
B015W8DWUO,"I burn candles day and night. Sometimes a candle malfunctions and you end up with a mass of wax. As thrifty as I am, I scrape up that wax for future use. So, I picked up these wicks to fashion candles out of my saved-up candle wax. I've only made one so far, but the wick was solid in its base, already well-saturated, and ready to work. I just positioned it in its glass, layered in candle wax shavings, pressed down to get something approaching a solid, and lit it. Brilliant! I definitely recommend for the DIYer. And inexpensive, too.",5
B015W8DWUO,"These candle wicks were just what I was looking for, and the price was unbeatable! Although I didn't initially use adhesives to secure them to the bottom of the candle jar, I plan to invest in some soon to ensure long-term use of this excellent product. Thank you!",5
B015W8DWUO,"I just recently started making candles and it's been a lot of fun.  Lots of ups and downs in this learning process, but these wicks have been great with every candle.  I'm using 8oz straight sided jars and they are perfect.  Some of the negative reviews I believe are due to not researching enough. As for not standing straight while pouring the wax,  that's why they make wick centering devices that hold the wick still and keep them centered while you pour. (Shown in pic) I also glue mine to the bottom,  or they make wick sticker things to hold them down.  The soot problems people seem to have could be wrong wick size with wrong size jar etc... So many things could be causing that having nothing to do with the quality of these wicks. If I've learned anything in this process is that candle making is an art, and getting things right takes a lot of testing with a lot of different variables.  I am using soy wax gb444 with the 8oz jars and for me,  these wicks have been great.  Slow steady burn.",5
B015W8DWUO,"work fine, ..no scent (unscented)  plenty long",4
B015W8DWUO,They are good. I wish I bought the sticky pieces to keep them on the bottom of the glass.,5
B015W8DWUO,"I have used many wicks from many companies and so I was a little apprehensive to try a wick from Amazon instead of a candle supply. I decided to take a chance on these though because I love that they are 100% cotton and I can insure my customers a clean burn.I was NOT disappointed. I use these double wicked in a 3.25"" diameter straight side glass jar with a soy/paraffin blend wax and a 8-10% fragrance load. I get a great hot throw and an even melting pool.Like another reviewers said below, Candle making is not just throwing a wick and wax in to a jar and expecting a great candle. You have to use trial and error, the correct pouring temperature, the correct wick for your size of vessel and much much more. You will have issues if these things are not perfect and that is what I see below in some of the reviews. You MUST create a test candle EVERY SINGLE TIME before you make an entire batch of candles, and test burn!I will be buying these again for my 16oz candles! :)",5
B015W8DWUO,"I like them, but I had a hard time keeping the wicked in the middle. I will try something else next time when I make candles.",5
B015W8DWUO,They burn well.,5
B015W8DWUO,the perfect length for mason jars & burn slow,5
B015W8DWUO,good wicks... wish they were longer...,5
B015W8DWUO,"First time user of these wicks , work great and super easy to use , nice wax coating very even .",5
B015W8DWUO,"This was a good value, comes in a bag and my complaint about that is they have bent the bases at angle to the wicks in order to get them in the bag flat wise and they don't want to straighten out. I gently try to bend them back and insert them.  If you secure your wick at the top of the jar to be straight up/down the bases are still not laying flat against the bottom.  Otherwise they are fine, light and burn steady.",4
B015W8DWUO,"Work very good, slightly harder to use the bent or broken ones but still nice.",4
B015W8DWUO,Wicks too long for my need,3
B015W8DWUO,Nice wicks. Good quality for the price,5
B015W8DWUO,These wicks are terrible. My candles do not stay lit with these wicks. They have a bad smell when burning and a decent amount of black smoke is produced. Not impressed. Super flimsy as well and do not hold up well when making a candle,3
B015W8DWUO,No issues.  Serves their purpose well,5
B015W8DWUO,I followed directions carefully and did everything it said to do but the wicks would not stay in place once hot wax was poured,3
B015W8DWUO,Burns slow and long.  Makes it easy to recycle old candles.,5
B015W8DWUO,"These are nothing fancy, but they worked exactly as they should. I haven't noticed much debris from the wick being left in the wax which is nice. My only issue is that the wax around each wick is a little thick and cracked rather than bent which made it a little more difficult to wrap the wick around a skewer to hold it in place. Not impossible, just unexpected so I was a little more careful. This did not impact the way the candle burns, nor did it prevent me from securing the wicks in place prior to poring the wax. The slight thickness of the outer wax is the only reason these didn't get five stars.See below for my process:To make the process of keeping them in place a little easier, I lit an older candle I had around the house and dipped the metal in the pooled wax before placing this in the center of my containers. I then twisted the top of each wick around a skewer to hold them in place. I had no shifting during the poring process using this method.",4
B015W8DWUO,"The packaging of the wicks is also very convenient, as they come in a sealed bag to prevent any damage or tangling during shipping. I found the wicks easy to work with and they had no issues adhering to the wax. The fact that this set comes with 100 pieces is also a great value for the price, allowing me to make multiple candles with just one purchase.",5
B015W8DWUO,These are good wicks stable easy to set slow burn,5
B015W8DWUO,These wicks burn very nicely. The length is nice for various sizes of candles. Just cut them down.,5
B015W8DWUO,Mostly stayed together with use,4
B015W8DWUO,Melted down some left over wax from another candle and bought these to make more candles. Works great!,5
B015W8DWUO,It stays there n place while pouring in the candle wax. But the guider is still needed to keep the wick in place,4
B015W8DWUO,"These are great.  For the price of one new candle, I was able to turn all my scraps of wax into several new ones and the rest of the packet will last me a lifetime.",5
B015W8DWUO,I like these wicks and they work well for candles,5
B015W8DWUO,Received item yesterday. It is for a birthday gift for my grandson who turning 18 in March and wanted to start a hobby of making candles. Looks to be in good shape and every thing in box.,5
B015W8DWUO,The right length and was exactly what i needed. Nice wick. Plenty left over for more candle making,5
B015W8DWUO,Came well packaged.,5
B015W8DWUO,"I was tired of all my candle wicks burning out, but still having so much wax leftover. I decided to buy these wicks and melt down the remaining wax so I could continue to burn the candles. These have worked perfectly and I feel better not wasting my favorite scented candles!",5
B06W2NBCW5,"Gorilla mini hot glue sticks are a must-have for any crafter or DIY enthusiast! They melt quickly and bond incredibly strong, making them perfect for all kinds of projects. I love that they work well with my mini glue gun and provide a clean, smooth finish.  No more cheap hot glue in this house.  Gorilla Glue is our go to.",5
B06W2NBCW5,DurableValue for moneyGlue quality is good.,5
B06W2NBCW5,This is great glue. I used this for a project with many types of textures of fabrics and it worked great on all of them. Most hot glue I've used doesn't hold for very long and is very stringy. This was so easy to use and holds great with little to no strings.,5
B06W2NBCW5,"It works well. Nothing complicated, it just does the job and I will buy it again. In fact, it's my second purchase. Price is similar to brick and mortar local store, but this was delivered free with Prime, so you can't beat that.",5
B06W2NBCW5,These glue sticks are superb quality. You can use them at any temperature. They stick far better and last longer than any other small size glues sticks. I have tried many different brands over the years. And these rank up there with the most consistent and having the best adhesion. Highly recommend these!,5
B06W2NBCW5,I bought another product on Amazon for my wife - a cloth to polish silver items like jewelry and silvercutlery. She has used the same cloth for many years and it was time for a new one. The glue sticks caught my eye as I was checking out. I have a couple of glue guns on the back workbench that are in need of some glue sticks to make then work. These will fill the bill nicely.Hot melt glue works great for holding cardboard boxes together. I sometimes cut up the smaller boxes and use them in the corners of slightly larger boxes to make a sturdy open top box to hold small items.,4
B06W2NBCW5,No glue sticks are as strong as these in my opinion. These are the only glue sticks we use as this pack lasts us forever everytime we order it. It fits all of our mini glue sticks!,5
B06W2NBCW5,Glue works great for crafts,5
B06W2NBCW5,Great for making ornaments!,5
B06W2NBCW5,Strong glue that has many uses.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Es excelente para mis manualidades,5
B06W2NBCW5,Powerfull stuff,5
B06W2NBCW5,Excelente,5
B06W2NBCW5,Great for all my crafting projects.,5
B06W2NBCW5,i used this with my ryobi mini gun and works great,5
B06W2NBCW5,"Gorilla Glue Sticks...not worth spending money on the knock offs, buy these and the glue won;t crack, peel, or chip with changing temperatures.All my projects wether inside our outside last longer with Gorilla glue sticks. These are for the small glue gun.",5
B06W2NBCW5,The glue is very good it really resistant good value for the money I have it on auto renewal,5
B06W2NBCW5,Always purchase this brand,5
B06W2NBCW5,So I used these for the first time to hold down the cardboard for my paper mache wall shark. I love how strong it is and that you have a little longer work time. The only thing is that it took a while to harden and dry. Have about a 20 second harden time is more than enough but this sometimes took up to about 40 seconds. I ended up burning myself a bit because of the long harden. However it has a really strong hold. It is also holding down some rare earth magnets in some of my other paper mache school decorations and doing a good job with that.,4
B06W2NBCW5,Never again will I purchase a lessor brand.... unless I really really really really really have to.These are the best in the game imo and would be hard to find a glue stick that is better.I would like to see some colors and glitter ones though for the crafters out there.I may not use them but I could see a reason for color stick at least.I could use color sticks to mark parts that I have sealed with locktight or similar.It would be nice to be able to pick a personal color for my shop when doing maintenance on thingsand use color sticks to show what areas have been finished.,5
B06W2NBCW5,"When they get hot, they melt and stick things together!!!!",5
B06W2NBCW5,Perfect for long lasting gluing!,5
B06W2NBCW5,Value for the money these are the mini glue sticks so make sure that you read the description for the size. Quality of these are always good and the glue hold up well with a quick dry.,5
B06W2NBCW5,On time and in perfect condition!,5
B06W2NBCW5,Good,5
B06W2NBCW5,Bought for the price per amount. Do t think theres much difference in hot glue sticks,5
B06W2NBCW5,"Loved the price for the amount of glue sticks u get, somewhat dissatisfied that over time some of the glued pieces fall off",4
B06W2NBCW5,Best glue sticks!The quality is great and it always holds whatever project we have going on.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Use in my glue gun. Holds nicely,5
B06W2NBCW5,Bought these to making ribbon roses. Had tried a million things and nothing would hold the fabric together. Found these and took a try! Love them! Strong hold! Rolled the flowers up and still going strong! Definitely recommend  for art and craft projects !,5
B06W2NBCW5,I used these hot glue sticks for an art project and I was very happy with how well it worked.,5
B06W2NBCW5,"good product, good price, fast shipping.",5
B06W2NBCW5,works as expected,5
B06W2NBCW5,These hot glue sticks are very heavy duty and hold things together very well. Much better than most hot glue sticks I've ever used,5
B06W2NBCW5,Adheres Great value for my money. Heats quickly. Great quality. Best I've used,5
B06W2NBCW5,Good price and shipped fast.,5
B06W2NBCW5,GREAT GLUE STICK,5
B06W2NBCW5,Love this stick great strong hold,5
B06W2NBCW5,Very good glue sticks well does not peel off easily sticks metal to metal very good,5
B06W2NBCW5,I make hairbows and I use this glue! When I have to take it apart I really have to pull hard. That gives meThe confidence that the bow it's going to stay glued.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Arrived on time this size glue sticks were hard for me to find in my area,5
B06W2NBCW5,These are my go-to glue sticks for all my projects. The bond created is excellent. Love them!,5
B06W2NBCW5,"When it runs out, I will definitely buy the same ones. It glues very well and reliably, melts well. Large economical packaging.",5
B06W2NBCW5,Prefer Gorilla glue sticks but they are hard to find in the size we use in store so ordering them here is perfect!,5
B06W2NBCW5,Gorilla glue still did the trick.  Nice clear  look. Worked great for my project,5
B06W2NBCW5,The one stick I used worked great.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Want it to stick imediatly and stay forever heres your product. Will use only this on all projects here out. Made my daughter wedding boquet with it and not a single flower fell out,5
B06W2NBCW5,"I have been using this glue for years. It is a little more expensive than other brands but worth every penny. A little goes a long way and it resists this horrible hot weather and humidity very well. I would never go with anything else because you end up using twice as much product and in the end, spend just as much money or more. Besides, the quality of the glue and the fact that a little goes a long way is the best part. No need to over due it and make projects look ugly from all the excessive glue needed to keep something in place. I make crafts and people complain a lot about their wreaths falling apart if displayed outdoors. So far, I have not had that problem since I started using them over 8 years ago. I use a ton of their products and they all work well.",5
B06W2NBCW5,These glue sticks are super strong. Quick drying and easy to use.,4
B06W2NBCW5,This Stuff is Great in any formHold fast drying and durabilityNo odorGreat price,5
B06W2NBCW5,Este glue es muy bueno,5
B06W2NBCW5,"Takes more heat to melt these sticks, but not a deal breaker.",4
B06W2NBCW5,"I used this to glue in place many of the smaller wood parts in combination with wood glue and screws. but also used it to glue caps together for the cross overs. and glue them to the wood.and glue the wires to the wood so they would not be shifting all aroundSo now if your the person reviewing this review, in the USA we have a product called ' screws ' they may be wood screws, metal screws, sheet rock screws and even screws with anchors for different surfaces.So before reviewing a review, you need to familiarize your self with common products used for construction.  the most insulting part is if you look in amazon and search ' screws ' you get1-16 of over 20,000 results for ""screws""",5
B06W2NBCW5,What I use it for requires it to be able to hold it's shape. It can not do that because it melts too easy. Will be good for basic craft work.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Pero pegan muy bien,4
B06W2NBCW5,As Described,5
B06W2NBCW5,My daughter asked me to get more glue sticks because she's it's super into crafting currently so I got the Gorilla brand. I really didn't think there would be a difference and glue sticks but they're actually. We were using the refill sticks that came with the glue gun itself and then when we switch over these we realize for one the glue got dries clear which is nice and two are just overall feel like it has a better adhesive.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Works great.,5
B06W2NBCW5,This is the best hot glue sticks ever! I  have been doing some DIY projects and been using this to bond items together and its been absolutely the best! I used it to glue fabric and big jewels on a my candles and it bonded it effortlessly! I was worried about the jewels falling off but nope its very secure because of this glue! Ive had bad experiences with other hot glue brands before but this one is the best I will be getting this from now it. It glues on fast and the hold is so strong youll never have to worry about anything you use this on falling apart. its very good quality and I love how many sticks come in the pack for the price.,5
B06W2NBCW5,I prefer this brand because I can depend on it to attach things without worrying.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Well needed for my craft projects.,5
B06W2NBCW5,used for bridal flowers,5
B06W2NBCW5,Trabaja muy bien con su misma marca de pistola de gorila,5
B06W2NBCW5,These work as intended.,5
B06W2NBCW5,"It's even better than I expected! The size is much smaller compared to my other hot glue gun, and it heats up quickly. The glue sticks need to be used in pairs because they're a bit short, but getting the 75c glue sticks is convenient. The glue is clear and looks clean, and it sticks really well. The gun dispenses the glue smoothly and evenly.",5
B06W2NBCW5,These are by far the best glue sticks for crafting or whatever your needs may be. Nothing beats Gorilla Glue brand in my opinion.,5
B06W2NBCW5,"Laptop plastic feet glues aged and after cleaning up old glues use this to glue the plastic feet back to laptop permanently.Bathroom shower head holder glue/suction cup  aged and detached from smooth wall tiles, use this glue to glue the holder to the smooth wall permanently. Glue hooks to walls ect.Different types of chargers + power bars glue to a board - tidy up for easy finding. Glue dash cam cables in car ect.",5
B06W2NBCW5,"I am very happy with these glue sticks my kids enjoy crafts so i generally purchase glue sticks at the dollar tree. I recently completed putting a  door wreath together and felt that i needed different glue sticks that would hopefully have a stronger hold than the walmart and dollar tree brands. Well these worked great, I purchased the mini size ones and they seems to get hotter than the typical brands i was purchasing which was just what i needed they also molded in well with the plastic on the flowers and the branches of the wreath. These are easy to use, they stick good, they come in a recloseable bag and the price is worthy of the product.",5
B06W2NBCW5,Holds good,5
B06W2NBCW5,"I bought Gorilla glue sticks for my hot-glue gun, hoping to maximize compatibility.And I figured mini-size meant it would be a smaller bag. However, it was a huge bag filled with tiny glue sticks that were too small for the gun.",3
B06W2NBCW5,Favorite glue!,5
B06W2NBCW5,I love the bonding power of the Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks.  Holds much better than the others I've tried.  This is now my go to hot glue sticks.,5
B06W2NBCW5,I use these in my glue gun. I like these better. Denise Clissold,5
B06W2NBCW5,"I love how fast these sticks melt and the ""string"" that occurs with glue is very minimal. It does not adhere to seashells however. I was making a gift where I needed to glue twine to a seashell for a finishing decoration. Maybe superglue? I recommend as a quality product.",4
B06W2NBCW5,"These Gorilla glue sticks work great in my mini glue gun. I had run out of the sticks that came with the new glue gun and decided on these ones since everyone knows Gorilla glue products are very good. They are the 7mm or .27"" in size for a mini glue gun. The package includes 75 glue sticks. They make them in the larger size also if needed. I highly recommend Gorilla glue sticks to all other glue gunners.",5
B06W2NBCW5,Wonderful glue. Dried extremely fast. Holds very well. Can be messy if you use too much.,5
B06W2NBCW5,Its hard to beat Gorilla Glue.  I own a woodturning business and I would be lost without this stuff. I use it for everything from resin mold making to attaching tenons on the bottom of my turning blank.  The hold is very secure.,5
B06W2NBCW5,I have tried a lot of different glue sticks and these seem to work the best for me. They seem to be a better quality and a great price.,5
B06W2NBCW5,I ordered minis and needed regular but that's ok cause I can use these too!  They came fast and I'm sure they will come in handy for my old glue gun and probably the glue pot.,4
B06W2NBCW5,"I created these Sparkling silver,Red,White Spiked AirForce1s with these glue sticks ; gun available here on Amazon.",5
B06W2NBCW5,Appreciated sale price as I find the brand pricey,4
B06W2NBCW5,"I ordered these glue sticks so that I could make a custom enclosure for my tortoise out of a sterilite tree box. I cut out the middle of the lid and used these glue sticks to glue wire mesh into it so that I could place a light ontop. I can put many pounds of pressure onto the mesh and it still doesn't budge, but I did add a very thick layer of glue. Best adhesion of any hot glue sticks I have ever used. I 100% reccomend these hot glue sticks for any project.",5
B06W2NBCW5,I will order again. Check the size of your glue gun when reordering glue sticks. These are the mini size.  They worked for my crafts.,5
B06W2NBCW5,"works great for projects out in weather changes, holds very well.  happy with the gorilla glue sticks so far",5
B06W2NBCW5,This glue will hold in arid or humid climates on all surfaces it claims.*Extended exposure to heat like direct sun will melt the bond.,5
B06W2NBCW5,It was easy to use and worked well,5
B06W2NBCW5,"Love them, good quality.",5
B06W2NBCW5,Works well,5
B001AH5EXK,"I saw this item and decided to give it a try. Now, I normally use low temp because I am a wuss about singeing my fingers. But, the cordless feature and how lightweight it was caught my attention.Pros:1. You can use multi-temp gluesticks with this but it IS a high temp glue gun. If you do want a lower temp, either wait a bit after removing it from the base to use it (it will start cooling) or squeeze some on a piece of cardboard and use a toothpick to place your blob.2. This is NOT a rechargeable glue gun. It is a glue gun that sits on a plugged-in corded power base. You can then take the glue gun off the base (it IS cordless) and use it. When off the power base, it stays very hot for quite awhile.3. Because there is not a rechargeable battery in the glue gun, it is incredibly lightweight. Basically just a light plastic body holding a gluestick with a trigger.4. It heats up very quickly and cools down quickly. Allowing you to use it on a project and then quickly store it away.5. It has the power base attached to a holder with a slick pad (teflon? silicon?) under the tip of the glue gun. You have to use the thing to understand how useful this is. You know how you always have to put something under your glue gun in case it drips? You don't with this one. If it does drip, it hits the slick pad. Once the drop has cooled, you can easily peel the glue off.Cons:1. I found that if you use it for a very long period of time (hour+), you might need to let it cool completely down and then start again. It can get a little hot if it just sits for a long period of time. But then that is true of most glue guns.2. It needs a temperature light. It does not tell you when the glue is at a useable temperature. So do not try to force the glue through before the gun has fully heated. You can test by lightly squeezing the trigger and seeing if it is ready.It is the same brand as the little dual temp glue gun that I have had for almost 30 years (I could not find my old one at first, so I ordered this one). That original one is still in perfect working order. This one looks like it will last me a long time also (lol - I will probably have to hand it off to someone in my old age).Give it a try, you will be glad you did.",5
B001AH5EXK,"I have hand strength issues and I do my crafting and a very small space, and there's always a clutter of items while I'm creating. When I was building my ink pad storage system out of foam core board my glue gun cord kept getting in the way and I got so frustrated I could spit. That's when I decided to shop for a cordless glue gun. I watched YouTube videos until I was blue in the face and read everything I could find. I wasn't willing to buy something with a battery pack or something that was commercial grade because I really don't use it that often. I watched several good demonstrations of the surebonder cordless 60 glue gun, and though there were some negative reviews, I took the plunge. The price was right and the trigger looked like it would accommodate my declining hand strength. Was my old guns my hand would begin to shake uncontrollably when I try to squeeze the glue out. I set it up today and did my own test. This baby gets HOT, the glue flows well when you pulled the trigger, and it's easy to use. You do need to follow the directions about putting in your glue sticks and letting them sit in the chamber while it warms up for 5 minutes because I believe if you are in a hurry and can't give it time to do its job that is what causes a lot of problems. I set a timer for 5 minutes and it was ready to go when the beeper went off. Then I put it back on the dock just because I needed two hands and I start of the stopwatch on my phone. I was gluing all kinds of scrap cardboard and cardstock together and it didn't become difficult to squeeze the trigger until it was approaching 6 minutes off the dock! At that point the glue was cooling off a bit, the bond was a little bit more lumpy than I would have liked, but that far surpassed my expectations. I did not get any dripping on the glue pad, I feel confident laying it on its side with the wings so that the glue does not back up into the loading chamber, the indicator light lets me know when it's on, and I don't have enough good things to say about this piece of equipment. I am storing my ancient full-size and mini glue guns just in case I have the occasion to have a group crafting session somewhere. all in all I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a cordless glue gun and didn't want to pay contractors prices for the big name brands with the batteries that you can change out for different power tools. also I didn't want something that you could plug into a USB outlet because I don't have one near my paper crafting desk and it would have been very inconvenient for me. This is a win-win purchase.",5
B001AH5EXK,"Love cordless feature! Wish it was just a tad bit easier to get off the charger and that it outlined the glue sticks required are full size. Other than that, serves its purpose and works great for at a great price!",5
B001AH5EXK,I'm glad I have this!  It heats up well and nice to have one that can be used cordless if you need to!  Works well for all types of projects.,5
B001AH5EXK,I've used it 4 times so far. No drips. Fast heat.Used it without the cord and It held heat for several minutes. Also seems to be solid and well made. Recommended.,5
B001AH5EXK,I bought a bunch of these for crafts because I own an art studio that does classes. They worked great for the most part. I love the detachable gun making it easy to craft. I found that after a couple times of use some of them stopped working though. The trigger jammed & won't allow the glue to feed through. It happened with about 4 or 5 out of the 10 I bought.,4
B001AH5EXK,"This is a first for us. We've had to corded glue guns and Hubby requested a cordless glue gun, so I chose this one. I will say the after you turn it on to heat up, the hot glue lasts quite a while while off the dock. We were able to use it to put Christmas lights around our brick wall. I'd say the heated glue lasts well over 5 mins off the dock. We would heat up the glue gun with the glue stick inserted and then take the glue gun to our location and put a dab of glue on the plastic light holder and then stick to the bricks, we'd do 2 at a time and press onto the brick and let cool for a min before removing pressure. We decorated the brick fence and courtyard this way for Christmas. Then when the holidays are over and we want to remove the lights we will just pull the light with the dab of hardened glue off the brick and then off the lights plastic piece and do it all again next year. Great tool to have in the garage or craft room.",4
B001AH5EXK,"So this works fine.  But you must keep it inserted into the docking station, or it continues to cool.  The ""cordless"" is a misnomer.  So basically it is the same as unplugging a corded glue gun and using it until it cools.  That is what happens with this.  You can take it off the base, but it will slowly cool until you cannot use it and then you have to put it back in the base.  It does not hold a charge.Other than that yeah it works fine.  But I really wish I could get one that holds a charge!",4
B001AH5EXK,It is a glue gun that heats up fast and works well with the material I was working with. It was wonderful that it was a cordless glue gun.,5
B001AH5EXK,"Bought this hot glue gun to try and make the ribbon roses that are currently famous online. Unfortunately, the tip was too thick to be able to do this. I found that even with the tiniest pinch, too much glue was coming out due to how big the tip was that I wasn't able to bend the ribbon. I also had to buy the extra thick glue sticks and ended up buying too many (my fault). The price and quick delivery was nice, though. This heat gun is also a bit tedious in regard to that base. I like that it catches all the glue; however, putting it on and off the stand after each use seems like an extra unnecessary step. I think I would rather have the wire because if the gun isn't sitting on the base enough it won't continue to heat up. Even if it's charging, you could get about 1-2 minutes of use then the glue starts to cool again. When doing projects where I'm making so many petals I would rather have the cord. For projects that require less glueing this could be nice",3
B001AH5EXK,"Love this! the glue stays hot for a while, so you are free to move about without a cord in the way!",5
B001AH5EXK,Was surprised with being able to glue with gun off charger for 2-3 minutes. Heats up fastLightweight!,4
B001AH5EXK,"The description says that it is cordless 3 min, the instruction manual says 2 minutes cordless. I bought this to try and reaffix an ornament on a wreath and having to constantly charge it is a bit much. We already have a corded glue gun, but there's no outlet where its located, so I was hoping this would be the answer. This has bigger glue sticks than my other one, so I'm glad the bundle came with them. I'm sure we'll find a way to use this one.",4
B001AH5EXK,This product works well and have been dropped and chewed in by a dog and still is an effective and efficient tool. I love the port it comes with.,4
B001AH5EXK,"I decided to purchase this cordless glue gun as I always found the cord to always be in the way from where it had to be plugged in. It heats up in a few minutes, but you really only have about 2 minutes before you have to put it back on the charger to reheat. The glue comes out nice and when you repress you can get a continuous flow which i like. I gave it a 4 rating because it's a 2 handed job to remove it from the charger. Sometimes it was a little difficult and I had to hold the charger to pull it out. Otherwise, the glue gun works fine and the price was right.",4
B001AH5EXK,Wished I'd had this long ago it looks so good can't wait to use it.,5
B001AH5EXK,The format of this gun with it being removable from the stand and work without being tethered to a cord is a very good function. Worked well with the Surebonder construction grade glue sticks.,5
B001AH5EXK,"VERY good investment!!!!!!!!!!! Bought this and the Surebonder glue for it, and works GREAT!I recommend sticking with the glue for the gun. Same company.",5
B001AH5EXK,"Love this product, works well for my needs",5
B001AH5EXK,"Love this gun. It heats up in 5 minutes and you can use it in the stand or take it off and it stays hot for a few minutes. I do wish the glue came out in a thinner line but other than that, I'm very happy with it.",5
B001AH5EXK,This is my second Surebonder glue gun. I bought one many years ago when they first came out. Now that I go on crafting weekends I bought the 2nd one to keep with my tool kit. I really like that you can plug into the stand or the gun itself. A trusted craft tool.,5
B001AH5EXK,Exactly what was promised.,5
B001AH5EXK,Great idea for crafts and so much more. Charge it up and glue away bo cords to get in the way,5
B001AH5EXK,"This is a lightweight gun which is perfect if you just have light crafts to do. To get it started it needs 2 glue sticks to get it going.  You can't really tell when it's hot enough to start, just have to wait a few mins to ensure it's hot before starting as there's no other indicator. What I was not a fan of was the glue oozing out when placed back on the base. Depending on how many things you need to glue & for how long it seems that some glue will be wasted. It does have a silicone pad to catch the droppings and it rolls off easily once cooled. I also noticed there are ""spider webs"" when using it. I don't know if that's normal or not as this is my 1st glue gun. I've only used it for lightweight craft so can't vouch for heavier items.",4
B001AH5EXK,"When using you have 2mins off the base that it stays hot, then you must clip it back into the base to reheat. It's hard to use with one hand, while holding something in place as it comes off the base plug hard. I think I'd prefer the corded version or longer off base time to work with it. Otherwise it does what its suppose to do.",4
B001AH5EXK,Heats up fast and love the charger.,5
B001AH5EXK,"I've used plenty of hot glue guns before, as a arts & craft person. I paid the bit more money for this one as one of the things I dislike is the cord dragging across my working space, and this one is cordless once picked up from the docking station. It. Was. Amazing. So much nicer than being attached with a cord.The glue stayed warm enough for flow for about 10 minutes without re-docking it for a few minutes. It heated up in the 5 minutes as advertised.I don't know why people complained about it dripping, I used it for three hours today and it didn't drip *once* - and I'm used to hot glue guns dripping lots, so this drips a lot less than usual. Perhaps because it heats up so fast, that it doesn't need to sit there hot if you need time to change out what you are doing, so you aren't wasting glue. A few times it did start to run out of the tip (but not to drip point yet) was when it was on there hot for about 10 minutes.Its super easy to squeeze the trigger, so I am guessing the folk who complained about that didn't let the glue warm up enough, or they forgot to actually keep 'charging' it back on the station to keep it warm.TLDR: easiest and nicest to use hot glue gun I have ever used in my life",5
B001AH5EXK,The cord is a little short but I get quite a bit done before I have to place it in the holder to charge. Maybe it is the way our house is laid out with electrical plugs.  Great glue gun and came with a plethora of glue sticks.  Would highly recommend.  Arrived on time and packaged well.,5
B001AH5EXK,I love the cordless aspect of this glue gun! It makes it so easy to use when setting things up in my classroom-heats up quickly and keeps heat for a while during use. Highly recommend!,5
B001AH5EXK,I Washed what I glued And it came off in the wash ... But I like the way it works. Will use it on my craft projects.,4
B001AH5EXK,Buen producto buena calidad,5
B001AH5EXK,This glue gun is the best value for the money by far very little leakage it does have a drip tray. I love the size and how it fits in your hand the stand is very sturdy the battery life is phenomenal. I use it for installing LEDs in RC trucks and reinforcing the bodies they're glue sticks are also phenomenal I picked up a 20 pack on sale for $2.24 you cannot beat that I guarantee you not find a better cordless glue gun with their glue sticks for the price. Makes the job a lot easier without the cord getting in the way highly recommend this cordless glue gun if you do a lot of crafting it's awesome,5
B001AH5EXK,Heats up in a reasonable amount of time and I like the cordless option.,4
B001AH5EXK,"This thing is great if you know how to use it but it has ISSUES.First of all... this thing leaks A LOT. Like, im talking piles of glue. If you lay it on its side, the leaking is lessened. It does need to be attached to the cord most of the time but you can lift it from the dock to use it wireless. YOU MAY ALSO DETACH THE CHARGING CORD FROM THE DOCK AND INSERT DIRECTLY INTO THE GUN FOR WIRED USE!!!! I do prefer smaller glueguns but i have a business so i needed this to use with the 77-foot-long surebonder gluestick coil to save money.The leakage is the big problem because the glue just falls out sometimes. You need to wear special clothes and gloves for this and it should NEVER  be used by a beginner or a child!!! Its very large.It can be used off on the charger for a few minutes, and that freedom is unique to this gun. It also is able to produce A LOT of glue in a short amount of time. If you use the coil box and use the dispenser to load the glue, the leaking is lessened. So its good for pros.Not a terrible product for PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LOT OF PROJECTS OR VERY LARGE PROJECTS.",3
B001AH5EXK,I bought this for my classroom but every time it was plugged in dripped alot.  It was dripping a lot of glue as I was holding it without pushing trigger.  I contacted manufacturer and they responded right away and are shipping a new one.,4
B001AH5EXK,It is the glue gun I have ever own and used. I absolutely recommend,5
B001AH5EXK,"I thought this glue gun accepted 7/16"" and 1/2"" diameter glue sticks, but find I am wrong about the 1/2"" diameter glue sticks. It I had to search through the description of this item to find the section that says it accepts 7/16"" diameter glue sticks with no mention of 1/2"". I have a supply of nominal 7/16"" diameter high-strength glue sticks I wanted to use with this glue gun. Much to my surprise I find they will not fit this glue gun. They have a somewhat rough finish and are also somewhat out of round. Their diameter ranges from .43"" to about .46"", so maybe that causes the problem, but the bottom line is they do NOT fit this glue gun. You can start them into the feed mechanism but they quickly jam.",4
B001AH5EXK,Heats up super fast!  Exceeds expectations.,5
B001AH5EXK,The best glue gun I have found so far! Easy to use and no tangles!,5
B001AH5EXK,"I like the idea of cordless it come with a stand that you can plug the cord into the stand or gun to charge. I had noticed that the packaging was opened and I could see glue on the tip and glue stuck inside of the gun.I had waited for this to arrive. The gun itself is nice but you really have to squeeze hard for the guy to come out. I called on the glue in the gun and also there was a part missing. Amazon offered to take of something,it was $2 or return thegun and wait another 5 days. I had a project, has anyone else had a problem squeezing and getting glue out?",3
B001AH5EXK,"Heats better if you don't heat in the stand. However, stand is nice to place the gun when project completed. Gun heats nicely and easy to use.",4
B001AH5EXK,Heats up fairly quickly. Easy to use for general gluing. Would need a finer tip for delicate work but for crafting this is great!,4
B001AH5EXK,"Only high setting, so A LOT of glue gets wasted as it drips from nozzle.",4
B001AH5EXK,"Works well, surprised there wasn't at least 1 glue stick.",4
B001AH5EXK,"Cordless and easy to use. Just what I needed for crafting, love it!",5
B001AH5EXK,Did not like that it does not stay on long when off the charger,3
B001AH5EXK,I wish it was easier to remove from stand while doing crafts but it has a long lasting battery. It charges fast. Warms up quickly and uses the standard size glue sticks.  Over all I do like it.,4
B001AH5EXK,The purpose of having a stand is so that you do not have to put the gun down on the counter while you are working.  But the electrical cord plugs into the bottom of the gun exactly where the gun rests on the stand.  Dont spend  the money for the stand.,3
B001AH5EXK,Love the size but you have to charge 5 minutes to only get 2 minutes of use.,3
B001AH5EXK,"I bought this glue gun June 20th. It just stopped working a couple days ago.  No warning or anything. The red charge indicator just quit. It won't heatWorked great, till it didn't.I am buying a different brand.",3
B001AH5EXK,Love the cordless glue gun,5
B001AH5EXK,I love this glue gun. I am ordering a second for my classroom. I love that it is cordless. I would recommend this to anyone.,5
B001AH5EXK,"great item at a great price. thank you, will definitely order again. more power and God bless!",5
B001AH5EXK,"my only complaint is that it is a little hard to pull out of the charging station. That may loosen up as time goes on and I use it more, we will just have to wait and see.",4
B001AH5EXK,"While shopping in a Joann's store I came across this same glue gun.  I liked that it was cordless and the base plugs in to charge it.  It seemed a little pricey at $27.99 but I thought it was worth the hassle of fighting a cord every time I went to use it.  Before I checked out I decided to look at amazon for the same one and I got it on a deal of the day for $12.99.  I was ecstatic and couldn't go fast enough to the aisle I picked it up in to put it back!.  Amazon is my go to site for pretty much  anything and they surely didn""t let me down on this purchase!!!",5
B001AH5EXK,Wife loves doing crafts when her heavy duty glue gun quit and all she had was a light duty glue gun to finish a craft item she started I decided to get her a cordless glue gun which she always wanted,5
B001AH5EXK,"I was so excited to get this glue gun. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in it's performance. First thing is it's not easy to remove it off the stand with one hand while your other hand is holding down what your going to glue. Then when you do get it out then squeeze the trigger the glue comes out in a big glob. There is no controlling the amount of glue that comes out. And then returning it to the stand is a challenge of it's own. I am so bummed. I will be returning it.",3
B001AH5EXK,NO glue sticks included.,4
B001AH5EXK,I thought this would be great for us here. We use the hot glue often and I liked the idea of being able to move it around further from an outlet. If you are like me and already burn yourself with a regular hot glue gun don't buy this one! It gets so hot it melted everything i touched with the tip. Literally.  I returned it so we didn't end up with blisters all over our hands.,3
B001AH5EXK,Love the flexibility of being cordless. Heats well. Drop off makes clean up easy,5
B001AH5EXK,My long used cordless GG died and after much research I settled on this one. Well worth the money.,5
B001AH5EXK,Love it. Works Great  Cordless so easy to use,5
B001AH5EXK,Great size. Was able to use it all over the classroom. Love the stand so I don't get hot glue all over the place and also I'm able to see when it is heated up. Sturdy and like that it's the thick glue sticks to really get stuff to stay on the walls or areas of my classroom that we need all year. Desent battery life as I was able to do two bulleting boards with a charge. Could have done more but I stopped. The drip tray is great so you don't get hot glue every where.,5
B001AH5EXK,Item as described,4
B001AH5EXK,Works well. A little awkward for using at times. Overall does the job.  Value seemed a little high,4
B001AH5EXK,"Great for crafts, party supplies, and household items and repairs. The glue gun holder is sturdy and easy to use. Hi temp is accurate in description. Consider using finger tip protector while securing glue to items.",5
B001AH5EXK,I love this hot glue gun. I especially love that it's cordless and comes with a stand to rest it on!!! Very easy to use,5
B001AH5EXK,"I feel like this gun leaks so much glue. I wouldn't know comparing to glue guns made recently. I have not used a glue gun since the early 2000's. There is a huge mountain of glue on the tray if you don't use it fast. I did find that having it lay down is a good solution to the leaking glue. I like to have it stand up for easy access. I do love that it is cordless, and it does last a while off of the stand. The stand is the one with the cord connected. Even though it is cordless you always have to have the stand connected to power.",4
B001AH5EXK,"Heats quickly and holds charge for several minutes . Does not come with glue sticks, though.",4
B001AH5EXK,I am a crafter of many things this glue gun is handy to have. I no longer have to stay near a receptacle I can use it any where. It stays hot it does have a auto shut off incase I forget to turn it off which is handy .The price is great!,5
B001AH5EXK,"I like the versatility of the glue gun. It is very hot , so caution is needed when using.The one downside is that one has to remember to turn it on!. (I am used to glue guns that begin heating as soon as they are plugged in. In reality, this is more a safety feature than a downside.)",5
B001AH5EXK,"I do a lot of crafting.  This works amazing,  heats quickly. The stand with the drip tray is fantastic.  And no cord makes it so much more functional, I definitely recommend.",5
B001AH5EXK,so I love arts & crafts and was looking for something different it work out great heats up quickly easy to use,5
B001AH5EXK,"You're going to see some negative reviews, don't believe them. I don't know what these people want or what more the guys who made this thing could do to satisfy them but man this thing is awesome. Yeah it's a wireless glue gun what else do you want? Of course you can't use it forever indefinitely without having attached to a power source. Of course that's just common sense that's just how batteries work. So if you're using it for a large scale project that is going to require constant high temperature gluing then this may not be the appropriate tool or the job therefore the problem is not with the tool it is with you the user who have now made themselves into a tool. For my needs basic crafting little handy jobs around the house whatever it's perfect it's ergonomic fits nicely in my hand holds a large capacity of glue and has a nice smooth transition between sticks Yes the tip does run but it has a catch plate for that there's thoughtfulness and the design. The haters are going to hate but this thing looks cool functions great and it's fairly inexpensive. I think this is a home run for any hobbyist crafter or handy person. I'm more than satisfied.",5
B001AH5EXK,Works great. Takes a little longer to heat up than what I am use to. But it works great an I love that it has no cord!,5
B001AH5EXK,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Full size glue gun works very well,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Okay, can I just say I'm addicted to decoupage? I love it. I really do. And Mod Podge is a great product. But to be 100% honest, this one is a challenge to really get behind. The smell is pretty strong--stronger than regular Mod Podge, which also ""announces it's presence with authority"" odor-wise. This one is really stinky and one must have a source of ventilation when using it. (At least I need to. I have a bloodhound's nose.)The other thing about this one is just the annoyance factor. I wanted a product that would essentially waterproof a series of mason jar glasses that I was designing for a Christmas present for friends and family that enjoy iced coffee. But in order to get these things to cure, I will need to start and finish this project during OCTOBER, for Pete's sake!It takes a whole month for this product to completely cure. I just don't see how this is practical in any way. When one makes a product, one naturally wants to use it right away, or at the very most, in a week. But having to wait an entire MONTH for the product to cure? Not practical in the least.But, in all honesty, the product works beautifully. I made a trial drinking glass, let it cure the 30 days, and it worked like a dream. I was able to put iced coffee into the Mason jar, enjoy the drink, and then wash it by hand and air dry without the stickiness or loss of finish that happened when using normal Mod Podge previously. The sweating of the glass container when containing iced coffee on a hot day didn't seem to affect the art work, and as I said, clean up was flawless and caused no ill affect to the artwork all around the outside.So, in conclusion, it does work very well, IF one cares to wait the entire 30-day cure time before using one's beautiful glass. ;)",5
B00JX1OFDU,"I make custom products, and this is one of the most useful tools I have. The product works just like it says and last a long time. It's easy to apply, has no odor, and seals very well. Just be sure to wait the entire 30 day curing period before placing items on the top rack of the dishwasher. I've made that mistake and had to reapply the Midge Podge. It did; however, keep the decoration in place, so it wasn't a total loss.",5
B00JX1OFDU,"I decorated some coffee mugs with paint pens and coated them with this type of Mod Podge and it still holds up perfectly, seals the paint and has stayed clear through lots of use and washes.  I love this stuff!",5
B00JX1OFDU,Used this to glue a puzzle that I wanted to frame. Worked great and dried pretty quickly!,5
B00JX1OFDU,"It works well, but apply in a ventilated area (as it is pungent) and prepare for the 1 month curing/wait time before using the product its applied to",4
B00JX1OFDU,The coasters were layers of fabric decorated with block print designs. This dishwasher-proof glaze was a delight to work with and never smeared the designs. I used the whole jar.,5
B00JX1OFDU,"The Dishwasher safe Mod Podge is great for crafting. I picked up some inexpensive clear glass plates, decorated them with Christmas papers, sealed them, and used them to present Christmas cookies. They looked great and can be washed and reused throughout the holiday season.",5
B00JX1OFDU,"As a mama who wants to spend more on activities than on products for our household, I could not recommend this product enough! We love giving gifts in our home and we love giving gifts that show remembrance. So we have used this craft bottle for almost every single gift that we gave from Halloween to Christmas! It is a great deal and a really good bank for your book! The way that we used it was with ornaments and pictures! So we were able to do a lot of thoughtful giftgiving this year and I owe it all to Modge podge!!",5
B00JX1OFDU,"I bought this to use on my paper beads that I make. I have not tried to get anything wet to see if it is waterproof, but it looks nice on the product. It shipped fast and was well packed.",5
B00JX1OFDU,I needed this for a project for a Stanley cup and it was perfect!!,5
B00JX1OFDU,"I painted on some glass jars with glass paint that needed to be heat set. In addition to that, I wanted to make double sure that they were going to be dishwasher safe. Found out ModgePodge made this product and ordered right away.  Worked great! I can wash the jars in the dishwasher or by hand. The glue has added an additional layer to ensure that my paint stays in place.",5
B00JX1OFDU,did not test the waterproof qualities yet but it was easy to apply and looks good.,4
B00JX1OFDU,Worked great on a wooden project for the out doors. Loved using it,5
B00JX1OFDU,Good,5
B00JX1OFDU,"This did seal stickers on a metal cup, and saves them from the dishwasher, but it did leave brush strokes. I would use it again",4
B00JX1OFDU,"Everything I use it with, whether mixing it with acrylic paint or brushing it over cardstock/paper images, ends up looking beautiful with a pleasing texture rather than something rough or uncomfortable! It stays wet exactly as long as I would want it to to be able to adjust my craft but without having to wait too long for it to dry!",5
B00JX1OFDU,Great product but was delivered with no cap.,3
B00JX1OFDU,I love this stuff. I made some stemless wine glasses for someone and they've held up 2 years! this will always be my go to adhesive,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Very nice water based glue, collage base and sealer. Been around for years for good reason. Great product.",5
B00JX1OFDU,Good,4
B00JX1OFDU,I bought this to use for my crafts making glasses. I bought this product a while back so I can give it a honest review. It does how up to dishwashing. Though you do have to wait the 30 days before putting it in the dishwasher. I tried it sooner and my images started to come off. I like the way it goes on smooth. I had no issue with this. I would buy again.,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Great for diamond painting, helps protect and dries very clear",5
B00JX1OFDU,I guess i should have checked before i needed to use it immediately.  Opened the top and saw the silver seal was opened.  I pulled the seal the rest of the way off - not sure what full should look like exactly but it was 1 CM down.  In the future i will check.  Won't know if the product is waterproof until late.,3
B00JX1OFDU,"I have 4 identical coffee mugs 3 of which had broken handles. I gathered all of the pieces and took my time putting the handles back on with this amazing product a few months ago. To my surprise, the handles stayed together. I wash them in my dishwasher every day and so far so good. Did I mention, this stuff even works as a glaze? So, not only do I have my favorite mugs again but they are all shining like new!",5
B00JX1OFDU,Very mindful and bery demure,5
B00JX1OFDU,When I sealed and delivered. I do mean no flaking no excess glitter sealed to perfection!,5
B00JX1OFDU,Like the cost.  There is nothing i dislike about the product,5
B00JX1OFDU,Arrived good Not used yet,5
B00JX1OFDU,This has worked great to keep my diamond dots together!,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Originally bought it to paint mugs. Used modge podge after using acrylic paint on mugs. Followed all the directions to try to make sure I was doing so correctly in terms of number of layers, curing time, etc. They cured for over a month before being run through the dishwasher (top rack). Dishwasher totally destroyed the decorations on the mugs. Was not a fan of modge podge.However, later, I had two puzzles to try to glue for hanging. One had already been glued to a backboard but the puzzle glue really didn't work and the backboard peeled right off, as did much of the puzzle. So I figured I had a ton of modge podge left. Put down some wax paper and used a rubber brush to spread modge podge on the front and back of the puzzle (two layers on each side, drying then rotating between layers--change wax paper as needed too). Worked very well. No backer board needed at all. If you plan to hang it on hooks, 4 layers is great. If you plan to stand a puzzle up freestanding, you will need more layers or a backboard, as it will bend, especially the 1000 piece or larger sizes. Learned the hard way.I was able to finish two puzzles using most of the bottle since I had only otherwise used the bottle for two mugs. Since modge podge redeemed itself in this manner, I may buy more later. Wish it would have worked for the mugs though.",4
B00JX1OFDU,Used this on some coffee mugs that I designed with vinyl to protect the vinyl.  Seems to work very well but I still hand wash the mugs just to be safe.,5
B00JX1OFDU,Decoupage,5
B00JX1OFDU,These modpodge products are excellent,5
B00JX1OFDU,Works Great if you follow the instructions.,5
B00JX1OFDU,This was ok.,4
B00JX1OFDU,"This super versatile.  You can use it to cover almost any art or craft activity.The Podge goes on smoothly and cleans up with water.It cures to be both transparent and water resistant. (It claims to be dishwasher safe, but I have not put that to the test.)I have used it on three craft projects with very good results.I am a fan.",5
B00JX1OFDU,"Crafting again,  great for decoupage .  Mod Podge is our go to glue. For gluing fabrics and papers to objects.  This one is water proof and dries to a gloss.  Perfect thickness not too goopy.  Dries quickly to a clear color and has not yellowed .",5
B00JX1OFDU,"Purchased this to protect granddaughters artwork that she put on a mug using water soluble paints.  It sealed well with minimal brush strokes and should do the job.  Not sure about the dishwasher claim as we wont try that, but it, like all Mod Podge products work well.",5
B00JX1OFDU,WHAT?! Dishwasher safe mod podge!?! I used this on travel tumblers that I painted and it worked like a charm!  How fun!,5
B00JX1OFDU,Gotta layer it up alot but it works perfectly,5
B00JX1OFDU,This is good stuff it works great,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Like the title says, it works.",5
B00JX1OFDU,I order this to use on a tumbler that was autographed by Disney characters. I let it dry for 3 days until I finally washed the tumbler. For the most part it worked except on part of the tumbler started peeling off. Not sure why when the rest of the tumbler was fine. For that reason I gave 4 stars,4
B00JX1OFDU,I bought to do crafts. It works wonderful. I love this brand cleans up easily.,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Nice to have the option to be able to wash something. I will probably just hand wash anyway, but I think will be safe in the dishwasher after curing.",5
B00JX1OFDU,Works great.,5
B00JX1OFDU,Works like it's suppose too. Does a good job.,5
B00JX1OFDU,Was looking for a product that I could use on my plates that I add fabric to and still be able to wash them. This was exactly what this product did for me. Will purchase again.,5
B00JX1OFDU,Worked as advertised wish it was more sticky,5
B00JX1OFDU,"The ease of adhering versatile materials will inspire you to create with this lightweight, simply designed product!",5
B00JX1OFDU,As a first time user of Mod Podge I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was an excellent experience.  Easy to use following the instructions on the bottle.  Easy clean up.  Excellent results.,5
B00JX1OFDU,LOVE IT!! This is great for all types of crafts.,5
B00JX1OFDU,Great. My wife is happy.,5
B00JX1OFDU,Will smear some types of ink,4
B00JX1OFDU,"This variation of Mod Podge applies just like the original and appears to seal the same. I cannot vouch for the dishwasher safety as I have not tested it. I used it to seal some diy glitter key chains to protect them from some light raindrops or something. Mine has held up well, so I'm happy.",5
B00JX1OFDU,Very versatile to use!,5
B00JX1OFDU,The mod podge came with no twist cap just the plastic cover. I have no way to seal it.  Would like the twist cap.,2
B00JX1OFDU,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We had the kids bring these Stanley mugs to Disney World to get them signed by all the characters in a sharpie pen. And I wanted to make sure that the signatures lasted. I glazed them in this and let them sit for 28 days. Now we will have the signatures last forever!,5
B00JX1OFDU,"A wonderful versatile product!  Many uses, and safe to use!",5
B00JX1OFDU,Great product,5
B00JX1OFDU,Have not used yet but I know I will like it!,5
B00JX1OFDU,It has become impossible to find the dishwasher safe mod podge around us  Amazon to the rescue at a really good priceThe cure time is almost a month but it seems to work if you follow the directions!,5
B00JX1OFDU,Exactly what I need to finish all the mothers day gifts I made,5
B00JX1OFDU,I bought this to try it.  It doesn't smell strong  is easy to use..,5
B00JX1OFDU,Do not use on items for outside if you are worried about the colors fading. . This does not keep UV rays from fading items.,4
B00JX1OFDU,"Works great on porcelain and glass, the only two materials I have used on so far. Works like a charm and as claimed. Not sure if it is intended as a patch. With patience and multiple coat was easily able to patch a small hole too. I wish I had found this sealant years ago. Would have saved me from messing with two part adhesives or super glue types.",5
B00JX1OFDU,I did apply 3 coats due to my project plus 2 coats of polyurethane. I wanted it sealed very well for easy cleaning.,5
B00JX1OFDU,My first time using this but a lot of my crafty friends rave about it. I used it on a few Christmas gifts so I hope it holds up as it says it does: will be buying more,5
B00JX1OFDU,Its alright and does what it says . Its nearly impossible to get it on smoothly unless you spray it on . I've used every brush on the market to no avail.  It does the job I dont like the obvious brush strokes though.,5
B00JX1OFDU,I used this mod podge to seal a dried pressed rose onto a concrete rectangle necklace. It worked great and is very thick and durable. Keeps the rose preserved and sage from water and daily wear and tear. Will definitely keep using this product! I love all the mod podge variety of glues/ sealants. Great quality and durability. Will purchase again!,5
B00JX1OFDU,This was very easy to use for sealing my birdhouse gourd.  The texture is very smooth.,5
B00JX1OFDU,My dimond pictures to seal them.,4
B00JX1OFDU,Just what I needed and it came very quickly,5
B00JX1OFDU,Works as described,4
B00JX1OFDU,"This product arrived having leaked and because of that it completely wore off the label. I tried to leave feedback but oddly this product doesn't appear on my seller feedback page. This product is easy to use, however, it didn't cross my mind to not use the heat setting on the dishwasher. The entire design moved and bunches off and I peeled off nearly all of it. This may have been on the bottle instructions, but I wouldn't know since the label was ruined and I couldn't leave seller feedback. When I see dishwasher safe I assume that includes all settings on the dishwasher, including heat. That said, since the label was completely erodes, maybe I didn't even receive the right product. I made Christmas gifts with this so now I'll have to give the disclaimer to hand wash only.Update: This time I redid the mug and handwashed the item after about 15 hours. The the glue started coming off in strings. Since my label was gone due to glue being all over the package it would be nice if there were directions on this page aside from them talking about how amazing their products are. Usually, I agree. But this time I'm super disappointed. I was going to give 3 mugs at Christmas gifts and now I feel that I can't or have to say don't drink from them or wash them!",3
B00JX1OFDU,"I just recently bought this and have a couple of projects curing. According to the label, it has to cure 28 days before being dishwasher safe. I'm still not convinced it will survive the dishwasher, but I guess we'll see. It goes on easily just like regular mod podge, and clean up is just soap and water.",5
B00JX1OFDU,The dishwasher safe mod podge was just the thing for me to seal inkjet printed vinyl stickers on tumblers to make unique gifts for my friends.  I did spray Rusteoleum 2X clear gloss on the stickers first to make sure the ink wouldn't smear when I added the mod podge and it worked like a charm.,5
B00JX1OFDU,"Totally enjoy its ease of use, easy to clean up and its ability to preserve wearables. I've used it to replace jewelry sealant (plenty contain toxic ingredients) or nail polish which isn't so durable.Thanks to this, I definitely get to wear my jewelry statement pieces daily and for months. It is also useable over semi-precious stones. After curing, pieces can be washed.",5
B00JX1OFDU,It leaves a visible coating which drives me crazy. However the product absolutely works as expected.,4
B00JX1OFDU,Easy to use,5
B00JX1OFDU,I bought this to seal vinyl over glass but it made the glass look frosted when it dried,3
B016LDV41S,"This cutter is fantastic.  It cuts precise cuts, and when you get used to the guide, very straight lines.  I love the safety latch also.  It's light weight, but very sturdy.",5
B016LDV41S,"This is not the heavy duty cutter you had in school or at your office. And if you plan to use it a lot, or for multiple sheets at one time, don't buy this one because you will be disappointed. But for my purposes, it works great. This is a VERY lightweight product. It is made of lightweight plastic with a thin metal blade. I was stunned by just how light it is. But that makes it easy to move around and use anywhere.I use this cutter at home to trim cardstock and decorative scrapbook papers for making handmade greeting cards. The size of it will take one of the large 12 x 12 scrapbook sheets but nothing bigger than that. The description says that this will cut 10 sheets of paper at once but that would be a real stretch I think. I wouldn't try to cut more than 4 or 5 layers of paper at one time and I am most comfortable with no more than three sheets of paper. More often, I am cutting just one sheet at a time and I am happy with the results. It's not going to cut cardboard, vinyI or anything of the kind. I find that it will cut two sheets of heavy card stock at a time. I have cut three but that is more difficult and I have decided its just better not to cut more than two. The cutter does a nice job cutting single sheets of  scrapbook paper but does not cut really thin paper. Anything like a tissue paper or piece of gift wrap will be folded under rather than being cut. Notebook paper and heavier cut beautifully. Thinner paper like notebook sheets actually cut better when you cut more than one sheet at a time. It cuts single sheets of photo paper nicely also.The cutter makes nice, straight, clean cuts. I love the guides and measurements which make it a breeze to get a square cut to the proper size.I suspect that with heavier usage the blade might dull pretty quickly, But for my at home, light use this has turned out to be an excellent low priced product.",4
B016LDV41S,"Awesome for the price, works perfect, very sharp",5
B016LDV41S,"Certainly! Here's a sample product review for the Swingline Paper Cutter, Guillotine Trimmer:Title: Precision and Efficiency with Swingline 12"" Guillotine Paper CutterI recently acquired the Swingline 12"" Guillotine Paper Cutter for my office, and it has proven to be a reliable tool for precise paper trimming. This guillotine trimmer combines efficiency with safety features, making it an essential addition to my workspace.Clean and Precise Cuts (5/5):The Swingline Paper Cutter delivers clean and precise cuts effortlessly. The 12"" cut length is versatile enough to handle various paper sizes, and the sharp guillotine blade ensures smooth and accurate trimming. It has become my go-to tool for achieving professional-looking results in document preparation.10 Sheet Capacity (4.5/5):The 10-sheet cutting capacity of this trimmer is impressive, providing the ability to handle multiple sheets at once. While it performs admirably with standard office paper, it's recommended to adhere to the specified sheet capacity for optimal results. The sturdy build of the cutter contributes to its ability to handle moderate workloads.Safety Features (5/5):One of the key highlights of the Swingline Guillotine Paper Cutter is its safety features. The protective guard and latch mechanism ensure that the blade is securely covered when not in use, minimizing the risk of accidents. This design prioritizes user safety and adds peace of mind when working with the trimmer.Durable Construction (5/5):The trimmer's durable construction is evident in its sturdy base and overall build quality. It feels stable during operation, and the metal base adds durability to withstand regular use. The construction instills confidence in the longevity of the cutter, making it a reliable choice for ongoing paper cutting needs.Alignment Guide for Accuracy (4.5/5):The alignment guide on the Swingline Paper Cutter is a helpful feature for ensuring accurate cuts. It assists in positioning the paper for precise trimming. While it works effectively, a slightly more visible or adjustable guide could further enhance the accuracy, especially for intricate cutting tasks.Compact Design (5/5):The compact design of the Swingline Guillotine Trimmer makes it a space-saving solution for my office. It doesn't take up much room on my desk or in storage, yet it delivers the cutting capacity needed for various paper-related tasks.

B016LDV41S,Really nice in cutting cardstock for cards. And has a safety latch too. Made well,5
B016LDV41S,"If you need a basic paper cutter and don't really care that the cuts are perfectly even. This will do the trick.However, if you need to make very clean perfect cuts, keep clicking.Here are the problems1) Cuts aren't even. Follow the instructions, hold the paper down with one hand and start your cut and you'll notice the paper starts to bend as the blade goes through. Cut fast, cut slow, doesn't matter. Unless it's a heavyweight cardstock, the paper will bend and this will affect how straight your cut is. This may be a problem with most guillotine style trimmers but it was bad on this one.I tried cutting sheets with lines printed on and couldn't get one perfect cut. Disappointing.2) The ruler is sticker and was bubbling out of the box. The ruler is a critical feature if you're trimming photos and the ruler on this unit won't last. Higher quality trimmers will have a ruler that is either engraved or painted on.3) It's too light. Yes it's easy to carry around, but you need to hold it down firmly when using it as the friction of the blade and the down pressure of the cut will make this trimmer want to move.",3
B016LDV41S,"blade is nice and sharp and this does work well.  however, the body is plastic and very light weight.  makes it a bit awkward sometime as the blade is heavier than the body...may break but so far so good.",4
B016LDV41S,"Overall, a great product. Easy to use, sturdy, but not heavy. On the trimmer I received, the measurement tape was ""bunched up"" which caused some challenges in measuring and lining things up, but it was easy enough to pull it up and fix it.",4
B016LDV41S,Daily use as I am a crafter worlds amazing and is durable,5
B016LDV41S,Good for what it does chop the paper. The sticker in the middle kinda started to lift off a bit maybe use stronger glue on it :),5
B016LDV41S,Sharp blade to cut tissue paper and crepe paper! It works great for my use! Love it!,5
B016LDV41S,This is a quality product for the price.,5
B016LDV41S,I absolutely love this paper cutter. I used a Fiskars for so long and needed a new one and someone recommended it and I bought and I am so happy to have gotten this one and would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!,5
B016LDV41S,Works great.  Cuts smooth.,5
B016LDV41S,"Got tired of my paper cutters fraying the edges so I googled the best guillotine, this was it, cuts like butter until you get to the last few inches, then it needs a little more push.",5
B016LDV41S,"I just got it, so I hope this isn't a hasty review.  It's not level, it wobbles, kind of lame but besides that it's nice.  I got mine for cutting photo paper so that's what this review is about.  The first cut I made.  Either the paper wasn't squared right or the thing is off or I'm a newb to it.  It cut a funny even though I had the top flushed tight with the paper.  Then next cuts I decided instead of flush against top to flush up top right and visually align bottom right to edge of where cut will be made, worked perfectly then.  Sometimes hard to see that way but oh well.  It sliced nicely through the photo paper and looks a lot better than the scissors cuts I've been using.  Since it's cheaper to print a 8 x 10 on letter size photo paper and cut it than it is to buy 8 x 10 photo paper.  I just spent $400.00 on a Sony RX100 and got a nice Cannon MG7520 printer on Amazon on clearance, beautiful set up.  I then stocked up on three sizes of photo paper and found after market inks by Greensky less than a dollar a cartridge.  So I got this to complete the ensamble.  It's solid and has some weight to it but is light enough when I'm done I just stand it up on end next to my printer table and it takes up no desk space, I just grab it when I need it.  I grabbed the blade like an idiot when I put on the handle but luckily didn't cut myself, so be careful when putting on handle, give it a nice little bump (handle) and it will lock onto end of cutting blade. I can't believe this one rates better than the wood ones I used in school and see online but it does which is why I bought it, kind of wanted a nice solid wood one, but if it doesn't cut as good then what's the point.  I did notice a bolt underneath to control blade tension, but it's fine factory set for now.  Blade is flushed up nicely with base edge and feels like a quality item, besides being not level and a bit of an wable when using it sometimes.  They sell this cutter for $35.00 dollars sometimes so put it in  your cart and wait till it's $25.00.  Wish there was a way to hang it on the wall on a nail or screw so it doesn't get dirty on my floor but I didn't see one.  Anyway, I'm satisfied so far for my five or six cuts on photo paper and it beats scissors hands down.  Not for children though these even with the finger guard are dangerous and need caution to be advised with this type of tool in the home.  Last note is not sure but maybe unscrewing that bolt on bottom is possible to take off cutting arm for sharpening or replacement.  I'm guessing you get years of use at normal to low usage levels before that is needed and then at this price it's probably cost effective to just buy a new one at this price and arm with shipping from manufacturer can't be cheap.  Here's a joke for ya!  If an arm is expensive imagine what they want for a leg.  LOL.  I would recommend this item for general light usage goals, doubt it cuts twenty sheets nicely at once.",4
B016LDV41S,"Cheap and arrived quickly. As I was taking it out of the box, a little plastic piece fell out which broke off during shipping which is a little piece of the handle. When I was installing the handle I cut my finger. be careful!  there are no guards.",3
B016LDV41S,"This is a decent paper cutter, it works well and the blade is reasonably sharp.  The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is because it's not truly square.  I suspect that's because the base is molded plastic and there's going to be some deviation with that, but it'd be nice if the company would actually test the accuracy of it.  Otherwise for a light duty paper cutter, there's little else to compare in this price range.  Update: A minor complaint; the built in ruler is graduated at only 1/8"", it would be more useful if it had 1/16"" or even better 1/32"" graduation marks.  Otherwise you have to approximate if you want to make a 3/16"" trim for instance.",4
B016LDV41S,"Pretty good little paper cutter. Light weight. Sharp blade. Graph on surface for cutting alignment. Storage is a bit of a problem (especially if you have to remove the handle).  The lock for the cutting blade is flimsy. This paper cutter needs adult supervision; personally, I would not allow anyone over the age of 13 to use it.",4
B016LDV41S,"-1 day later edit -My review was published and the thumbnail image of the cutter in my email showed this HUGE green handle that I'd never seen before. My cutter apparently shipped without it. I never saw it because the cutter was loose in a brown Amazon box... I'm guessing other cutters had a retail box showing the complete cutter and perhaps an instruction sheet. Apparently my cutter was ""pre-loved"" before I received it.If you don't receive one with a handle, this cutter is pretty bad. I would guess that having a handle makes it a better item. The stub that the handle plugs into should not be used for cutting.------------------------------Original review follows-----------------------------As a paper cutter, this one is honestly incredible. The blade is katana sharp and the tolerances are extremely tight. It slices through 10 sheets with zero effort at all. It's extremely easy to line up a printed line with the cut edge. As a cutter, this thing deserves MORE than 5 stars. It blows away the most expensive ones I've ever owned. I've needed these for my business for the past 20 years.The ergonomics are basically non existent. The ""handle"" very much requires those quote marks. It's minuscule. A doll hand dwarfs the ""handle"" on this cutter. You can wrap maybe two fingers around it. It is much safer to just put an open palm on the top side of the blade and press down. The handle invites you to get a finger sliced off.The ""printed"" scale on the top is very very faint. The molded in grid does follow the inch marks, but only roughly. The scale and grid don't quite match.The ""lock"" hides underneath the blade and is nigh impossible to activate without flipping the unit over and puzzling over the thing. But the whole unit is very lightweight, so it isn't hard to pick up.Seriously, that handle is a cruel joke. It would be better off not having it at all.Summary:Actual paper cutting: Godlike. S-tier. Best in show.Chances of losing a finger: Extremely high. Very dangerous. Do not use when drunk.",3
B016LDV41S,WOrks great,5
B016LDV41S,"Obviously was returned for the handle missing. Other than that it works great and is super sharp. The base is pretty flimsy plastic, but it cuts fine. I cut multiple pieces of card stock for business cards easily.",4
B016LDV41S,Good quality and easy to move around,4
B016LDV41S,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but after receiving it, I see what others were saying about the green safety bar being in the way, it does take some getting used to but works great.Biggest con, I could not get the lever unhooked from the safety latch. I had to unscrew the whole lever. Which is OK, I will be the only one using it and there are no children in the home.",3
B016LDV41S,"Great product! So sharp it sliced my fingertip off. It is actually pretty safe, I just got distracted.  Please use caution people!",5
B016LDV41S,"I was hesitant to buy this paper cutter. I remember the huge ones from kindergarten. They were dangerous. I am accident prone...so, that was my underlying misgivings towards it. I knew I needed something different from what I had initially bought. So,  this was my next option. Once I read the full description, read some reviews and overcame my fear I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad that I did. The measurements were easier for me to understand and the accuracy was spot on. I overcame my fear quite easily once I witnessed that the blade will stay in place, not suddenly drop down, until you grip the handle and guide it down to the contact point.A couple things give it a 4 star, but I don't know how it could be changed. I want to point it out, even though it sounds silly to mention, for future purchasers. Some may read this and even say duh. I completely understand. I am not presuming anyone is ignorant either. 1. The blade is SHARP. If you take a look at it you will notice that it looks like a machete. Even though the paper cutting point is when the blade meets the metal plate that runs horizontally along  beside the blade when you push the blade all the way down. It will still cut ""you"" if you accidentally touch that blade. For instance, do not raise the blade, decide to reposition the paper, take you hand off the blade handle and reach with that hand to reposition the paper. You ""WILL"" get cut. Nor do you reach one or both hands to reposition the paper. Again, you ""WILL"" get cut. ALWAYS be mindful of where the blade is. If for aome reason you need to reposition the paper, and the blade is in the way, lift the blade just enough to unobstruct the paper, keep your hand on the handle, then slide the paper to the point that is needed and push the blade down and cut the paper. In simple terms, always be mindful of where the blade is and never curve it to the left or right. It will hit the cutting plate and make a sound much more annoying than nails on a chalkboard.  I hope this long review helps you.",5
B016LDV41S,Very sharp  cuts larger pieces of paper not just 8.5 x11 inch.  Use it for crafts,5
B016LDV41S,Just like the old brick my teacher used to have in her classroom but feather weight in comparison with the same straight cut.  I would highly recommend.I made copies of my passport and laminated them.  This unit trimmed them to perfection.,5
B016LDV41S,"I love my paper cutter, but please be careful because the cutting blade is sharp.It has a locking guard that is nice for your protection.",5
B016LDV41S,"As a calligrapher, I use a paper cutter fairly regularly. For the longest time I had a cheap sliding paper cutter that always snagged. I finally decided to invest in a better quality one. I purchased this Swingline paper cutter used-like new from Amazon and am very pleased with how well it works. Makes cutting place cards much easier!",5
B016LDV41S,As described. Cuts paper and other stuff. If you need to cut/trim paper this would work.,5
B016LDV41S,"This was so lightweight when I picked up to package on the porch, my first thought was oh no this isn't going to cut all this invitations, thank you cards, name cards, programs, etc. We are talking few hundred items. But I am thrilled to tell you it did the job it cut the last just as perfect as it did the first. I have several other Swingline products that have always been great, I never should have doubted this one. I'm sure we will be using this for school assignments and lots of other things for years to come.",5
B016LDV41S,"It's a mostly good cutter, you just have to make sure you bring the arm down at the correct angle, and it definitely does better on bigger papers.  The only thing I really didn't care for was that the platform is very lightweight and you have to hold it down when you bring the arm back up.",3
B016LDV41S,"The only downside I have experienced with this product is that I find it hard to line up forms to cut along straight lines.  My use has been limited, but thus far my experience has been positive.  Cutting effort is not difficult and the blade is sharp.  I am sure it will dull, but it appears that the blade can be easily replaced.  I would recommend this for small volume cutting situations, perhaps five at a time.",4
B016LDV41S,You can easily cut paper but I can't lock it when I want to pack it away.,4
B016LDV41S,"It works great, but there is nothing in the way of the blade when it's in the locked position. A small strip of plastic in a number of places would have stopped me from cutting myself 3 times now.Sure, I could be more careful, but I truly don't understand why the blade is fully exposed while locked. You will cut your finger while picking it up eventually.",3
B016LDV41S,"I wanted something inexpensive to keep in my cubicle at work because I like to print things and cut them to size on my cubicle wall, and since I can't cut a straight line to save my life with scissors, I looked for an actual desktop cutter like this one.I've worked with other guillotine cutters in the past and love how easy they are to use, and this one is no exception.For the price, this is perfect, but it is *not* a heavy-duty cutter. I have accidentally messed the blade up by attempting to cut too many sheets at one time. I knew better. I'd say that 5 sheets of normal 20 lb paper is the best for accurate cutting, and any more than that and one will chance the paper sliding and/or making a rough cut.This slices through single sheets of cardstock with ease. The board is a good size, 8.5x11 paper fits edge to edge, landscape.I highly recommend for light-duty projects.I do wish the non-slip pads on the bottom were a little larger, because this does still slide around on my desk because of how lightweight the unit as a whole is.",5
B016LDV41S,"Works well. The blade lock is kind of sketchy and I feel like it's very possible to cut yourself if you're reckless with it. My child hasn't lost any fingers yet, but time will tell.",4
B016LDV41S,Cuts great. Just the right size and lightweight.,5
B016LDV41S,Cuts true.,5
B016LDV41S,"solid tool for any office or craft space. It cuts through up to 10 sheets effortlessly with precision. The 12"" cut length is perfect for various projects, and it's lightweight yet sturdy.",5
B016LDV41S,"Very lightweight, cuts with precision, and the blade is very sharp.  It has a latch on the bottom that keeps the blade locked in place when not in use. I've only cut 3 sheets at once, though it states at least 10 at once. Very easy to use",5
B016LDV41S,"I've been using this trimmer for about a week and feel confident about leaving this review, even though I cannot know if the blade will sharp indefinitely.  I think there are some great things about the trimmer, and some that aren't so great. I am a paper crafter so my usage has been related to those purposes.Great aspects:1.  Blade is sharp; easily cuts a single layer of 110# card stock. as well as 20# copy paper.  I haven't cut multiple layers as accuracy is more important to me than cutting in bulk 2.  Lightweight yet sturdy.  Doesn't slide around on desktop.  Easy to move around and store. 3.  Work surface is large enough to cut 12"" x 12"" paper or card stock.Not-so-great aspects:1.  The only thing that keeps this trimmer from getting 5 stars is its measuring capabilities.  If you have excellent eyesight and don't need to cut the utmost accuracy, you will probably be satisfied, even pleased with this trimmer.  a.  The designers have chosen aesthetics over function by using a pale gray color for the inches scale on the top of the trimmer. Against the darker gray body, it's very hard to read if your vision is compromised by age or disease.  b.  The scale on the top is marked in 1/8"" increments which is OK, 1/16ths aren't that necessary but would have been appreciated.  The problem for me is the top scale markings don't go all the way to the edge of the paper stop (very hard to describe), so when the paper is butted against the paper stop at the top, there is a gap between the paper and the scale, making it hard to be accurate.  c.  There are two scales about 5 inches down; the top one is metric and the one below is in inches.  If you are cutting something longer than the 5 inches, this helps line up the left edge, but if you're cutting something shorter, you must rely solely on the upper scale.  d.  The guillotine blade doesn't lift very high at the pivot or connection point, so requires extra attention to be able to slide paper or card stock up to the paper stop.  It would be nice if it rose just another inch.If you just need a paper trimmer for tasks that don't require a super accurate cut, and if you're young and/or have excellent eyesight, this could be a great trimmer for you.  The cost is low, the build quality seems very good.  But if you don't see well and need contrast between markings and background, this will probably just frustrate you.I will use this another week or so to see if any 'work arounds' come to me to make it more accurate for my poor vision, and if not, I'll return it to Amazon.",3
B016LDV41S,"I use one just like this at my school so wanted one for at home. I love having one at home, too. Super lightweight, portable, and easy to store. It cuts all my paper perfectly!",5
B016LDV41S,"I bought this to cut card stock for business cards! Got a great deal on this, even without the deal, I think it is well worth it. Super sharp and cuts like butter! The cuts are super clean and is very easy to use. Efficient at doing repetitive cuts and large quantities of cards like I did!",5
B016LDV41S,"I don't know if it's just me, but trying to cut exactly on the line is difficult because I can really tell where I'm supposed to line up my paper. I try to eyeball it, but I'm continually missing. It's super sharp, but I don't like how light it is. One bump and it could totally go flying. Kind of dangerous.",3
B016LDV41S,This has saved me so much time cutting papers for flyers. Cuts evenly and can handle thick papers.,5
B016LDV41S,"too light weight, I was hoping for a little heavier duty unit",4
B016LDV41S,"I wasn't sure this would be sturdy enough for my uses but i trusted the brand, Swingline, as I had used it before in a large office setting.  This cutter is a gem.  I would definitely but again but doubt I will need to because it is sturdy, sharp and fits my needs perfectly.",5
B016LDV41S,"I bought this in exchange for a paper cutter that did not do the job well.  This cutter trims paper and heavy stock well.  The price is good, but the cutter arrived with some of the screws not screwed in fully flush.  I screwed in 2 offending screws and now it works very well.  If your looking for a good cutter that's cheap, this is the one to get, though you may have to finish what the factory started.",4
B016LDV41S,"It works fine. Just be careful, sharp blade lol. Wish the handle was easier to put on, But its fine.",4
B016LDV41S,"This cuts paper perfectly and is lightweight, and easy to use. Even has a lock to immobilize the blade for transporation.",5
B016LDV41S,The initial quality was good and cut through a few sheets of paper easily. I've had the cutter for one month now and the blade is already dull.,3
B016LDV41S,"I got this cutter for personal use and am happy to have it.  It actually performs better than I thought it would.  I particularly like how lightweight the device is and the blade is sharp so you get nice cuts.  It also has a good safety feature which I feel comfortable with.  For home use, I would recommend this.",5
B016LDV41S,As a teacher I use a paper cutter in my classroom.  I have tried several types and this by far is the best.  Would recommend to anyone.,5
B016LDV41S,"This isn't nearly as sturdy as one might hope and so the handle and blade can wiggle a bit. This means that cutting thin/flimsy things can result in them bending downward away from the loose blade instead of cutting, or when you cut something thicker, the handle might start to flex. It get especially noticeable if  you are cutting toward the bottom of the board, far from the hinge. If you are cutting just the right thickness and staying high, close to the hinge, then this things works great.",3
B016LDV41S,"It isn't the best. It can't cut really thin strips off the edges of regular weight paper, it just folds it over. It's very light. Lightweight isn't a feature when you need something sturdy that isn't going to move as you operate it. Nonetheless, it works well aside from the aforementioned issue, and is worth the price.",4
B016LDV41S,"I have used these paper cutters for years and they are great. But a friend needed one, so I gave away the one I had and bought this one, just like the one I gave away.",5
B016LDV41S,I should of bought a paper cutter like this along time ago. Thank you.,5
B016LDV41S,Life saver,5
B016LDV41S,Great paper cutter. I use it for my classroom all the time. Love that I can cut multiple papers at once.,5
B016LDV41S,You get what you pay for I guess! And that's what I get for buying the cheapest one. Not worth the hassle to return will probably trash it unfortunately,3
B016LDV41S,I purchased this paper cutter 5 months ago and I cannot be more than happy with this purchase! get the job done quickly!,5
B016LDV41S,"I bought this to make packaging for keychains for my online shop. I cut many sheets of cardstock as well as light cardboard. I even used it as a wire cutter, although that isn't the intended purpose of the product. While reading some low reviews, I feel like these people expecting too much. Immediately after opening the product, I noticed it was super lightweight and made entirely of plastic, meaning it shouldn't be dealt with too roughly: 2-3 sheets of cardstock at a time, or maybe 5-7 sheets of regular printer paper.The protection guard came in handy, but I think the lock mechanism for the blade is in too awkward of a position. I had to be super cautious locking and unlocking the blade, because the mechanism just doesn't come out or go in smoothly.Overall, this product does the job for the price that I paid, and for what it is.If I had the space, I would get a more study, and larger paper trimmer, but this works very well in terms of portability and for my small desk space.",5
B016LDV41S,very light weight and so I am able to store it on top of the 6' book shelf so the children don't get tempted to play with it. Cuts accurately and I'm glad I got it. Saves me many trips to the office stores.,5
B016LDV41S,"ProsVery lightweight, does the job it's supposed to do and it wasn't a huge chunk of money out of my pocket either. I work in a kitchen at an assisted living facility where we need to cut the meal tickets every morning by meal, and I get this to save us time. Bought it a good month or two ago and it still works great.ConsOnly a thing or two. One is that you need to watch the blade as it does not come with a cover so just made sure to keep it all the way down when you are done. Second is that I have noticed over time I believe the blade is getting dull near the handle and is tearing the paper. I'm sure if we found a knife sharpener and went at it then it would fix the issue, but I thought I would point it out. I would also point out I have been cutting around 100+ pieces of paper a day for around two months, so it's getting in a good amount of use.Also a third con is that it is SO lightweight that when you lift the blade it can lift the entire piece, so just make sure you either hold it down or have something on it as you work!",5
B016LDV41S,"I was looking for a good paper cutter that wouldn't take up much space, was light weight and did the job I wanted it to do. and this is it. the only thing I would warn against, is the blade is super sharp, which I expected, but I have accidentally banged my fingers on it a couple of times, so that is how I know. so when using it, be careful. I haven't tried it on multiple pieces of paper as I am currently using it to cut through laminate sheets, and it works perfectly. I was using one of the hand held cutters that you slide the blade and it kept moving on me so would cut the paper crooked. I don't have that issue with this one. I would recommend to a friend.",5
B016LDV41S,Cuts perfect love it,5
B016LDV41S,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So this one is not my fave. The item is made of an inexpensive plastic and does not seem very durable. It will not cut through a piece of laminated paper without shredding the side of it. As you can see in my video I folded a piece of cardstock in half and then half again and it struggled to cut that. I believe this will be a return, as there are much higher quality items out there!",3
B016LDV41S,Outstanding lightweight product for the home office user. Highly recommended!,5
B016LDV41S,Put it this way I used it today. Got cut twice. Once on each hand. Big nasty cuts too. The blade is completely exposed with 0 protection for you. Please wear gloves if you must use this death trap.,5
B016LDV41S,"Been using this for a few months now, wanted to give an honest review.My take aways:  I love the fact that it's a very lightweight and small enough to store away easily for quick use. This piece is not intended to have much weight to it, I think the wood models are meant for that, but also fetch more than double of the price of this guy.So if you are in a pinch, and have always had your eye out on one of these to add to your arsenal, pick this guy up, you won't be disappointedWould definitely recommend this product to someone else!",5
B016LDV41S,This paper cutter beats all that I have seen and I've looked at seven or eight others.  My only complaint isit is light weight.  I dd add weight to the underside.  The lock is good for the paper blade.  an quality product.,5
B016LDV41S,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As seen in the video, that is what I wanted one for and is invaluable for my purpose.  It makes the job of trimming up images so much quicker and accurate.  Is it possible to get a cut without it?  Yes but what a waste of time.  It was be way too much messing around when I can do it quickly and easily.If you need a Guillotine style trimmer, look no further, this is it.Highly RecommendedFive Stars *  *  *  *  *",5
B016LDV41S,But works fine,5
B016LDV41S,"This thing can cut you but just looking at it. it's that sharp. My only issue is with the measurement. I bought this to cut iron-on vinyl for my shirts. At first, I used the measurements to cut. But found myself cutting off to much material. I eventually found that when I measure from the blade, I get a better cut. I feel like the 1-inch mark should start from the blade. But these cutters are a must for any craft project.",5
B016LDV41S,"I liked the safety lock very much. Even though it's out of reach from my children, it's a security measure that I am thankful for. Anything can happen.I didn't like how I did not think about how hard it'd be for me, a left handed person to use it. It gets some getting used to.",4
B016LDV41S,"The paper cutter is great. Light, easy to handle and cuts great.  Excellent value. The delivery was  nothing short of amazing!!!  I ordered this item about 9pm and shortly after went to bed.. before I woke up the next morning it was on my door step!!  I could not have received it any faster, even if I had left the house to find one at the store.. Amazon Prime rocks !!

B07K791YRP,I've never owned one before so I can't compare it to other brands but this worked perfect for me. Easy to use & works fantastic! I had a project of gluing some painted wood gears to a clock that worked out perfectly! Now I'm finding out all kinds of things I can use a glue gun for! Definitely a must have!,5
B07K791YRP,This is just a glue gun that has a stand attached. What makes this glue gun worthwhile is the quantity of glue strips that came with it. That made it a good deal for me.,5
B07K791YRP,"If I could give 10 stars, or better yet hearts, I would.I wanted to make some glitter foam ornaments.  I had a glue gun to use.  A big one, because I glue cardboard together and need wide coverage.  Not good for small work.  The nozzle is too large and there is no fine control.  I bought a small one. Only the small one didn't get hot enough.  The foam would come apart as soon as you let go.Enter this Gorilla gun.  It has a small nozzle, has a high and low temp. and is perfect for small work.  As far as that goes you could use any small multi temp gun... but this one does NOT OOZE!  You can loose half a stick of glue while you position a piece.  Not with this gun.  I can fuss with my piece all I want and even lay the gun on its side and not one drop comes out.  This makes this a super gun to me.  I have precise control, can get small portions of glue where I need it and not one drop is wasted while I work.  I don't know why this gun has this feature and my other two don't but I am so glad I bought this one!  Just to be on the safe side, I would get the gorilla glue sticks too.  Bead work is a breeze and fixing small statues, jewelry and anything small or narrow, (glitter foam is 2mm thick) is made for this gun to assemble or repair.Is there a down side?  I haven't found one yet.  The hardest part of using a glue should be waiting for it to be ready.  Patience is good for that.  That and plugging it in before you set up your work surface and assemble the parts you are going to work on.  Remember... it will not start oozing glue waste before you are ready to use it.If I find any down side I will come back and post it here.I don't think I will be doing that though.  Great gun!Jan 28th 2021:  well the trigger part went south.  My son opened it up and placed a metal spacer to replace the plastic one, but the other end of the trigger part broke. The plastic innards are not as efficient as the heating part.  I have been spoiled by the fact that the glue does not drip out and will leave the gun on too long.  That is probably not good for the health of the inner plastic.  I still love it and am getting a new one.  I will be careful to not try to glue anything until I am SURE the gun is ready to use.  I am sure that is part of my problem.  A sure fire way, is to get some glue on the outside of the nozzle before it cools off. And not start using it the next time until the glue on the tip starts to drip off.  This is still a great gun, I just have to learn to be a great user!  Also, be sure to get the gorilla sticks too.  Some of the medium ones i bought for the first non gorilla gun do not work as well.  (I might give that first gun a chance again now that I have good glue to use in it, but this one will always be my favorite.)",5
B07K791YRP,"The best glue gun. Small enough to fit beautifully in my hand, light weight and I can easily squeeze the trigger to a beautiful flow of glue. I'm 72 with RA and this glue gun is perfect.",5
B07K791YRP,"I bought this to repair my cat tree.  I just used it for the first time, and I couldn't be happier.  Highly recommend!",5
B07K791YRP,Bought this to build projects with my grandson. He takes scrap wood and builds various items that he wants. It is safer than a drill and screws or hammer and nail.,5
B07K791YRP,Great glue gun. Spectacular price. Works very well! Came with several extra glue sticks,5
B07K791YRP,Ive been carrying it around the house looking for stuff to stick together. Infinite uses. Hot glue is a dynasty,5
B07K791YRP,best glue gun!,4
B07K791YRP,"Gets the job done,thx.",5
B07K791YRP,"Great product, like the rest of gorilla glue products",5
B07K791YRP,Seems durable. Used it twice so far and no issues yet.,5
B07K791YRP,What a treasure.  It heats FAST and works great.  I wish it had an on/off switch instead of needing to unplug,4
B07K791YRP,Good,5
B07K791YRP,Good for the price,5
B07K791YRP,I'm glad I ordered this mini glue gun. It's better than those previously used. Heats up quickly and doesn't leave a dripping mess of glue when setting it down.,5
B07K791YRP,Love the quality. Comfy to use,5
B07K791YRP,"Good mini hot glue gun. Dual temp feature is nice, and comes with plenty of glue sticks.",5
B07K791YRP,Working out great for my project.  I would order again if ever lost!,5
B07K791YRP,"Worked well for the project, but went thru a lot of glue sticks",5
B07K791YRP,Glued a cardboard box shut for shipping and worked great!,5
B07K791YRP,"I plugged it in, and within 5 minutes I had repaired a treasured Christmas ornament!Appreciate having 2 heat settings.",5
B07K791YRP,Nice size for my use.,4
B07K791YRP,Works great!,5
B07K791YRP,"This is great for small glue ups, just wanted a full size.",4
B07K791YRP,Got for my wife.  She can't put it down.  Crafting like crazy,5
B07K791YRP,This is a nice little glue gun. Easy to control the flow and be very precise. Ideal for crafts and smaller applications.,5
B07K791YRP,easy to use,5
B07K791YRP,Loves this. Use it all the time,5
B07K791YRP,To use you have to keep feeding the glue sticks all the way to work.,5
B07K791YRP,"small, quick to heat",5
B07K791YRP,"This is perfect. I normally use a rechargeable glue gun. But this one is great for my smaller projects, even better with the 2 different heat settings. The only reason I only gave it 4 starts is the face there is no power button for it.",4
B07K791YRP,"I ordered this mini glue gun to replace an old one that still worked, but would waste so much glue dribbling out the nozzle.  The reviews were good for the Gorilla glue gun so I ordered it and have used it several times already.  It's nice that it was a high-low temperature control and just as the other reviewers stated it barely leaks glue out the nozzle when resting.  The glue stick feed mechanism also has a better grip on the glue sticks, so there is minimal slippage when pulling the trigger.  Overall this is a good product at a good price.",5
B07K791YRP,Product is super simple to use and holds well for small tasks,5
B07K791YRP,"Works well, nice small size.",5
B07K791YRP,"I have another brand that is the same size, but it always drips. This one doesn't!! Love it!",5
B07K791YRP,Very good!,5
B07K791YRP,Loved,5
B07K791YRP,I love the size and the weight of this glue gun as well as the little stand to help keep dripping hot glue out when you set it down. The hi and low heat is great because you can control if you need lower heat for more delicate items.,5
B07K791YRP,"I love using Hot Glue Guns to hold things steady until the other parts totally dry with glue. Sincerely, CoffeeTimeWithCindy.com",5
B07K791YRP,quality isn't what is once was,4
B07K791YRP,The high/low settings and small size make this glue gun perfect for crafting and delicate projects.,5
B07K791YRP,It came with the glue sticks.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.,5
B07K791YRP,It will work on smaller projects  Yes after I ordered saw the mini but think the larger gun is nicer to handle with more volume of glue sticks,4
B07K791YRP,"Every crafter needs a glue gun! This one is nice because it comes with the glue, saving some time. It heats up pretty quick and is just like every other hot glue gun.",5
B07K791YRP,"I got this hot glue gun for a crochet project, and I must say it works great. This is the first glue gun I've ever used that didn't drip constantly. I used the low setting to attach crocheted pieces together, one made of cotton yarn and one of polyester chenille yarn, and it held up perfectly. I love the little kickstand. It's the perfect size, and the fact that it comes with 75 glue sticks is a huge bonus. I used to be afraid of hot glue guns due to my history of burning myself with them, but this one actually makes me want to do more hot glue projects.",5
B07K791YRP,Works good and very easy to use.,4
B07K791YRP,Very strong Adhesion,5
B07K791YRP,Works really well.,4
B07K791YRP,This is my favorite craft tool!! Heats up fast,5
B07K791YRP,"Simple to use, no mess, and Gorilla-strength bond! Very pleased, enough glue-sticks to last a long time. Great feature, the legs that prevent messes. Thanks, Amazon!",5
B07K791YRP,"I'm not sure what kind of crazy genius came up with the idea of a dual-temperature hot glue gun, but I'm convinced they're trying to make me a master craftsperson. Or, at the very least, a master of making a mess.The Gorilla Dual Temp Mini Hot Glue Gun Kit is like having two glue guns in one - and by ""two glue guns"", I mean ""two ways to get your project wrong"". But hey, that's what makes it so much fun!The low temperature setting is perfect for delicate projects, like gluing together a fragile vase or a tiny unicorn figurine. And by ""perfect"", I mean ""utterly useless"". Because let's be real, if you're trying to glue something delicate together, you're probably going to end up breaking it anyway.But the high temperature setting? That's where things get REALLY interesting. It's like having a blowtorch in your hands, minus the whole ""being able to control the flames"" thing. I used it to glue together a piece of cardboard, and it came out looking like a charred remains of a failed science experiment. Artistic, right?",5
B07K791YRP,It's been a few years and I still have my mini glue gun. It works perfect still. Any previous brand I have bought has never lasted me more than a few weeks. I'm satisfied!,5
B07K791YRP,Love the thoughts of it being mini but it doesn't heat up like the regular size there for the glue is not as hot,3
B07K791YRP,I figured using a glue gun for the first time would be a disaster. I needed to replace the sisal rope on my cat scratching post. It has been a few weeks since applying and it is holding up very well after letting the rope dry appropriately. The gun was very easy to use and the glue came out evenly melted and no mess. I am now ready to hot glue anything and everything!,5
B07K791YRP,This is your typical glue gun however it has dual temperature which I thought could be useful. Easy to use.,4
B07K791YRP,"I use hot glue all the time and bought this for making small, precise streams of hot glue. It works ok, nothing overly special. But the main thing to think about is this doesn't have an on-off switch so don't leave it plugged in and forget to unplug it.",4
B07K791YRP,this little guy is awesome and does a good job for odd projects glad it was on amazon,5
B07K791YRP,Gave as a gift because it was rated as best.,5
B07K791YRP,Bought this to finish some projects around the house until we finish unpacking. It works very well.,5
B07K791YRP,"I was hesitant to buy this due to reviews talking about how it drips. Ended up getting it anyway because other brands/models had the same complaints.Maybe it's because I only use it for a few minutes at a time and then turn it off when I'm done, but I haven't noticed any dripping at all. I'm also using the gorilla brand sticks that came with it, so maybe that's a factor.The only thing that I have noticed is some very fine strings/threads that trail off from the gun after applying glue, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a property of hot glue and not some flaw.I think I'd like if the gun itself had an on/off switch like my soldering iron does. I do like the indicator light though, and the built in stand. Also it heats up pretty fast, which is nice.",5
B07K791YRP,"One of the best glue guns on the market! I purchased one for work, and I immediately bought one for at-home use. Easy to use, heats up quickly, and the glue does not drip. Highly recommend!",5
B07K791YRP,I use this during the holidays because it is just a perfect size for packages and making wreaths.  I love the size.  I can take it with me and use anywhere!,5
B07K791YRP,Great glue gun compared to many others it has a hi and low . Includes a kickstand  on  the under side of glue gun . Heats up quick .,5
B07K791YRP,My kiddo really loves doing crafts with me. The low setting is perfect cause it dries quicker and isn't as hot. Plus the size fits in her had perfectly! Great addition to the craft corner,5
B07K791YRP,"...but the tip definitely leaks. I bought this to attach new rope to a scratching post, and the glue seems to be holding up well to my cats' enthusiastic scratching.My work surface was a stainless steel prep table, and fortunately the cooled glue was easy to pick off, because the whole time the gun was plugged in, there was a slow but steady trickle of glue coming from the nozzle.The price isn't bad, and Gorilla is a known brand. If you don't mind a little mess, this might be worth your while.",3
B07K791YRP,Good.,5
B07K791YRP,"There is no power button on this, but it has a rocker switch, that switches between the high and low settings. If you want this to power off like that, you'll need to plug it into a surge protector etc. and flip the switch there.Besides this, it does have a flip out stand which is indispensable and hard to live without.I haven't noticed anything with its heating or melting the glue sticks.I haven't timed it, but I'd say it still takes a while for it to heat up. I'm not sure if it truly gets hotter on the high setting vs. the low setting and no, the glue won't scald your fingers, that's the nice thing about these glue sticks. I used to have some off colored - yellowish ones that can't be purchased anymore that really burned me.These glue sticks by the same gorilla brand are really good at binding materials, once the glue starts to cool it does have a reasonable working time, as mentioned in the listing.Also, there is no safety internal shutoff. If you leave it on and walk away it will just stay hot indefinitely. At least with the built-in stand, it's safer.Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase and have tossed the cheapie, I bought at Walmart years ago.",4
B07K791YRP,Gets hot and does what a glue gun is supposed to,5
B07K791YRP,"This is by far the best glue gun I've ever purchased! High quality, heats up fast, comfortable to hold, and you don't have to fight the trigger to squeeze the glue out. The glue comes out smooth and consistent plus there is a switch for high and low temps. It is miles better than my old one and I can tell it'll last me a bit!",5
B07K791YRP,My go to for quick projects. Sealed accidental cut in pvc vent pipe. Glued decorative glass panels to cabinets to stop glass rattling where clips were used.,5
B07K791YRP,"This product is very good. Works great, love the stand.",5
B07K791YRP,"I had a mini glue gun that I have used off and on for several decades.  It was time to find a replacement.  I tried one that was not worth what I spent on it - and it was cheap.  I read the reviews on the Gorilla gun and thought it might work well -- it does.  I like that it has two heat levels.  It is easy to use and I was able to control the amount of glue applied very easily.  My only complain (and others said this, too) was that it needs a stand to set it on.  If I'm working on a piece and need to set it down, it won't rest on the end opposite of the nozzle - it just falls over.  I will be looking around to see if I can find something that would serve as a glue gun stand.  I got this on sale and with 75 glue sticks - it was a great buy.",5
B07K791YRP,"I only used it once, on low temperature. The plastic nozzle sleeve melted in use. You would think that a name brand product would hold up to its specific use, but not in this case. The glue function works fine so it gets three stars. But I've only used it three times and it's already messed up, which is not a good sign with regard to its longevity. Would not recommend.",3
B07K791YRP,Great glue gun,5
B07K791YRP,This is really top notch. Small but effective.,5
B07K791YRP,It is a great tool for non professional use. I have used on various materials including fabric and never disappointed. It sure is worth the money.,5
B07K791YRP,"It's all in the title. I have used this gun on a bunch of house projects so far, and even found some potential new hobbies by trying to find additional ways to make use of the gun and glue. It's a pretty neat little tool, and everything I stuck together has stayed together unless I broke some other part of the item(s) I glued while testing the limits of the glue's adhesion properties. So far so good, great product",5
B07K791YRP,This is so great.  Does not burn your fingers as it gets hot but not like some glue guns that burn your fingers if the glue gets on them.  Also love the stand  that keeps the glue gun upright.,5
B07K791YRP,"I use this for various simple tasks around the house and find it very easy to use.  I've had many glue guns over the years but I picked this one up when my last one burned out because I've become a big fan of the other Gorilla products.  So far, this has been my favorite one I've owned as it fits my hand well and is simple to control.  Dual temperature settings is nice to have as my previous one did not.  I have noticed (as I'd hoped) that the Gorilla Glue sticks are of higher quality than my previous brand as well, glad I picked up an extra bag of 75 of them.  All in all, you cannot go wrong with this little guy for craft type work.  If you required something massive for heavy duty work this probably isn't the way to go but it's holding everything I've used it on so far just fine.",5
B07K791YRP,The last glue gun I purchased got tossed in the trash pretty quick.  It leaked MOUNTAINS of glue while it was waiting to be used.  It got glue all over.  This one is a more trusted name in glue and the gun work great.  The stand even works if I need to stand it on a sofa or other unstable area.  I just wish it has an on/off switch.  I really hate plugging & unplugging every time i need my glue gun.,5
B07K791YRP,Can't really complain. Used it a bunch and can't find anything to dislike about it for the price.,5
B006P1EQXA,"I've just started gathering the things I need to establish a crafts shop, where I plan to sell merch at cons and online.This paper is really high quality, and if you're already considering it, worth getting. This paper is excellent for general use, and feels premium. It isn't suited for making print-and-play cards, however.Pros:- takes ink really well (pigment, ET8550)- thick and sturdy-made a deck box with it, feels high-quality enough to remain intact with a lot of use- paper is very brightCons:-not rigid enough to resist bends: can't be used to make proxy or playing cards on their own, because a stronger bend will definitely remain in the card. This makes them not suited for riffle shuffling.-not quite thick enough to equal a TCG playing card: it is just barely short if you don't layer it with other paper, but it's certainly very close. I've pictured 20 cards side by side (left: weiss schwarz, right: 110lb cardstock)",5
B006P1EQXA,This has been excellent.  Good quality and a nice heavy weight.  Good value!,5
B006P1EQXA,"Great product. Thick cardstock, can be used in many applications",5
B006P1EQXA,"Before you buy, know that this is a very lightweight cardstock, probably somewhere between what you would imagine cardstock to be and a regular printer paper. I saw the reviews before purchasing, so I knew what to expect, and because of that I'm a happy buyer.This is perfect for my Etsy shop. I sell acrylic pins (among other things), and I needed a lightweight cardstock for printing out my backer cards. These are lightweight enough to go through my printer easily, yet sturdy enough to bend and flex - NOT wrinkle or fold - in storage and shipping. I don't want to spend too much money or make items unnecessarily heavy for my customers to pay to ship, so I think this is absolutely perfect. I also use this light cardstock for making ""thank you"" inserts for packages.If you know what to expect from this in terms of thickness, you'll be happy with the quality and amount for the money. Just know what you're looking for, and if you want something thick, this isn't the product for you.",5
B006P1EQXA,Buena calidad,5
B006P1EQXA,"Arrived with the wrapper torn in several places, but enough of it remained to keep the sheets together.",4
B006P1EQXA,Someone suggested this paper for card base and stamping/alcohol makers. I expected it to be thick but it isn't. I'm sure it will be fine for the printer given it's weight but I cannot use these for card bases. Came intact without damage but I won't buy it for cards again. I'll stick to the 110lb from Recollections brand (Michael's).,4
B006P1EQXA,"The paper's packaging was partially ripped open and some of the paper was dirty as a result. I'm not sure if it was shipped like that or something that happened while in transit, but it was disappointing.No complaints about the paper itself though.",4
B006P1EQXA,"We are getting to the bottom of our most recent ream, and ready to reorder. Decided to look up if others had found a difference between the two sides (to us,, one seems rough, one smooth on this most recent ream, which we hadn't noticed when purchased before). Seems those of us who feel it is different are in the minority! I'm going to reorder, anyway - the stock meets our needs for printing things like our own greeting cards from photos, etc., in terms of weight and brightness, cost and promptness of delivery. But I will try to post when I receive and open the new pack - interested to see if it is smooth on two sides or not!",3
B006P1EQXA,It works,4
B006P1EQXA,"I was very disappointed with the thickness, feels more like 65-90lb. I also bought a 90lb pack at the same time and that one was more between the 24-65lb. Color and smoothness of the paper is nice but the weight is way off. I compared it to my other 110lb cardstock and it doesn't come close to the weight. Thankfully, because the quality is good, I can still put it to use.",3
B006P1EQXA,"Great paper, but 1/4 of the pages arrived with bent corners from how it shipped. Makes it hard to print products for sale when so many of the pages are damaged.",4
B006P1EQXA,Cardstock is not thick. I needed this for necklace hang tags but this paper was not thick enough,3
B006P1EQXA,This paper is my preferred for printing. Also the same high quality.,5
B006P1EQXA,"I ordered 110lb but beware the GSM is only 120 ,(see label).  Not true 110lb (GSM 300).  I was disappointed but will use as 65lb.",3
B006P1EQXA,"Ive bought different brands of cardstock, all 100Lb, that are WAY thicker than this cardstock. It says 110 lb and its not even close to 100 lb. Its honestly closer to 60lb than 100. It is a bright white and its good for other things but not well for card backs for sticker packaging.  Its flimsy and can easily fold. The print quality is good. But Im not sure why they are advertising it as 110 lb.",3
B006P1EQXA,"The paper is good, but is it all in there? It came open on both ends! Not cool!",4
B006P1EQXA,"A package and the description on this website States the paper is 110 lb., but in person with 110 lb paper I have purchased at my local craft store, it is much lighter weight. It is more in line with my 65 pound paper. I still use it, but not for what I has planned.",4
B006P1EQXA,Perfect better price than Staples and delivered,5
B006P1EQXA,"The texture of this paper is so good! So far I have painted with acrylic, markers, and ink in this paper.... NO PILLING! Very sturdy however with the moisture of the paint, the edges did curl up a bit.I don't print with these as they are used for commissioned art.",5
B006P1EQXA,Read the description. This product is not heavy enough for card making. It is 110 lbs index not 110 lbs cover.,3
B006P1EQXA,Love the quality of this paper.  Will repurchase again,5
B006P1EQXA,Nice and sturdy for my project.,5
B006P1EQXA,This is the only printer paper I will buy I love it worth every penny! I accidentally ordered the 90lb Neenah not terrible but I knew something was off I picked this paper randomly and turned out to be a constant reorder love it!!!!!,5
B006P1EQXA,"Nice quality paper, i use for my bookmarks with bible verse, a beautiful promise of Jesus to all. I made invitation, sharing Jesus Words to all.",5
B006P1EQXA,I got it since it said it was 110lbs but its supper thin not what i needed for my projects and dont have time to return.,3
B006P1EQXA,just what I ordered,5
B006P1EQXA,"your description is confusing...NOTE: Providing sturdy and strong results, this 110 lb. index cardstock is heavier than standard 65 lb. cardstock, yet lighter than 80 lb. cover stock.Nice cardstock, would buy again!",5
B006P1EQXA,I ordered three and all were ripped when they arrived. The box they arrived in was fine and not damaged.  I'm a card maker so the corners of the paper are very important to me. Would not buy this again.,2
B006P1EQXA,We used this for our sons first birthday invitation and they came out great and saved a lot of money compared to buying online,5
B006P1EQXA,I have gone through several packages of this paper. I have a Hallmark card creator software and this paper is the perfect weight for making cards. I will order more!,5
B006P1EQXA,"I inspect building exteriors for a living, often in very windy conditions, so I use this instead of regular paper for my elevation drawings and notes on my clipboard. It helps a lot with wind resistance (although a wind-resistant clipboard is still necessary or at least strongly recommended, I managed with just this paper for a long time before I got around to getting one of those). It's very noticeably thicker and stiffer than normal paper. Not crazy thick, I'm not sure if I would consider this 'cardstock' but I'm no paper expert..It works fine in my Canon inkjet printer, even works fine with the auto-duplexer (automatically printing both sides), even though you're only supposed to use plain paper (I set the paper to normal). Come to think of it there may be a very occasional printer jam, perhaps one out of 100 sheets, at the most. Small price to pay for the convenience. I imagine if this where much thicker, it wouldn't work.I'm almost through my first ream, and ordered a second one, and I have no plans to use anything different.[Amazon shipping sometimes leaves something to be desired, they need to treat printer paper different than other items as far as packaging, but that has nothing to do with the product itself. My latest shipment arrived with the paper wrapper slightly torn, but fortunately the paper inside is fine.]",5
B006P1EQXA,"I use this card stock for posters and flyers. I was getting low in my stock, so I ordered more. I use the  paper often.110 pound works well and it prints OK on my printer.",5
B006P1EQXA,good and nice paper for the price,5
B006P1EQXA,"This is very thin, similar to 67 lb cardstock. Now I notice they do mention that, way at the bottom of a long description.",2
B006P1EQXA,"The paper itself is great, sturdy and clean. However, mine always come bent in corners with ripped packaging. If they changed the packaging, or even shipped it in a box, it would be perfect. However, there are always some damaged papers with their current packaging and shipping. Great for toddler crafts.",3
B006P1EQXA,"This not true 100lb card stock, its more like 65-80lb card stock",2
B006P1EQXA,"I use a lot of 65 lb. card stock, and this paper is labeled 110 lb. and is about the same thickness and weight per sheet. Still a good price, but misleading nonetheless.",2
B006P1EQXA,Use for copying pieces of music from books. Strong enough to stand up on music stand.,5
B006P1EQXA,"This paper is good quality given that it is 110# Index Weight.  To help you understand the differences between the different weight scales, I've included a conversion chart that is very helpful.  I usually buy 24# Bond Weight paper (90 grams per square meter) for daily printing use.  This cardstock product is 110# Index Weight paper (199 grams per square meter) and is roughly twice the weight and thickness of my daily printer paper.  It is a moderately thick cardstock.  If you want a thicker and stiffer cardstock, you'll want to get one with higher weight.  I would recommend getting 110# Cover Weight paper (297 grams per square meter) that is roughly three times the weight and thickness of my daily printing paper.  It would be useful if all the paper vendors included a weight conversion chart in their product listing to clarify the differences.",4
B006P1EQXA,"I ran out of this weight and brightness cardstock paper and was desperate to match it with a printing I'm doing. I was really happy this paper matches what I needed exactly, plus I have extra now. Great paper and came wrapped pretty well., not damaged. I'd buy again.",5
B006P1EQXA,Excellent paper,5
B006P1EQXA,This is not as bright as I would have liked. But I use all types of mediums to color with. Some things bleed thru but that's with a sharpie type marker. I've used other types of cardstock and sharpies and other markers streak. This covers the paper evenly and is just the right amount of thickness. Almost had a yellow tint to it.,5
B006P1EQXA,"I normally get 80 Lb paper from Hobby Lobby, but we moved so now I can't get it there. I wanted slightly thicker paper, so I bought this 110 Lb ream of paper for just a few $$ more. What a deal! Lol you get what you pay for. This feels more like 50 Lb. NO WAY it is 110. The listing says 110 Lb, but on the sticker of the wrapper on the product it says 110 (199g/m2). Maybe I misunderstood something and that label will clarify for other users, but don't buy this thinking you're getting a nice thick paper. It's barely cardstock.",1
B006P1EQXA,Waaay to thin for 110lbs. This is more like 80 lbs.  I have one from Michaels that is 65lb and feels almost the same. Very dissapointed.,3
B006P1EQXA,Love this card stock paper. Goes through my Epson printer and I love to take notes on it. Also cut up for my lists that I make daily. Love that Amazon carries it.,5
B006P1EQXA,great product but the ream packaging is always torn -so I have to check to make sure all the edges are ok.  One of the reams was on a angle in the box - with insufficient packaging. Time to find another vendor,2
B006P1EQXA,"I was disappointed in the paper thickness, (110 Lb.) as I was expecting it to be heavy cover stock, and instead it was lighter then the 80 Lb. paper I ordered at the same time.  I compared this paper to my other stock of the same weight, and there was a considerable difference in the weight.  The over all quality of the paper was OK, but it just was NOT what the label suggested.  I can not use it as my card base, it is too flimsy.  I have since found out that you must be aware of not only the 110 pound index (as listed in the ad), but also the numbers following that 110, for that tells you the thickness.  It is listed at 199 g/m, where the 80 lb. Coverstock is listed at 216 g/m.  I talked to a Representative at Neenah, and they helped me to understand the differences.",3
B006P1EQXA,I received this 8.5 x11 printer paper product,3
B006P1EQXA,"Good quality card stock and shipping was on time, I would not be writing a review of this it wasn't for the state of the state of the wrapping on the paper.  I use it over the corse of a year at home.  If this were ripped out of the packaging and placed in a printer, then there wouldn't have been much of an issue, but it sits in the yellow wrapping and is used a few pieces at a time.When the package was received the outside was in good shape, however, the yellow paper wrapping the card stock paper was ripped at both ends.  I had to tape one end and am unsure if all the pieces are actually there, and I won't be taking the time to count them.",4
B006P1EQXA,"This paper will be used for handmade cards and other paper crafted items.  The store where I normally purchase my paper was closed, so I bought this instead, as I am taking advantage of this stay at home time to stock up on items to sell in fall.  This paper is described as being the same weight as what I purchase from the store, however I was disappointed to discover that it is not the same weight - this paper is definitely thinner.  It will work fine for my paper crafting projects, but I wanted to let potential buyers know that it does not compare in weight to the 110# paper I normally purchase.  If you aren't overly concerned about the thickness, this is nice, quality paper and you can't beat the price.",4
B006P1EQXA,I bought this 110lb cardstock to see how it would match up against the 100lb cardstock that I use to make calendars. It's no where near as thick or heavy. In fact 12 sheets were a full 2 oz lighter than the 100lb Hammermill cardstock I use. This will be going back to the seller for a refund. Buyer Beware.,1
B006P1EQXA,"Edit 2015: Note that the product description does now include the fact that this is 199 gsm (110 lb) or 163 gsm (90 lb). Always compare 'gsm', not 'lb' weights to avoid being tripped up by the many classification systems which all assign different pound numbers.Additionally, several product pages have been condensed to a single page, causing my reviews for both weights to appear here.Original Review:Historically, product sold as 'card' stock is measured by 'cover' weight, not 'index' weight.  Both are weights of 500 sheets, but the sheets are different sizes - index is larger.If this was properly labeled, it would have reported that it is only 199 g/m^2.  I was expecting it to be fully 50% heavier, 297 g/m^2.  If this was measured by the same scale that e.g.  Wausau Paper Card Stock, 96 Brightness, 65 lb, Letter, Bright White, 250 Sheets per Pack (91904)        is measured by, it would only be 74 lb, not 110 lb.Amazon should list the g/m^2 weights for the paper and card stock it sells, since there's no way with that measurement to hide what amount of paper you're actually weighing.",3
B006P1EQXA,"First of all, the package came ripped and some sheets were damaged. Still debating if I want to raise a stink about that or not....And I may do just that because these also aren't as thick as I would like. At first I thought....""mmmmm these are nice"" (I literally thought that). However then I noticed that it was 2 sheets stuck together. So, technically they're about half as thick as I would have thought and what I was expecting.These are fairly flimsy. I was planning to use them for cutting out product boxes on the silhouette, however now I'm thinking that would make a fairly flimsy box.I may look into cutting out bags instead and if I can find a decent design, I may keep them. Otherwise they're going back.",3
B006P1EQXA,"On researching 110 lbs Card Stock I had two options among others 1) Wausau Paper Index Card Stock, 92 Brightness, 110 lb, Letter, White, 250 Sheets per Pack(49411) Sold by: MyOfficeInnovations for $8.71 OR 2) Neenah Exact Index Card Stock, 250 Sheets, White, 94 Brightness, 110 lb, 8.5 x 11 Inches Sold by: Amazon.com LLC for $11.99. Except for brightness they were the same. So I ordered one of each.1) The Paper Index Card Stock, 92 Brightness, 110 sold by: MyOfficeInnovations I noticed the following. As other reviewers commented that this is thinner than 110 lb paper. Also as others commented the outer shipping package was intact but the Paper packaging was ripped open and about 10% of paper side was bent, I can not use the bent paper so they go to waste. Over all it is a negative experience and will not purchase such an item again.2) The Neenah Exact Index Card sold by Amazon was well packaged, sheets intact not damaged and the thickness feels better. Overall this is a better product, service and worth the extra $3.28. I will purchase the Neenah Exact Index Card sold by Amazon in the future.",5
B006P1EQXA,"This is 110 pound paper and it works great for me when making greeting cards. The paper is clear, bright and smooth. I use this all the time and will buy again",5
B006P1EQXA,This is not as heavy as I expected. Had to go to Staples to get what I needed.,2
B006P1EQXA,"Bought this off of a recommendation from a YouTube video (can't remember which one), and glad I did! Great quality, clear white, very sturdy, great for making cards!",5
B006P1EQXA,"This paper will be used mostly for recipe cards. While it will work, it's not as thick as I wanted. (It's thickness is similar to index cards.)",4
B006P1EQXA,I was so disappointed in the weight.  I make cards and I just took it for granted that the weight was correct and cut my first dozen and painted ... well the weight is NOT correct and these hand painted cards will need to be repainted and I am now OUT of paper and not pleased with the incorrect product .. so sad and frustrated,1
B006P1EQXA,"Description given by seller is false, this is not at all 110 lb paper.  I didn't notice it is ""non-returnable"" until I attempted to return the probably 50 or 60 lb paper and cannot.  It's fine paper for toddlers to color on, or to make paper airplanes with, it is not 110 lb as stated in false description.",1
B006P1EQXA,"I have routinely bought cardstock for years from Staples or Walmart for a monthly poster I do for our arts council gallery window. I have not paid much attention to numbers - figured white cardstock is white cardstock.  I print on it with an inkjet printer, cut it up, paste it to foamboard.  Darn Staples closed and sometimes Walmart has what I need, sometimes not, did NOT feel like going tomorrow so ordered this.  It will work but it is somewhat flimsier than what I am used to ordering. It is Marie and has enough body to work but would not work for a standalone project where it would need to have enough stiffness to stand up without support.",4
B006P1EQXA,"The paper was nice but if you are looking for a thick card stock paper, this is not what you want. I compared it to some 110lb card stock that I had and it was about half the thickness.  The color was a nice bright white and the paper was very smooth just not the thickness that it was supposed to be.",2
B006P1EQXA,"I LOVE this card stock for card making and die cutting.  I ordered a CASE (10 reams) of this for a large project I'm in the middle of, and got it in two packages (one with 6reams ) and another with 4.  EVERY PACKAGE WAS RIPPED ON ALL SIDES; NONE WERE UNDAMAGED as far as the package cover itself went.  When broken from a REAM CASE and shipped in a larger box with another skinny item to shift around, damage will be done.  BAD YOU AMAZON for POOR PACKAGING!!!  The first 20-30 sheets in the first ream I opened are dog-eared and certainly can't be used for cards.  Those 20-30 sheets COST ME a LOSS of 40-60 CARDS!!!  Not happy about that.  Those will only be good for die cutting and smaller note cards at this point.  I don't know WHY ALL the REAMS would be ripped on all sides so badly that the paper would be ready to fall out of its package, but it certainly is and should be unacceptable.  HOPE YOU CHECK WITH SHIPPING going forward on this product to see what the devil they do with it before it goes out the door!!",3
B006P1EQXA,"This paper is NOT 110lb cover. It's a bit thinner than 65lb cover. The label does indicate it's measured by INDEX weight. (I made the mistake of assuming it was thick 110lb bond weight cover paper) Having said all that, the paper arrived in good condition. It's not BRIGHT white... has a bit of a grayish hue to it, but you wouldn't know it unless you compared it to a bright white.",4
B006P1EQXA,Good quality. Good price. Works well for color printing classroom games.,5
B006P1EQXA,Very thin. Title says 110lb but product description says 90lb. It's a very thin cardstock.,3
B006P1EQXA,My HP 5540 Envy printer needed to be revived after months of use. At first I resorted to printing in tricolor because the black cartridge wasn't responding.  The results were extremely disappointing and muddy and I honestly wouldn't have known if this matte paper with slight thickness had contributed to the poor quality.  I was so relieved to get my printer back up and running and the results were once again frame-worthy using this matte paper.  This paper seems to be perfect for using in a paper tray and printing 5 x7 photos and possibly larger.  So far so good...,4
B006P1EQXA,Excellent material great quality.,5
B006P1EQXA,"The paper is great-- heavy and looks wonderful. But, my package came ripped open with bends in the corners and holes along the sides. I pay for good paper for a reason. Not to throw out a quarter of the package for damage",4
B006P1EQXA,"When I opened the packing box, the paper wrapping around the stack of card stock was almost torn clear off and didn't hold the card stock together at all.",1
B006P1EQXA,box was very damaged and the package inside was torn up and the card stock was dirty and slightly bent can't be used and it is not refundable or returnable.,1
B006P1EQXA,"The package was ripped open so unless I count the sheets who knows if all 500 are present. Also, this is supposed to be 110 lb but feels like printer paper. Will be returning.",1
B006P1EQXA,"it arrived in a box with another item from Amazon fulfillment. Outer paper wrap was slightly torn and open..but stock inside was not damaged. this is a 110# Text weight..not 110# Cover weight.  being in the Design and Printing business i know the difference, but it worked for my project_ I designed and printed my own ""tags"" for Ducking Jeeps. so I want to point out that its not an 80# cover weight which is industry standard for professional business cards to be printed on, but it was thick enough for my ""tags"" which i laminated them, making the tags more rigid and waterproof.I ran it through my HP Inkjet printer and it prints crisp and vibrant color. im very pleased.",5
B006P1EQXA,"I ordered this paper because it says it's 110 lbs. I have a teem of 110 lbs black cardstock and it is much, much harder and thicker that this one. This one is actually exactly the same as the 60 lbs paper I have at home.I wasted my money.",2
B006P1EQXA,better price than what is in stores,5
B006P1EQXA,"It's no wonder this item is nonreturnable.  It is falsely described as 110  lb but in reality is more like 65 lb, if that.  This is an example of you get what you pay for.",1
B006P1EQXA,"I knew this paper was going to be thin after reading reviews and it was just what I needed! I need flexible and thin cardstock paper and this was the perfect weight. I agree that those looking for truly 110 lb paper will not be getting that with this paper. The paper arrived slightly damaged in the corner, but it was minimal and didn't affect the project I needed these for so it was still usable.",4
B006P1EQXA,Title says 110 lb but this is not. Buried deep in the detail description it says it is between 65 - 80 lb.TOTALLY MISLEADING  and WRONG - by the title and immediate description.,1
B006P1EQXA,"This is very much a 65lb stock, and not 110lb as advertised.  It is flimsy, cheap and bends easily.  My regular supplier was out so I grabbed this one not reading the reviews and now I am stuck with it as it is not returnable.  Its garbage if you need seriously thick cardstock.  This is absolutely not it!",1
B006P1EQXA,"If you make cards, this is a great paper for layers! It is 110 lb *index* which is not the same as and is much thinner than 110 lb *cover*. I'd say it might be equal to 65lb cardstock, maybe thinner. It is NOT sturdy enough for a card base. It is NOT anywhere close the same thickness as the 110 lb Neenah Classic Crest cardstock. If you are looking for a thick, sturdy cardstock, this is not what you want.This stock cuts very well in the Silhouette Cameo and its smooth texture is great for stamping. Alchohol markers bleed through though, just a heads up. It prints well in my laser printer, it's thin enough to not jam.At $9 for 250 sheets, this is a fantastic buy!!",5
B006P1EQXA,"I love this paper and is great for my lower-end business cards. However, you have to realize a big thing about lb ratings! There are two types:- index/text- coverHere's a basic conversion technique:1lb of Text paper = 1.48 gsm so you just multiply each pound of paper by 1.48.1lb of Cover paper = 2.708 gsm so multiply each pound of cover paper by 2.708If you know what you're looking for, this is a great choice. But keep that in mind, and that's the reason why a lot of the time two paperweights are the same/similar yet vary in price so much.",5
B006P1EQXA,This is not 110 lb card stock. I have 67 lb cardstock that is thicker.,2
B006P1EQXA,"I like this brand of cardstock, however, the paper is NOT the weight that it purports to be! I thought I looked fairly closely to make sure I was getting the right weight. But no matter what I did, I got the same exact weight that I buy in smaller packs at another big retailer. The weight is alright since that's what I use, but I expected more for the cost Involved. I recommend cardstock to use with alcohol markers as they deal with the ink better.",4
B006P1EQXA,Paper wrapping on the rwam was torn in multiple places.,4
B07H415XCM,"Great price, good quality.  For what you pay, this is well worth buying.  I am a high school science teacher, and these work well for what I need.",5
B07H415XCM,"Perfect for back to school. Affordable, easy to use  and quality was great. Super easy to clean any mistakes made. Durable and appearance was made good.",5
B07H415XCM,"I finally had a reason to use these glue sticks and was very pleased with their quality for such a reasonable price! I have some peel and stick closure envelopes that need a little help to stay closed for mailing and the glue stick was very helpful. The cap on the glue stick was a bit difficult for me to open but, once opened, the results were great! I have used glue sticks in the past without the purple color and it was tough to see where I had glued. These sticks solved that issue beautifully!",4
B07H415XCM,Great glue stick works as it should and great price for all the glue,5
B07H415XCM,Not sure why I bought 30 glue sticks but I did and now I need to keep 3 and give the other 27 to my grand kids class room. But overall they work great and are really low priced.,5
B07H415XCM,"It was during the time last year when parents were taking children to all sorts of stores for school supplies, and I didn't have to be milling about amongst them for this product!  My husband uses this for projects; he finds it easy, and comfortable to use as it doesn't get on his clothes or make a mess on his hands.",5
B07H415XCM,Was a good price.  Had so many I gave each of my grandkids a few sticks with plenty left for my 3d printing plates.,5
B07H415XCM,So cute,5
B07H415XCM,"works just as good as brand names, good quality",5
B07H415XCM,Muy bien.,5
B07H415XCM,"Dries clear, safe for various surfaces, and easy to clean.",5
B07H415XCM,I love when I find Amazon products that are actually truly reasonably priced. I don't know if I could say they work as well as the original Elmers brand but they get the job done and cost a fraction of the namebrand stuff. I had a quick project I had to use glue sticks for and probably won't need to use them again for a long time so having it at a cheap price really helped me out,4
B07H415XCM,Son exactamente como se describen. La barra es morada pero al secarse el pegamento se torna transparente. Tiene buen poder de adherencia,5
B07H415XCM,"Me encanto, muy original y de buena calidad",5
B07H415XCM,Easy to use,5
B07H415XCM,This is a great four a teacher for a classroom gift for home school.,5
B07H415XCM,I bought the 30 pk and now I can afford to have at least one glue stick per room for kids to do their crafts etc. This is great value for the money. I don't observe a difference between this Amazon brand and other name brand from quality perspective. Highly recommended for casual craft works.,5
B07H415XCM,Pega excelente y por el precio 10/10,5
B07H415XCM,"Bought 10 of these for a kindergarten teacher in an underprivileged school. They never have adequate supplies and for the kids to start the year with fresh glue sticks was a real treat. Bought during the back-to-school sale, so price was right and prime shipping was free!",5
B07H415XCM,"Arrived on time, not dried out",5
B07H415XCM,Excelente producto.,5
B07H415XCM,Cheap great classroom alternative to Elmers glue!,5
B07H415XCM,"I bought these glue sticks because they were on sale during back-to-school time.  They have become my preferred glue stick for scrapbooking.  These glue sticks are odor-less.  They have just the right amount of stickiness/ tackiness to them.  It dries quick, but not too quick.  I like the purple color so you can see what you have glued and it dries clear.",5
B07H415XCM,These worked very well.Same quality as the big brands without a famous brand name.,5
B07H415XCM,"Fast shipping, great product, I highly recommend!",5
B07H415XCM,Good quality glue,5
B07H415XCM,Great for the school classroom,5
B07H415XCM,Perfect for what I needed,5
B07H415XCM,I use these on mu build plate and my prints come out great and easy to clean off.,5
B07H415XCM,es un producto que no hay mucho que decir pero cumple con lo que ofrece,5
B07H415XCM,I tried other clear glue sticks but none of them work for my application (3D printing).  The others were either too gooey or dried too fast upon heating.  The Amazon ones are perfect in property as the Elmer's.,5
B07H415XCM,Cool,5
B07H415XCM,Muy bueno,5
B07H415XCM,It works great for my granddaughters art projects. I like that it dries clear. Easy to use too. Will be buying again,5
B07H415XCM,"Ordered 3 packages of these gluesticks when each was $0.25 before I went back to college and wasn't sure if I'd need them or not. I did end up using all of them, and they are perfect! Very comparable to Elmer's or any store brand like Walmart or Target. Easy to use and lasts for a decent amount of time! Perfect for all ages and uses! Highly recommend stocking up on these during Amazon's back-to-school sale!",5
B07H415XCM,Like it just as much as Elmer's,5
B07H415XCM,"Every parent knows the importance of having quality stationery supplies on hand for their children's school projects. This time, we will talk about purple glue. You know how kids are; they are always gluing something at school.In the end, I decided to try the glue sticks from Amazon Basics. As for the adhesive properties of this product, they are great. I mean, they are not worse or better than any other glue. However, the main feature of this glue stick is that it is not just white or clear but purple. This way, my son can see where he applied the glue, how much he used, and can stick everything exactly where it needs to go.Overall, I recommend it.",5
B07H415XCM,Just like it says. These are the best for the job. The repositioning window is shorter than the other big brand so you do need to plan a little more but the coverage and stick are superior. 900x better than the $1.25tree if you're considering your value options.,5
B07H415XCM,Works fantastic on my K1Max plate A PEI smooth plate. Cleans very easy too.,5
B07H415XCM,"Pegan muy bien, muy buen producto",5
B07H415XCM,"I picked this up for a project for the kiddos, wanted every person to be able to have their own glue stick handy, and these worked like a charm.  Adhesive held, sticks were easy to work with, and we had minimal mess to clean up when we were done.",4
B07H415XCM,Can't go wrong with these glue sticks for twenty cents!!!!!,5
B07H415XCM,"Goes on fine, dries clear.But it does *not* hold for very long at all. The papers I glued together were coming apart after a short time. Second and third passes of glue had same results",3
B07H415XCM,You really cant argue how cheap these are for how many you get :),5
B07H415XCM,Ordered this for the kids for school. Some glues really dried out too quick or don't have much in them for the price...This glue does what it says it will do for the kids school work and crafting and holds up well. Easily cleans up. Sturdy little containers. No ugly streaks and dries clear.This is an essential we have on autoship during school months,5
B07H415XCM,"It's good for the price but it's not very strong. Easy to clean. It dries clear. Easy to apply because of the stick applicator. It's washable so it's easy to remove. I wouldn't use it for heavy cardboard, just printer or construction paper.",3
B07H415XCM,It's glue. It works.,5
B07H415XCM,The glue applies smooth and not sticky or stringy. Dries VERY Fast.  You have to be ready or you'll be reapplying for adhesion.,4
B07H415XCM,Dry out quicker than most,4
B07H415XCM,It was cheap and works like it should.,5
B07H415XCM,stick ok,4
B07H415XCM,Sticky,5
B07H415XCM,Pega muy bien,5
B07H415XCM,It works great,4
B07H415XCM,We do a lot of arts and crafts in my house with toddlers and these glue sticks are great and are purple that dries clear just like their name brand counterpart. Will buy again.,5
B07H415XCM,Great price for two glue sticks. Works just as good as any other ones and they're affordable!!,4
B07H415XCM,"Great deal, cheap, fast delivery",4
B07H415XCM,Its just glue- sun tzu.,5
B07H415XCM,I use this for my 3D printer and it glides nice and smoothly on the build plate. These are an excellent price and I purchased some for my nieces and nephews to use for school. It is a good size for their backpacks.,5
B07H415XCM,Works as well as other name brands.,5
B07H415XCM,you get your moneys worth they seal nicely and the glue strength is well,5
B07H415XCM,Great price and works great too!,5
B07H415XCM,Real good school type glue. I use this on a 3d printer to enhance stickability and it works well.,5
B07H415XCM,Sticks paper products. Easy to clean kids hands after use,5
B07H415XCM,"I got this for kids since sometimes they need glue for their projects and so far, this glue is good for them.",5
B07H415XCM,"I purchased this because it was cheaper than the glue sticks I had been using for 3D printing bed adhesion.  Unfortunately it does not seem to do well for this application.  The issues I encountered were:1. Application on a clean print plate did not offer good adhesion compared to other products.2. The glue seems to be much ""softer"" than other glue sticks I have been using which leads to lumps and thick areas on the bed plate.3. The glue stick is much narrower than standard glue sticks.  This is probably one of the reasons for issue #2.It seemed to work ok as a ""touch up"" application on a bed plate that was prepared with a different glue stick and I was just ensuring that there was good bed coverage after removing a print.I would recommend this product for 3D printing https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B8PVSJG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  I haven't had any issues using it.Summary: Might work for arts & crafts and gluing paper, but look elsewhere for 3D printing.",2
B07H415XCM,"El producto se utiliza para trabajos escolares, es muy bueno, lo recomiendo",5
B07H415XCM,My children and I are pleased with them. Works just the same as the more known brand for a better price,5
B07H415XCM,Sirve muy bien,5
B07H415XCM,"Handy to have these for my craft projects. I like that it goes on purple so you can see where you have placed it, but then it dries clear. Holds very well. A great value for the price!",5
B07H415XCM,Adhesive quality is equivalent to name brand. Using it over time I've noticed with my classroom it works as well as name brand except way less expensive.,5
B07H415XCM,"I pick up several of these for work (teacher), and these are great and inexpensive. Serves the purpose and I am able to stock up on a fair amount for little money.",5
B07H415XCM,works great on the 3d printer bed.,5
B07H415XCM,Glue stick works perfectly.,5
B07H415XCM,"My daughter's school is one of those schools with the long list supplies. Last year, I believe I spent over $100 in supplies. Folders, markers, etc. This yr I'm budgeting better and there not a need for everything to be name brand. Long as the product gets the job done, then it's fine. This is a quality product.",5
B07FCNW3JK,"This Champaca essential oil smells soooo amazing, like your in a tropical forest full of wild magnolia flowers, truly Scent ecstasy ! 10/10 will be buying gya labs essential oils for now for my hair oil business!",5
B07FCNW3JK,Been having trouble finding some essential oils locally so took to Amazon to grab some. One scent I had just hunted down and found from NOW brands was cedarwood so I bought a few Gya Labs scents plus another cedarwood to compare to the one I already had. Today I got the cedarwood and immediately after opening I noticed it smelled nothing like like the NOW brand cedarwood which was by far more potent and soothing. The Gya Labs cedarwood was weak and even unpleasant if I smelled it for long enough... Unlike the NOW brand cedarwood... this one smells weak and even offputing if you smell it for long enough. Also theres nothing on the bottle that explicitly states its100% Pure Cedarwoord as most brands confident in their quality would have. Sorry but I cannot recommend :(,3
B07FCNW3JK,"I used this on an aroma pad as a car freshener. It gives off scent for about an hour, but since it is citrus and a natural oil, the scent doesn't last long. The smell was decent and I had no problems with the product. However, you might be better off ordering from a more trusted brand (like Plant Therapy) if quality testing is important to you.",4

B07FCNW3JK,"Didn't like the scent I picked out, but the customer service was amazing and made it right, right away. I will continue to be a life long customer of this company.",4
B07FCNW3JK,"Beautiful, strong scent. I added this to a bigger bottle of almond oil and it smells wonderful! Good quality!",5
B07FCNW3JK,Girls get your patchouli oil now. The 4 stars is because I wanted the size to be a bigger.,4
B07FCNW3JK,"I absolutely LOVE this brand! It was love at first smell! I was trying to find some oils to use in products for my small business. And saw that this brand had over 150,000 reviews so I figured I would try it and I am definitely a forever customer now! Will keep buying this!",5
B07FCNW3JK,A little bit goes a long way. Has my house smelling so good. I mixed it with vanilla.,5
B07FCNW3JK,"I have been using this product for two years. It is slowly replacing the collagen on my face it also is slowly filling in my turkey net. I use this wis my everyday lotion on my face neck. The results are slow and steady this is not a quick fix. So far, with the occasional cerve vitamin C serum, with the above products. Amazon has all of the products and they are 5 stars to me.",5
B07FCNW3JK,"Smells very nice not oily so it works well with being brushed through your Hair. I put it on a Cottonball which I put in a small, vented Jar that I keep by my computer.",5
B07FCNW3JK,I got chills when I smelt this fine oil. It was the oil that the woman used a years wedges to buy to anoint Jesus before his death. I own a business making growth beard/hair oils and products all natural with many different oils. This is my favorite of all time. Incredible for skin too.,5
B07FCNW3JK,Very pure oil mixed with another carrier oil for body application.  Pleasant scent.,5

B07FCNW3JK,"Used for years . Very light, nice scent",5
B07FCNW3JK,Good product and seller. The scent was more like a cleaning product like Pine Sol but much more pleasant and not strong like Pine Sol.,4
B07FCNW3JK,"This is very affordable and the scent is strong (I use in a diffuser), however, I do find the scent overly sweet and more sugary than vanilla. To me it smells like fruity pebbles cereal. I use it in diffuser mixes along with other fragrances to add a bit of sweetness, but I don't really use it like I would use a vanilla scent.",4
B07FCNW3JK,I love the smell of it is put it three to four times a day I highly recommend it. I am going to order another one this Friday.,5

B07FCNW3JK,"I use this in a variety of homemade things, face serums, body scrubs. It is very good for your skin.",5
B07FCNW3JK,This is a great little bottel with a nice glass dropper - much easier to use than some bottles i've gotten that have a plastic thing inserted in the top.  Large bottle which will last a long time for a great price!,5

B07FCNW3JK,I purchased to combine with other products and apply to my face. My skin is softer and smoother.,5

The jar of roman chamomile was 2/3 full and the box was soaked in oil.  The seal is still intact as you see in the photos and the video.  The quality of the oil is wonderful and exactly what I needed for making lotions.  I decided to buy a second jar and this happened.  This may have been from handling during delivery.I reached out to their support line early in the day.  Initially I received a bounced back email HOWEVER the email did actually go through and the support team responded several hours later.  The problem was resolved quickly and they mentioned looking into making sure it would not happen again. l will certainly continie purchasing their quality oil when I need more!,4
B07FCNW3JK,Smells just like vanilla. Will be using this brand for all my vanilla ingredients for my crafts. Almost smells like tropical vanilla.,5
B07FCNW3JK,Waiting to see if works,5
B07FCNW3JK,"usually other essential oils give me a headacke, they either smell super strong or the scent doesn't last very long. I feel safe and confident when using Gya labs essential oils.",5

B07FCNW3JK,"Been having very bad gum pain. Put a little of this on my toothbrush with my toothpaste, and it alleviates the pain. You must know though that this is very strong oil. Do not use it alone. Mix it with toothpaste or something else, but it is an excellent product and I recommended highly.",5

B07FCNW3JK,This is my favorite brand of essential oils when it comes to the sweet orange and the patchouli scent are both out of this world!! And the smallest amount of their oils will last and smell forever compared to some that lose their scent within the first hour,5
B07FCNW3JK,I've been very happy with my purchase and the quality of this tea tree oil. I will purchase again.,5
B07FCNW3JK,"This bottle did not smell like Spruce, as labeled. It had a minty fragrance. It wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.",4
B07FCNW3JK,I use this for making my own body lotion. Just a few drops and I get that delicious vanilla scent. I will buy it again when it is over.,5

B07FCNW3JK,Fabulous oil used for diffuser,5
B00006IFN9,"I bought them for my lefty boyfriend after he mentioned a disdain for regular scissors. I've never thought about it (as a privileged righty) but apparently the blades need to be swapped for lefties so that the scissors can visibly line up with edges.Anyway lefty boyfriend was SO excited about them and loved these scissors.They're a durable pair of scissors, they're sharp, they're ergonomically designed for the shape of the left hand, and $9 is well worth the joy these scissors bring to lefty folk",5
B00006IFN9,5 stars for these all purpose scissors! This brand is known for its quality and durability!Great product !,5
B00006IFN9,I love these scissors. They hold an edge for a very long time and always reliable. I've had these almost a year and use them in my classroom for all kinds of projects when I prep for lessons or anything.,5
B00006IFN9,Perfect! Sharp and heavy duty!,5
B00006IFN9,"I had an earlier set of Fiskers so-called Left-handed scissors.  In reality the old pair were a right-handed scissor mechanism with left-handed handles.  That is, when holding the scissors to cut, the upper blade was on the right hand side, blocking my view of where I am cutting.  In order to see my cut line I had to put the scissors on the right hand side of my body, holding it awkwardly with my left hand.  Thanks, Fiskars!  You made a pair of scissors a righty can't hold, and a lefty can't cut with.This current model, on the other hand, actually reverses the blades so the upper blade is on the left hand side and now I can hold and cut on the left side of my body and see where the cut line is.  This is so much more comfortable and natural to use!If you've got an older pair of lefty scissors make sure the upper blade is on the left side.  If it's not, order one of these scissors now -- you won't regret it!",5
B00006IFN9,"We bought a new pair, similar to what we previously bought at Walmart. Same brand but when they arrived it turns out that they were slightly smaller than our previous pair, but that is my mistake. Overall, they're great scissors and will likely buy a couple more since our scissors always seem to grow legs and walk away. They cut well and seem durable. We recommend.",4
B00006IFN9,Quality. Easy to find. Price is reasonable.,5
B00006IFN9,"My son mentioned that he has a difficult time using regular right handed scissors, so I bought these for him. He was delighted  with the scissors and they fit perfectly in his hand. They are excellent quality and we are delighted with the purchase.",5
B00006IFN9,"I ordered these Fiskars scissors because I was replacing a pair that had been used for several years. If one uses scissors for paper and other paper like items they will wear to the point that cutting fabric. vinyl, foam and other such items becomes hard and the final result is not a clean cut. So, I use these primarily for craft projects such as paper, cardboard and items that don't need precise cuts. I will continue to buy this brand of scissors for all my crafting needs.",5
B00006IFN9,It really works. I could not use right handed scissors no matter how many attempts to get it to cut.,5
B00006IFN9,"what do MECHONE, valencia/honeybelle/temple, and whiskers have in common?1. ""whiskers"" rhymes with FISKARS, the #1 scissor brand for quality and pricer2. vlencia/honeybelle/temple oranges are all the same color as the #1 scrissor company in the world3. MECHIONE* is the amazon  textbook seller, #1 in its category just like FISKARS - #1!* small, independent pro merchant since 2006 who exclusively uses FISKARS",5
B00006IFN9,Love Fiskars products.  Keep a pair of these scissors in the garage and had to have one for the home.,5
B00006IFN9,They cut paper and cloth without a problem.  I picked this brand because it's always had a good reputation.,5
B00006IFN9,Are slightly bigger than regular Fiskars. Not as comfortable to use.,4
B00006IFN9,First year I had one blade was slightly bent.  It was really hard to detect but affected the cut obviously I didn't like what I saw when I went on to the manufacturer's site Amazon stuck by me and help me with the new pair of scissors thank you Amazon,5
B00006IFN9,Very good,4
B00006IFN9,I have had a similar brand I've used for years and I was tired of sharpening them. I went on to check reviews and decided these were the best for me. I ordered many because I use them all over my house and want them nearby and handy. These are nice quality and fit my female hand just right.,5
B00006IFN9,"My wife is a quilter, and this was just what she wanted.",5

B00006IFN9,Best quality scissors in the world. Cut every time.,5
B00006IFN9,"My daughter (14) is left-handed, and it's harder to find left-handed scissors than you'd think. So I ordered this and it's strong. She now has the best scissors in the house!",5
B00006IFN9,"Fiskars scissors are reasonable priced, and they are reliable every time.",5
B00006IFN9,I needed left handed scissors and these scissors cut as intended. The handles are well made.,5
B00006IFN9,The only drawback to these sissors is the size of the finger hole:  it's a bit tight for three fingers on a man's hand (if you have BIG hands these are not for you.  Thumb hole is just right.,4
B00006IFN9,"Good scissors, really sharp",5
B00006IFN9,"I needed a real pair of fabric scissors with the intention of chopping my wedding dress for the reception. MISSION SUCCESS! I was picturing my mom's ""no kids allowed"" sewing scissors and these are exactly them! Down to the color. Worked great!",5
B00006IFN9,"My left-handed daughter said exactly that, upon first trying these scissors. My only regret is not buying them sooner. Many scissors say they can work for right or left handed, but my daughter says these are much better. The quality is great, they feel strong, not cheap or flimsy. My daughter has absolutely no complaints about her scissors. If you have a left handed person in your life, please get them these scissors. My daughter was so excited by how these worked in comparison to the others. While this pair wouldn't be appropriate for toddlers or young children....my 10 year old  uses these with no problem.",5
B00006IFN9,Haven't had a left-handed pair before but certainly appreciate how easy it is on my thumb.,5
B00006IFN9,65. Took me till I was 65 to finally get a pair of left handed scissors. Oh My Happiness. They are the greatest!,5
B00006IFN9,Great quality and sharpness finally.,5
B00006IFN9,"Fiskars makes great cutting tools  and these scissors are no exception.  They are sharp out of the box, as they should be,  the metal cutting blades are firm without bending or twisting while cutting.  Edges make a clean cut",5
B00006IFN9,"These are my go-to scissors for cutting fabric.  Great quality, size, design. They're sharp and stay sharp for a long time.",5
B00006IFN9,"They are big, the cut greatly and are very sharp",5
B00006IFN9,"I am actually right handed, but when I had an injury and had to use my left hand, these were great! (Fortunately my hand is back to normal.)",5
B00006IFN9,Work great. Feel high quality.,5
B00006IFN9,Just what I was looking for plus I like that brand!,5
B00006IFN9,I bought these to donate to a State Park and ended up keeping a couple of pair for myself. Reliably sharp and not very expensive -- I have used this brand for years.,4
B00006IFN9,These are very good scissors and they are quite sharp. I have never had lefty scissors before these so I am very happy with them and they are a good size for all adults. They are very durable and have been used for a while and are still sharp and look brand new!,5
B00006IFN9,"Why the heck would anyone need ""left-handed scissors""?  Well, there's a 90% chance you don't.But for the 10% of the population that is left-handed, it makes a big difference.I've attached some photos of trying to cut along a line using the ubiquitous right-handed scissors.  Holding the scissors in my right hand, I have a clear view of the line and can cut along it with ease.  Switching the scissors to my left however, causes my view of the line to be completely blocked by the upper blade.  In my right hand, the upper blade is on the other side of the line from my eyes; in my left, it is between my eyes and the line meaning I can't see it.So what's the big deal here?  With left-handed scissors, the blades are switched with the upper blade on the left, putting it on the other side of what you're cutting.Trust me, I had no idea there was a difference before I had a left-handed kid.  Then I started researching what lefties needed and learned about scissors (among other things).  Once I understood the issue, it became obvious that this was a necessity.Some scissors claim to be left- and right-handed but that just means that the handles are not slanted to fit the thumb and fingers more comfortably.  So, yes, they can be used by both lefties and righties but lefties still have to deal with the challenge of the blade position.  They really need true left-handed scissors.So if you're right-handed, forget about this and go on about your business in a world built for you.  If, however, you are a lefty or if you know someone who is, get a pair of these asap.Oh, and as scissors?  They're Fiskars.  They're good quality and they'll last.",5
B00006IFN9,These work well for cutting fabric!,5
B00006IFN9,Work great for this south paw. They are sharp and work extremely well so far. Have had them for a few months. Highly reccomend.,5
B00006IFN9,Gardening,5
B00006IFN9,"Being in the largest minority in the world (being left handed), it is so nice to find products made for us, and these Fiskar scissors are great.  Also, it's really funny to watch a ""rightie"" try and use them, since they are made backwards from what they are used to and they don't work.  Welcome to the left-handed world of things.",5
B00006IFN9,"The Fiskars brand is my all time favorite brand of scissors.  No matter what I may need to cut, it is almost always the brand I will intentionally seek out to use, even if another brand of scissors were sitting right in front of me just waiting to be used.  I purchased this pair of Original Orange Handled Fiskar scissors to supplement my old pair of truly Original Orange Handled Fiskar scissors, since they were purchased back in the late 1960's for home economics and sewing classes, when those subjects were still required education for the girls alone, while the boys took shop.  They have been used regularly since that time, and more recently have even substituted as box cutters and garden shears as well as household scissors.  While Fiskars has designed other styles of scissors meant for different purposes, I went with the same style of scissors I had, as I wanted scissors that I knew would cut fabric without any problem.  The old pair has a spot in the middle of the blade that has been damaged, so no longer perfectly cuts when I reach that spot.  However, everywhere else on the blade is still sharp, the handle shape is comfortable, and the scissor is lightweight.  The old pair still will slice right through paper, and you really do not even have to move the handle, but just push the blades against the paper to get a clean cut.  These are great scissors, and really I think every household should own a pair of them if they don't already.",5
B00006IFN9,"Super sturdy, super sharp perfect",5
B00006IFN9,"I got these a couple months ago to use for sewing. They cut through fabric easily and have not dulled even though I've used them for some time. Great durability and sharpness, and a great price!",5
B00006IFN9,I always hated using fisker scissors in the past as my fingers would always get stuck. Turns out I was just trying to use right handed scissors with my left hand. These work great and are so much easier to use. Very sharp and cuts well. I like that they are red while the right hand pair are orange so anyone using the craft room will easily be able to pick up the correct scissors.,5
B00006IFN9,"Sharpest, easy to use its scissors, Lets face it we have all been using them since kindergarten. But these are VERY SHARP.  Watch the kids",5
B00006IFN9,"I have a small hand and at first the scissors seemed to be too big and not easy to use. I usually do not need such a large scissor. I quickly got used to them, they do the job. They are sharp and cuts through what I need them to do. When you own one pair of scissors, too large is better than too small.",4
B00006IFN9,Nice quality scissors for left handed people. Size is just right,5
B00006IFN9,Not too heavy good for cutting fabric,5
B00006IFN9,Why go to the store when you can have the same product delivered by Amazon for the same price. The product has great functionality and a great value for the money. Very durable product and gets the job done.,5
B00006IFN9,Old school. These scissors are pretty good and they worked for cutting thick felt.,5
B00006IFN9,"Sharp and stry, durable",5
B00006IFN9,Would like them to be lighter and not require a full open grip to cut properly.,4
B00006IFN9,Could have spent more on other scissors.These work well. Very sharp.Good value.,4
B00006IFN9,My son is a lefty and since he started 5th grade we needed to upgrade his scissors. These work well for him,5
B00006IFN9,These are the best cutting scissors I've ever used.,5
B00006IFN9,You can't go wrong with this company's products.,5
B00006IFN9,Well made and very precise. The best.,5
B00006IFN9,My left handed daughter says these are fantastic scissors. Comfortable and well made. They'll last her a very long time. We didn't realize there were left handed scissors available. Wish we bought them sooner. Very sharp & sturdy plus got them at a great price. Hopefully they don't disappear at school.,5
B00006IFN9,"The blades of the scissor were bowed outward slightly so for most of the blade in the middle, the two blades don't make contact",3
B00006IFN9,They are well made and function well.,4
B00006IFN9,"Finally, some decent all around scissors! Sharp and ergonomic!",5
B00006IFN9,"Like others have said, these are stiff at first but wow are they sharp. I found if I opened and closed them a lot before using, and then worse a glove like I use for quilting, it did not irritate my hands. You have to have friction and pressure to achieve the cutting so naturally there will be pressure which can cause blisters on unprotected hands. I suspect after a lot of use they will loosen up. I tried rotary pinking blades and was unimpressed. I cut out my patterns with a rotary cutter and use these shears on areas which tend to fray. These cut 2-3 layers of quilting cotton easily.",5
B00006IFN9,His sister's work great.I love him.I got like 3 pairs of them all around the house.So I don't know how to go hunt for the,5
B00006IFN9,We've had so much trouble finding left handed scissors that would work. We finally found this pair and no other pair of scissors could compare! So comfortable and easy to use for left handed folks.,5
B00006IFN9,I Knew which pair to order - .,5
B00006IFN9,"They seem well made & work OK for the light cutting I've done so far.  As for comfort, that's going to depend on your hand size because the handles are severely contoured so they probably fit a medium size hand.  My hand is slightly larger than medium & these aren't a perfect fit for me.  If my hand was any larger they'd be uncomfortable.I'm 68 years old & have been using right-handed scissors my entire life. So I'm used to lining up my cuts along the left edge of the upper blade.  These line up with the right edge of the upper blade.  Believe it or not, it's a bigger adjustment than I'd expected.  So these will go in my kitchen where most of my cutting doesn't need to be precise & I'll eventually try using them when the need arises to cut a dense material that is painful to cut with right handed scissors.If I was designing scissors for left-handers, I'd make the grip less severely contoured, maybe using a material that had some compressive property, and I'd keep the blades the same as on right-handed scissors.  There may be some just like that on the market but I'd assumed any marketed to left-handers would be designed that way.  Now I know better.P.S. - the so called universal grip scissors that I've tried aren't terrible but still aren't very comfortable for cutting denser materials.",4
B00006IFN9,"Simple, comfortable and work very well. I used them on paper, thin plastic and fiberglass insulation and they are a dream.",5
B00006IFN9,By far the best scissors for the money.  Hard to beat.,5
B00006IFN9,"These very affordable scissors are terrific! I finally threw out all the others that I could never depend on and replaced them with this Fiskars pair.  Beside being fairly priced, they're durable,  sharp and widely serviceable.  Highly recommend them.",5
B00006IFN9,Needed to get a left handed scissors for my husband. It was difficult eeing his struggle in the kitchen when he tried to open something.,5
B00006IFN9,I have several pairs of these (and other brands) picked this one also because it was allegedly made in Vietnam.  (the item description also says made in USA?) The one I received was made in China.  Assume it will perform as advertised otherwise,4
B00006IFN9,"As with all Fishers products, this pair of shears works great for my intended purposes.  I would buy again.",5
B00006IFN9,As a lefty I've been looking for a good pair of scissors that felt naturally good in the hand. I found them in this pair! They arrived quickly and were as described by the manufacturer.,5
B00006IFN9,Aw the simple things,5
B00006IFN9,very sharp,5
B00006IFN9,When considering price and quality these are the best scissors you can buy in my opinion.They are razor sharp. Require little effort to cut normal objects and are easy on your hands. I have 3 pairs I like them that much.Highly recommend!,5
B00006IFN9,Got these for my Lefty husband. He said they were OK.,4
B00006IFN9,I love these pinking shears.  I now have two.  One for each area I sew in!,5
B00006IFN9,I purchased these scissors because I'm familiar with the brand and the cost is very reasonable for pinking shears.  I was a little concerned when I received the scissors as the plastic that covered the scissors had been opened.  This does seem to be a problem as the scissors are working well.,5
B00006IFN9,Cuts through fabric easily. Great for left handed,5
B07H4N8DL9,"Frankly, I was blown-away by how sturdily constructed these sheers were and how sharply they cut. You can hear the sound as they cut. Only a good pair of scissors can do that. They are styled beautifully, with good proportions and tasteful, but minimal color accents. The one adaptation I would have appreciated would be the opportunity to choose my colors, because color coordination means a lot to me. Nonetheless, I was able to approximately match the colors to the dominant colors in the given room. I really like to have a good pair of sheers in every room in my home, rather than go hunting for a single pair, so a package like this with multiple pairs is practical for someone like me. Well done, and a superb value for the price.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Love the size and colors! I gifted the other four to friends. Had one. Now I have two!,5
B07H4N8DL9,"Well made, sharp enough for household tasks, and with very nice padded grip for ease of use.",4
B07H4N8DL9,Great quality for the price. We use these Scissors in our Classes and they've held up fine. Love the colors too. Great option for teachers and for home because Scissors are like socks. IYKYK,5
B07H4N8DL9,I would recommend this to anyone who needs scissors. I purchased for my teachers at school and they loved them!,5
B07H4N8DL9,Handy having scissors in every room!,5
B07H4N8DL9,"Good quality, work well, came as described.",5
B07H4N8DL9,These are light but work perfectly on various types of fabrics. Very inexpensive and last a long time. They seem to be really well made.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"More than satisfied with this product.If I needed any more, I definitely would be ordering them again!!",5
B07H4N8DL9,Cheap quality.,4
B07H4N8DL9,"Don't expect them to do a lot of heavy duty cutting and don't buy them for material. They're good for paper. I always find myself needing to cut open some food package or deliveries, so I just needed something to do that. I tried using them to cut a bandage wrap off my dog, and No. Stinks at that. They're too flimsy for that and the blades separate easily. Don't pay a lot for them. I paid around $8. They aren't were more than that.",3
B07H4N8DL9,"For those of you who live in a home full of small humans who are frequently walking away with all the good scissors, you need these. They look like my nicer scissors, work great and yet for the price I can live with them walking away. I used to lose my mind if I walked in on my kids using the nice scissors to cut cardboard or paper or all the other weird things that kids do with scissors. Now I keep these scissors readily available for them so they stay away from the my scissors.Save your sanity and your scissors by keeping a bunch of these around for the kids.",4
B07H4N8DL9,"Received five in a pack which was good, placed one in each room in the house.  Good grip",4
B07H4N8DL9,"I'm so sick of not having a scissor handy so yeah I bought 25. The price is absolutely worth it. I've bought some others that feel thin & cheap. I cant say they're the hardiest (basic) scissor but they'll definitely do the job and then some. Yes I cut everything w them. At that price if I break one trying to cut metal, who cares",5
B07H4N8DL9,I like these scissors they cut well and if they get used to cutting something they shouldn't be used for it's fine.  I seem to always lose scissors it's nice having them in different places in my house.  Can beat the price.,4
B07H4N8DL9,I LOVE THEM,5
B07H4N8DL9,1 for each kids and parents and the price was good. Good product,4
B07H4N8DL9,Exactly what it looks like! Scissors for all because they seem to disappear... I haven't seen the purple ones since these arrived! Some things just don't change!!!!!,5
B07H4N8DL9,"we use scissors all the time in my house so having more than one is essential. This 5 pack is perfect, i never have to go looking for scissors anymore!!",5
B07H4N8DL9,"Awesome - finally have enough scissors!  And, they cut fine.",5
B07H4N8DL9,All good!,5
B07H4N8DL9,"Great buy for the price!  Smooth cut, doesn't hurt your hands and I like that the colors are different.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Perfect scissors for kiddos! Love the bright colors. OCC kiddos will love these! They seem sturdy & durable.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"I used them for a fiberglass project where I needed to cut craft paper, banner paper, plastic film, peel ply nylon fabric, light and heavy fiberglass both wet and dry.  Cheap enough that you can toss a pair that gets dull, but did the job needed.  They don't hold up to acitone, had to clean them by had after cutting wet fiberglass.  Epoxy peels off pretty easily.  They don't replace a pair of electric shears when cutting lots of 1708 fiberglass, but did great as utility scissors for everything else.",4
B07H4N8DL9,"I am pleasantly surprised by this multi pack of scissors. After tossing my dull-as-lint Dollar Store pair, I needed a reasonably priced pair to suffer the indignities of garage tasks: opening bark bags, decapitating caulk tubes. These scissors cut like light sabers! Love them! For the first time ever, I have scissors everywhere I might possibly need one!",5
B07H4N8DL9,Ordered for Vacation Bible School for the older kids since they were pointed on the ends.  Was surprised that they were sharp.  They cut through felt very well.,5
B07H4N8DL9,Loved the quality for the great price.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"I just wanted good basic scissors to have around the house. Put one in every room. They are comfortable and easy to hold and use. They come sharp so far, no issues. Quality seems fine. Great to just have backups around the house and office.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Loose sharp sisors. I hope the trash man doesn't get cut. Can not be adjusted. I will close them with  rubber band and toss them away. The other sisors seem to be fine,2
B07H4N8DL9,Great value pack! Smooth cutting,5
B07H4N8DL9,"i thought, for the price, that these scissors would be so-so. they actually are good, sharp scissors and i would buy them again.",5
B07H4N8DL9,"Useful, durable, leave them around the house so there's always scissors nearby.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Not only sharp but stay sharp after many many uses. Ergonomically easy on your hand,5
B07H4N8DL9,Always need them,5
B07H4N8DL9,these are basically disposable. good for a few weeks then trash,4
B07H4N8DL9,"We lose sissors all the time and loved this 5 pack!  This is the second pack I bought as others have ""borrowed"" them.  Sturdy and hold up well!",5
B07H4N8DL9,"These work for basic around the house scissors for easy jobs.  They are not the sharpest or the most comfortable to use, but for the price you really can't beat it!  We have them in different rooms throughout the house for those quick cut jobs.",4
B07H4N8DL9,"They are very lightweight scissors, but they are also cheap as heck, so whatever. Fits my hand fine.I constantly lose my scissors. I just wanted to buy many for cheap, so at very least, it will take me longer to lose all my scissors.",5
B07H4N8DL9,liked the varity of the colors,4
B07H4N8DL9,Bought for my class but these scissors came with only half sharpened. Yes only 12 could cut. I tried to reach out for replacement and didn't not receive any communication.  I sharped them myself. Otherwise they are sturdy and I like the size.,2
B07H4N8DL9,Great,5
B07H4N8DL9,They are cheap in price and works for what we need,5
B07H4N8DL9,Good scissors,5
B07H4N8DL9,A house can never have too many pairs of scissors! These are very well made and are great for everyday needs.,5
B07H4N8DL9,Perfect for cutting felt for tying blankets,5
B07H4N8DL9,Great value on a pack of 5 quality sharp and comfortable to hold scissors.,5
B07H4N8DL9,Recommend.,5
B07H4N8DL9,I am a high school science teacher and I have kids cut things out all the time. One of the biggest frustrations are budget scissors for larger hands a lot of them are small and made for elementary or middle school. These are nice and some of biggest kids have no issues with them.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"I bought this set for my 5th grade class.  The only scissors passed down to me by the previous teacher were old and small.  This size is perfect for my 10-11 year old students.  They fit my had well too (as a woman).  You cannot beat the price.  Even with tax it was only about a dollar per scissors.  Wow!  They are sharp, have smooth motion, have ergonomic handles, and have held up for half a year so far with no problems. ----Well, the only problem I have is getting my students to return them to the class supply bin and NOT keep them for THEMSELVES.  Haha!I will definitely buy these again, and not because they will wear out, but because students will probably not return them.",5
B07H4N8DL9,"These are perfect for the kitchen, I use them all the time and they wash up very easily.",5
B07H4N8DL9,The scissors were actually larger than expected. These supplies are going to assist education in Africa.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"I have ordered 3 sets as I use them to sew, craft, and trim packages in the kitchen and office as well as having a pair in the car!",5
B07H4N8DL9,Five pairs of scissors under $10 and I think they're pretty good quality definitely could pick the same thing up at Dollar Tree but I like that they're all different colors so I can put them in different rooms and know what I'm using them for I don't want any cross contamination and at Dollar Tree you might not get such a wide variety of colors which is exactly why I turned here,5
B07H4N8DL9,Cheap scissors and stuff to move. I should have spent a little more and got better quality scissors instead.,2
B07H4N8DL9,Not the sturdiest scissors but still solid. Cuts paper and fabric well.,4
B07H4N8DL9,"We have been buying these pack of scissors  as extra gifts for Christmas.  Everyone  puts a pair in kitchen drawers, bathroom drawers, bathrooms, garages, laundry rooms,  etc.  The bright color handles make them easy to find too!!  I just bought another 6 sets  for add on gifts for this year!!",5
B07H4N8DL9,"I'm really pleased with these scissors. They are very comfortable in the hand, and cut just as well as scissors costing $10-15 each at the local big box stores. Only I got FOUR for under $10! They have a nice weight to them, and when you open and close them you can hear the blades lightly rubbing together like you should, there's no slack like you would expect from scissors at this price. I put one in the junk drawer in the kitchen, one on the peg board in the garage, and two in my desk. I'll never be trying to find a pair of scissors again! As for the packaging some people complained about, I didn't find it that hard to open. The packaging is pretty thin plastic and once you get it started you can rip it right open. Yes, you'll need a pair of scissors, box cutter, or knife to cut through the edge... But if you go to the brick and mortar stores, their scissors all come in blister packs too. Such is life. These are nice scissors.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Some of them are sharp enough for kitchen use others for material you have test them all out!,3
B07H4N8DL9,"Having just purchased 25 pairs of scissors, you will find yourself in need of one additional pair of scissors to open the blister packaging.",4
B07H4N8DL9,Must be for kids or something. Not sharp. I guess I have to buy some from somewhere else,4
B07H4N8DL9,"They cut fine - but are very flimsy.  I don't use them much, but I have a feeling I will be replacing them quickly.",3
B07H4N8DL9,I really like these scissors and I put them in dish washer. Great price.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"If you want scissors to cut only 1 piece of paper, then buy these. These are cheap scissors.  They're cutting ability stinks. They are not durable. Come up with the extra cash and buy the better  heavy duty ones",2
B07H4N8DL9,"I do a lot of crafts, so it's nice to have one nearby in every room, but they don't cut fabrics very well. . I ended up using one to cut the mats off my dog... I will admit they are good for cutting yarn. And opening some thin packages. I am up at night a lot due to health problems, and I have poor vision so it's nice to have all of the different colors.",4
B07H4N8DL9,"Every time I went for a pair of scissors, they would be moved and I'd have to start searching the house for them. We had 3 pairs and no one would put them back. So I bought a 25 pack and leg everyone take them where they needed. Eventually we have a pair of scissors in every room near anywhere I'd have to use them. Success!",5
B07H4N8DL9,They are sharp and work well.  Just what I was looking for.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"I needed a few more pairs of scissors and was going to buy the same set of three pairs that I bought just over a year ago.  However when I saw the price had nearly doubled, I decided to look elsewhere and found these. Fortunately when they arrived they were just as good as I'd hoped.The only drawback in either set of 8"" scissors is that only someone with very small hands is going to be able to get all 4 fingers into the slot meant for them. Only 2 or 3 will fit and the index and perhaps the middle finger will have to go above the finger hole. This shouldn't interfere with your ability to use the scissors.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Great scissors for a great price. Seem to be great quality!,5
B07H4N8DL9,"Really happy with these scissors. They were a great deal, and I was able to put scissors throughout my work and home. The colors are very attractive as well. They cut very well.",5
B07H4N8DL9,good quality scissors,5
B07H4N8DL9,Perfect sharpness grape performance qualities amazing very easy of holding nice and comfy easy to clean and I got five pairs for about $5 couldn't believe that if I needed more scissors which I don't think I will anytime soon but if I did I definitely buy more of these,5
B07H4N8DL9,Got this for my daughter's 3rd grade class. Her teacher said they were great! Awesome price and packaged well :),5
B07H4N8DL9,"The Scissors Bulk Set of 5-Pack offers a decent quantity of scissors at an affordable price. While the quantity is certainly a plus, the quality is just average. These scissors get the job done, but they lack the precision and sharpness that I've experienced with higher-end brands. If you need multiple pairs of scissors for basic tasks, this set is a reasonable choice, but don't expect top-tier cutting performance.",3
B07H4N8DL9,"I bought these for teen crafts after they complained (rightfully) about the tiny, blunt child safety scissors.If you are planning on doing a lot of heavy-duty cutting, these are not for you. They are a little bendy and not the sharpest. But for a class of older kids to cut paper and fabric occasionally, they are perfect.",4
B07H4N8DL9,Purchased these for a special event and was very satisfied with the effectiveness of the scissors.,5
B07H4N8DL9,"Their contrasting-color inner comfort grips are attractive and nice and sharp.  At this price for five, what's not to like?  What's more, they're TEN times better than the Avarossa ones I bought around the same time, which cost $9.99 for just TWO, and their blades fit so tight against each other that they're a real pain to use!",5
B07H4N8DL9,"I bought these for work and shared with the amazing ladies that I work with. Everyone loved the scissors and they open wide like the old fashion ones used to. They are sharp and cut really well. As a matter of fact, I liked them so well that I bought the pack of 25 to use at home too. The price was very reasonable and quick shipping.",5
B07H4N8DL9,"I bought these for a project I am doing where I need a lot of scissors. I was worried that they would not be sharp enough to cut fabric, but they are great for that. They are light weight and cut well. I will buy them again next year for the same project.",5
B07H4N8DL9,nothing,5
B07H4N8DL9,"I got these reasonably-priced scissors for sewing kits for Operation Christmas Child boxes for girls aged 10-14. Although probably not what an avid quilter or sewer would want, they will cut fabric and should be fine for beginners.  I will also use them for school supply packets for boys aged 10-14.",5
B07H4N8DL9,"We kept losing out scissors all of the time, so we ordered these. They work for our everyday needs and there are enough of them that we are always able to find a pair when we need them.",5
B07H4N8DL9,"The colors are bright, there are many pairs for the price, they have a comfortable grip, and they are sharp.",5
B07H4N8DL9,These are sharp and work great! I can tell the quality is good!,5
B07H4N8DL9,"My home is in a dimension incompatible with the sustained existence of scissors. One day, we own four pairs of scissors, strategically placed to make life easy when you need a pair. Next week, there are no scissors. Anywhere.These are cheap enough that I don't rage when they inevitably shift into another phase of reality, color coded so I can assign each irresponsible human their own pair of scissors and deny them access to all other scissors, and sharp enough to cut anything that has any business being cut by middle schoolers and husbands.I *will* buy these again. But hopefully not for at least a month.",5
B07H4N8DL9,Wish I would have bought the large pack,5
B07H4N8DL9,I bought these for my daughter's birthday. She has a family and a portal in her house that all kinds of things disappear into. Scissors seemed to be particularly attracted to the portal. I am hoping these will last at least a year. She has stashed them EVERYWHERE.  You might think that for this price they would not be quality. They cut every normal household thing and do it well. She was VERY pleased (and somewhat  amused) and I would buy again. Hopefully not too soon. : ),5
B0C1686VFN,Exactly as described.  I bought 2 kits as gifts.It has everything included to start making things. A nice variety of colors and the tools to cut and make details in the clay. Includes instructions,5
B0C1686VFN,"They're really amazing, and unlike other brands I used, they don't change colors in the oven. It sets really well and the price is really good!",5
B0C1686VFN,From my wife's perspective:My experience: I'm new to polymer clay and this product was a start as I didn't want to buy and ruin expensive clay. I must say I started just like any other beginner making fun crafts with it but my husband was instantly impressed as I guess I have a certain flair for clay. I started small and ended up using an entire block of clay to make something unique.Quantity: This is definitely more than a good amount of clay for a start and its been six months and they're still in good condition. Believe it or not I still have about 10-12 blocks still unused after 40-50 creations.(note: good condition provided they're properly stored and closed from any exposure when not in use).Quality: Some colors are a bit oily so I use corn flour to reduce the stickiness or if they're dry I just mold them for a few secs-mins till they soften. So far I wouldn't say they're ready out of the pack but definitely workable after molding. I used Sculpey glaze to finish the product and it seems to work. I also used some pastels and glitter and it worked just fine. You can check out the images for an idea.Oven safe: They can definitely be baked in the oven at the temperature mentioned on the packaging. I use a foil box with a foil lid to avoid any toxins getting out inside the oven as we use it for food baking as well. It takes me about 15mins to bake and they're pretty solid once out.Issues: They are not ready out of the pack like other expensive clays although this is not a real problem for me. Just putting it out there for those who need this. I did have some breakage issues which I fixed using clay glue but I wouldn't recommend this if you're selling them. I used most of mine to gift them (fridge magnets as they have minimal usage). I had some color transfer issues as some of the darker colors seem to wear off on the lighter colors over time (say after a month or so).Overall I enjoyed my beginner experience with this product as it's definitely worth the money it comes for. I guess it's time to move on to better products out there that are made for selling. Hope you found this review useful!,5
B0C1686VFN,"Purchased a while ago and finally got to opening it, there is no brown as pictured. Was hoping to just have a brown but easy to work with otherwise.",3
B0C1686VFN,They were excited to have so many gorgeous colors to use crafting!  Both were beyond thrilled at this gift!,5
B0C1686VFN,I have bought this exact selection (50 Colors (bright colors) | Size: 25g / pcs) four times now. The plastic container is very convenient but the clay comes in non-reusable plastic bags so be prepared to use plastic wrap to store unused clay. My kids do not make use of the tools.My kids love it and use it to craft all sorts of things from small figures and miniature food to large containers. If the latter is the primary use case then I would suggest getting larger blocks of clay. One of my daughters used multiple colors to form a rainbow worm which was spiraled into a pencil holder. There would not be enough clay to build such a container in a single color.We use the various attachments though we do not let our daughter use the earrings out of an abundance of caution because she has sensitive skin and those these say hypoallergenic we do not want to risk it.,5
B0C1686VFN,"Kids love the clay, it has worked well, they enjoy the sculpting tools that came with it, they love the texture, the colors. We mostly oven baked the clay and it came out fine. Like the versatility of the bundle. Overall I would recommend to others, if the pricing is still the same as when I bought it or cheaper.",5
B0C1686VFN,"We really loved this clay. I will say that it can be a bit brittle after you bake it though. Make it nice and thick. But overall, I am very pleased with this order.",4
B0C1686VFN,I bought it for make christmas ornament  and a little bit hard  it require kneading to get smoot texture.,4
B0C1686VFN,"While I do like it, and it's my first time working with polymer clay I don't necessarily love it. It was hard to mold into shapes even when using mold cutters. In fact I find it rather difficult using it. It has ALOT of colors to choose from but the ones that I really needed they had very little of(black, grey n white) does not dry easy. No bad smells. Whatever shape you're going for falls apart easily ,so you have to keep at it just to get it right, especially with small parts.I'm trying to make the coffin book shelf and it's taken me an eternity to do so.(Made coffin book shelf earrings) it'll be easier to make larger size polymer figures. So far I made three coffins already.. I guess It's a good kit to have just for fun and I will keep trying to make more and perfect my clay skills!",4
B0C1686VFN,"I got this clay for a project at work.  It is soft to work with and dries hard in the oven (though it did take longer than the instructions said).  My main complaint is that the colors that were advertized were not the colors I recieved.  There were only about 18 colors in my package (but there were 55 packets of clay).  Looking through the booklet of project ideas that came with it, none of them could be completed with the clay I received because there was no red, black, grey, or brown, and only one shade of blue.  It doesn't effect my use, but may have an impact on others looking for certain colors to be included.",4
B0C1686VFN,"LOVE WORKING WITH POLYMER CLAY  I just wish the pieces were each just a bit larger, so with this set I usually buy 2 sets at a time.  Directions for Polyer clay are very basic and easy to understand.",4
B0C1686VFN,Go9d value for the money. I don't care about the colors I just need it in larger quantities as I am an artist and have a lot of projects in the works so probably won't buy this again I also like the little case and tools that came with it very handy. Great set for someone just starting out.,4
B0C1686VFN,My niece loves to make things and this was great.,5
B0C1686VFN,Kids love it.,5
B0C1686VFN,Good quality.  Just wish they were bigger.,4
B0C1686VFN,I love it so cute,5
B0C1686VFN,"Overall, I actually give it about 3.5 stars but I rounded up to a 4.So, a couple things to note: I don't sculpt; I have only ""sculpted"" a couple things in my life prior to this and it was when I was a kid (for school) so don't take this as a professional review or too much of any type of a decent review whatsoever. I bought this to experiment with making my own artisan keycaps because buying it from others have proven to be quite expensive in the long run and I can be a very frugal person at times.The clay feels a little stiff out of the packaging - I assume that's just how polymer clay is but I wouldn't know since I haven't worked with it before so I can't compare it to other brands - but after a couple rounds of squishing(?) it around, it becomes very soft and malleable. I have yet to use all the colors but I have used like 5 of them or so and they've all been okay EXCEPT the black. The black stains really horribly so be careful with it because it will get everywhere, especially on your fingers. So when working with that one, I would actually roll it around on some paper towel a bit to get rid of some excess dye and oils and I make sure I have plenty of isopropyl alcohol around to clean up any other further staining on my hands and work area. All the colors I have worked with so far all have some staining but they were nowhere as extreme as the black.Baking it was a breeze. For my keycaps, I just baked them at 250F for about 15-20 minutes, let them cool for another 15 or so, and then I would gloss them up with some UV gel and BAM, completed. They feel durable enough to the touch and fidgeting around with, but I'm not tossing them onto hard flooring to really test their durability.Considering I am a total noob with clay, I would say this is good for beginners, especially because it's cheap so I would actually recommend it to beginners or people who really don't care too much about ""high quality"" crafts. When I use this all up, I probably would buy something else though unless they're all similar to this. With it being so cheap, I can mess up as many times as I want and experiment more with polymer clay and not lose anything out of it.",4
B0C1686VFN,"Clay not suited for detailed work,  crumbles after baking I not sealed with uv resin",3
B0C1686VFN,"This is a substantial amount of clay! A  7 inch dinosaur needs air clay, mugs need 2 lbs of pottery clay. This polymer is for jewelry, millifiori, ornaments etc. We spent 8 hrs playing and only opened 7 of 24 packages! Recommend purchase of white clay separately.",5
B0C1686VFN,"Shipping was on time. You get a lot of colors, clay definitely is for beginners.  This is not good for professional. Some colors can transfer to your skin, make sure to always was your hands.",4
B0C1686VFN,"some of the tools are super useful, and the plastic edges can be kind of sharp but the clay was good. The instructions give you a few options on how to harden the clay, I do not recommend boiling it because I did not work for me at all lol",4
B0C1686VFN,All the colors were delivered. But just note that the clay blocks themselves are smaller than palm size and the tools that it was supposed to come with the kit never got included with mine.,3
B0C1686VFN,"The first set we got was too hard, we couldn't do anything with it. I initiated a return and asked for a replacement, and the new set is great. We haven't baked it yet, though. Will update review in the future.",4
B0C1686VFN,My bonus daughter loved it for her birthday,4
B0C1686VFN,"We had a blast making this. Easy to use, cooks as expected. Does not dry out. Great gift. Comes with extra supplies",5
B0C1686VFN,"We were visiting kids' grandparents, and decided to have kids make some small gifts to them that could last long. We pick this one. It is a good choice. The color look attractive and didn't fade after baking. It does produce an unpleasant but bearable smell after baking so you want to keep the door open after baking to let that smell dissipate. Quality wise, so far so good. We didn't see cracks on the baked ones. We do use a little longer time than instructed (say 1hr instead of 30min) and saw no downside so far. I would recommend this product and similar type.",5
B0C1686VFN,"So I was interested in making some stuff out of polymer clay. I have worked with other clay before, but mostly just modeling stuff. I grabbed this since it had a variety of colors and some basic tools (it was also nice that it came in a box to keep dust off the clay, even if it's kind of a cheap plastic).Just so you know, the bars of clay are pretty small, but usually people buy colors in small sizes (2 oz) and keep the ones they use regularly in larger quantities (8 or 16 oz). That's not a downside, just so you know what to expect.I've made a couple things with this clay. The first was a fly amanita mushroom that I also used Sculpey III for. I unfortunately no longer have photos of the sculpting process, but when I baked red caps for these there were some cracks that appeared in the clay. They're relatively small though, and if you sand them enough you could probably fix this (I got tired of this even using my sandpaper and just painted them instead). I've included photos of the final product, which included the sculpey III (the white of the mushroom) and paint, but it looks great! So you can get details with this, it's just time-consuming.I also have some photos of leaves I made using what is intended as a silicone gumpaste or fondant mold. It did pick up and hold the texture decently, but good luck actually sculpting that in by hand. Also, though my instructions in the kit said to bake the pieces on an aluminum sheet, I wouldn't do that. I tested the leaves on both aluminum foil and parchment, and there's a few parts of the aluminum-baked leaves that are oddly shiny (hopefully this shows up in the photo where I'm holding a leaf). It's subtle, and if you paint them it won't matter, but I'd say stick to parchment. The leaves do have some flex to them still, but feel somewhat brittle. I'm worried about bending them too much in case they snap.All in all, not a bad buy if you get it for the right price and you just want to try out the material. But you'll definitely need to buy additional items in order to make really detailed stuff",4
B0C1686VFN,I bought this for my kids to make their worry stones. They loved being about to choose colors and they were able to make their creations with ease. The colors are still vibrant after setting using the oven.,5
B0C1686VFN,Bought to play with and made so many mini things. Definitely worth it.,5
B0C1686VFN,Too many yellows in the kit I received. Lacking on blue and purple.,3
B0C1686VFN,Heat at 200 for 2 hours.  Love the colors!,5
B0C1686VFN,I wanted to make magnets and this clay was exactly what I wanted!,5
B0C1686VFN,"I used this for a ""clay date"". I am not an artist. I chose this because for the color variation - the price was very reasonable. The individual wrapped clay seemed wasteful however I understand why it is necessary. I recommend this for hobby use.",5
B0C1686VFN,"Comes with a lot of color options and different tools. Fun craft to do with friends or kids. I had so much fun making frigde magnets, only took 15 min to bake and was good to go.",5
B0C1686VFN,"Grandkids love it, this is the third time it has been purchased. Lots of clay for the money. Remember when making designs with thicker clay the item will take longer to bake.",5
B0C1686VFN,,5
B0C1686VFN,"The box is smaller than I expected, but this is great for beginners who just wants to try creating small models for fun. With 1/4 of a color slab, I was able to make a 1.25in x 1in x 0.5in model",5
B0C1686VFN,Great colors,4
B0C1686VFN,"This is a beautiful assortment of colored polymer clay.  50 Colors!!!  It's soft and easy to handle.The clay is colorfast and you can make beautiful marbled effects.  I like to have 'clay play' with my 4 yo and 6 yo grandchildren.  They make all kinds of sculptures and I almost always end up making little bowls that I use for jewelry, soap dishes, catch-alls.You can use a pasta machine to flatten this clay, but it's so workable that it's not really necessary.  It bakes evenly.  I use a dedicated toaster oven in my craft room that we refer to as 'grandma's easy bake oven' (for safety - only grandma is allowed to use the oven!)This set comes with tools and various findings.  Very happy with this set!",5
B0C1686VFN,Ordered this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. Got it the day after ordering it.,5
B0C1686VFN,My kids have enjoyed playing with it. Has a variety of colors. Just as described and arrived quickly.,5
B0C1686VFN,Great valueMade a number of things with my Grands.,5
B0C1686VFN,"I had high hopes for this clay for a large project. I thought I could maybe get away with a cheaper product. When working with the clay, the dye came off on my hands. I returned this product and purchased the Sculpy, which I've always had great luck with.",2
B0C1686VFN,The clay has to be conditioned for a bit before you can use I always use sculpy clay. don't expect you clay to be like sculpy because it's not and don't expect too much it's just everyday run of the mill polymer clay. My kids love this clay. You get like 50 colors and a great price.,3
B0C1686VFN,Love this clay ...very easy to work with....my Granddaughter loves it !!! Very much worth the money I only wish the colors were available in larger sizes,5
B0C1686VFN,"My daughter used to make clay figures when she was 7-10 but petered out on it after a while, she is very good. I ordered this kit because she has some anxiety and depression, doing art type things helps her process her feeling and not let her thought get away from her. She also does it for fun but we talked to her therapist about it and he said that it was a really good idea. This kit has plenty of colors and tools to help you mold your figures and the oven baking is so simple and they come out really well. I definitely recommend this for your budding artist at any age!",5
B0C1686VFN,"Bakes a lil too fast but great product, made tons of jewelry!!",4
B0C1686VFN,"Bought as ""something to do"" for 2 13 year old girls - HUGE hit and they spent hours with this",5
B0C1686VFN,Lots of colors nice quality,5
B0C1686VFN,I was really pleased. Come in a great. Storage box with sculpting tools and metal extras to make keychains etc. Great value for the money. Highly recommend.,5
B0C1686VFN,This has been a wonderful activity for my daughter! Able to be creative and so many colors to choose from. Highly recommend!,5
B0C1686VFN,Such a good deal and so much quality clay for a fun project!!!!,5
B0C1686VFN,"Gift for my daughter.  She had a wonderful time making characters from her favorite video game.  When done, we followed the instructions and baked them.  They set up and now she has figurines she made herself, with plenty of material for more art projects.  Would definitely buy again - they arrived quickly and well packaged.",5
B0C1686VFN,"My daughter used it for a project, it was very fun !",5
B0C1686VFN,This was amazing to get my feet wet with polymer clay. It lasted me a long time and helped me to get started comfortably,5
B0C1686VFN,"This product is much softer than typical polymer clay, so it's great for my needs.  The colors are cool but some are so similar it's hard to tell if they are different at all or they are so close you wouldn't notice unless inspecting. This dues not bother me so much. The blocks of each color are unevenly cut I guess roughly 1 inch by 1 inch. It comes with a very limited instruction book. I haven't used it yet but will update this review if needed.",4
B0C1686VFN,Daughter saved up to buy this set and loved it.  Seemed fair for the price to what you got.,5
B0C1686VFN,My child enjoys using the clay to make little things,5
B0C1686VFN,"Just received my package and when I opened it up I was pretty disappointed. All of the clay is fine, but the extras that come with it are all rusted and gross. There was even a bug in my package. If you order for the clay only you should be okay. But do NOT order with intention to use any extras that come with it.",3
B0C1686VFN,Kept my kids busy for a week!! Super cool craft even I enjoyed it as an adult definitely recommend getting this to keep kids busy!!,5
B0C1686VFN,"This is a good kit to introduce older kids to sculpting. Comes with a little pack of metal earrings and pin bits for small creations. Our family has sensitive ears so we likely won't use the earrings but it was very thoughtful to include them and we will use the other pieces. Purchased this for our 12 year old daughter for Christmas and it is exactly what she needed. A wide variety of colors to play with and they are all pretty soft. Small amount of each color perfect for small jewelry, making miniatures, and things like that. This might not be enough clay if you want to do a large project. Helpful booklet explains how to cure the clay. Also super happy with the plastic container everything is stored in but I do have some advice concerning the container. I am a professional artist and used polymer clay every day for several years. I stored my clay in a similar container. Over time the clay bits kind of melted into the container as if there was a chemical reaction of some sort. I would recommend wrapping each color in plastic wrap to keep everything clean and lasting as long as possible.Thank you!",5
B0C1686VFN,Excellent quality!! My 12 year old has made some amazing creations with it!,5
B0C1686VFN,Great variety of colors and possibilities of creative inventions! My daughter was thrilled.,5
B0C1686VFN,"I got this as a craft activity for my kids 9 and under. There was plenty of clay for all four kids, and we still have more than half left for more activities. We made hand-shaped bowls, and they all enjoyed playing with them. As it was my first time using this type of clay I let them sit in the oven a little longer than the directions said, but I still found them to remain relatively soft after cooking. I expected them to be harder, but I don't know what is normal so I can't complain. I appreciate that there are some jewelry and ornament findings as well for future creating.",5
B0C1686VFN,Soft clay but colors were not as pictured,4
B0C1686VFN,My granddaughter loved it.,5
B0C1686VFN,Good fun date idea!,5
B0C1686VFN,Great,5
B0C1686VFN,Love the colors however it is very wet.,4
B0C1686VFN,We (grandkids and grandma) loved so many colors and shades of colors - plenty to go around so no arguing about who used what. Girls were impressed with the three tier case and jewelry supplies and boys loved the tools. We packed it around from house to house to play with cousins. Many hours of fun with even a grumpy 13 year old that sat at the table and created funny animals. Lots of talking! Ages 3-13 and all had fun. The clay is a little stiff so had to be warmed up with bigger hands before use by the 3 year old.,5
B0C1686VFN,Got this for my niece and nephews and they loved it.  So did grandma and mom and dad.  Spent hours making all sorts of creations :),5
B00MFTLNU0,worked good,5
B00MFTLNU0,These are a nice thickness and laminate well. Durable items after laminating is complete. It fits letter sized paper. Heats well and so easy to use.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"Fast delivery, fast distribution, product quality is also very good",5
B00MFTLNU0,"This is the perfect product, I will continue to buy for my business needs.",5
B00MFTLNU0,Oh this is so slick! Heats quickly and is quiet. Just sucks it in and spits it out,5
B00MFTLNU0,I like the thickness of these lamination sheets. I make lots of learning materials and cover them in the sheets so they will hold up under little soggy hands.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Arrived on time and worked flawlessly.  Good buy if you own the laminator.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"I love this brand over all the other's I have tried when it comes to adhere-ability, as well as thickness. However, when I opened my front door to retrieve my package I was shocked that it came in no packaging at all! The box had been ripped on both edges and taped up 3 times by shipping tape to hold the clear envelope with the sheets inside the actual carboard original box. There was no shipping envelope, no amazon box, it was so very weird.It came next day? so I am thinking it was just grabbed up slapped a label from the nearby Amazon facility so I highly doubt this is the brand names 'modus operandi', but still. I wanted everyone to know that if they're ordering long distance expect it to come damaged if they do not package it! They literally slapped the label on the envelope of sleeves and expected that to suffice. Anyway, I am sure it is functional but wanted to leave this review.",4
B00MFTLNU0,Purchased this product to laminate company and club badges.,5
B00MFTLNU0,it's working as expected,5
B00MFTLNU0,"Just what I was looking for, with quick shipping!",5
B00MFTLNU0,"great - only returned because I returned the laminator. No jams or wrinkles. Good size, nice quality. Only one bubble because of a mislay. When heating, chose to heat twice.",4
B00MFTLNU0,every BCBA must have these at all times; great for classroom visual; PECS and token board; this brand is the best; make sure to buy the scotch laminator for best results,5
B00MFTLNU0,I really like using the to preserve special documents. I have never had any problems with them sealing together when using my thermal laminator. Scorching a brand you can trust for quality. The pages feed through the laminated smoothly and are free from wrinkles when done,5
B00MFTLNU0,Great for laminating things that need to go in binders or hang on wall for the year!,5
B00MFTLNU0,Love them,5
B00MFTLNU0,Loved how many sheets come with this package,5
B00MFTLNU0,"Now that I have a laminator, I use it all the time. Five mil stuff is good and heavy duty.",5
B00MFTLNU0,I can definitely tell the different between this and the cheap stuff. Very good so far.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Good product. Nice and thick. Use this for some clients and they like them.,5
B00MFTLNU0,This ultra thick laminating slip makes it easy to waterproof things as long as you don't cut too close to the edge of you drawing it will be waterproof. I would recommend this product to any furry artist that makes badges or teachers that need to waterproof work sheets for their students.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Loved this product.  It was super easy to laminate items for my classroom.,5
B00MFTLNU0,These laminating sheets are of high quality! It is a little cheaper due to my subscription!  Easy to use!! Highly recommend these!,5
B00MFTLNU0,IT SHOWED UP QUICK AND WORKS GREAT,5
B00MFTLNU0,Very durable and easy to use,5
B00MFTLNU0,"Very disappointed. I've never used this brand, but the one I usually use was on backorder.  I laminated 4 3x3 squares of copy paper and there were air pockets around each square. You need to cut a 1/2 inch  border around each square so it doesn't peel.  As a teacher, I laminate A LOT and can't afford to have my materials peeling and having to redo my work.",2
B00MFTLNU0,"GREAT PRODUCT, AS DECSRIBED. Great Price..",5
B00MFTLNU0,"I have ordered this product more than once . The prior times I have not had an issue . The product itself is great.  However, I received my order and it was empty . It was not in an Amazon box . It was in the original package with a shipping label . The laminate sheets had fallen out during transport . So,I was delivered an empty box . I am all for reducing waste . Maybe they can use tape to keep the package closed . I had no issue receiving a refund ! I highly recommend the product .",3
B00MFTLNU0,"Love this laminator.  Easy to use, heats quickly. Great value.",5
B00MFTLNU0,Got the 5mil and ran perfect through my Scotch laminator. Also was able to punch through it with my Proclick50. Excellent product especially if putting together books for homeschooling. I put in another order since it's such a great product. Giving it a 5 star rating for sure!,5
B00MFTLNU0,great product,5
B00MFTLNU0,As stated in description.,5
B00MFTLNU0,the 100 pack is the best price for these.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"I love Amazon I order alot this lamination paper did not have one piece of tape on the box, so the contents would stay in the box.  This should of been taped and put in a pouch just to keep it safe and no one knows what I'm getting.  Thanks",5
B00MFTLNU0,Great for my laminator.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Works perfectly and is as clear is can be after it is run through its process. These laminate sheets by scotch are always a safe bet you are going to get a good product for the money.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Worked well. No complaints.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"I've had this for years now and use it in spurts - but always reliable and easy to use.  Quiet, fast enough to warm up, I do recommend standing by to remove the sheet as it completes the cycle or it'll wrinkle up - or wavy up the last 1/4"" of the sheet.  I couldn't do without this for classroom preparation and various home needs as well.  FIVE STAR for sure!",5
B00MFTLNU0,"I am a first-grade teacher, and I need to laminate a lot of things for the classroom. I decided to get the 5M laminating sheets so that my materials can be used from here two year, and they would remain sturdy. I am very happy with this product, and will definitely be purchasing again when I am in need of more!",5
B00MFTLNU0,Works as specified,5
B00MFTLNU0,Very strong laminate and great price!,5
B00MFTLNU0,Super thick and sturdy,5
B00MFTLNU0,As advertised,5
B00MFTLNU0,The pouches are not the size stated.  It does not fit a letter size sheet. 8 1/2 x 11,3
B00MFTLNU0,"Page guide to low. Difficult to align page so it feeds straight through. Also need to raise machine higher off the work surface, or ""tip"" the machine on an angle so the laminated page does not develop a curl when it contacts the work surface.",4
B00MFTLNU0,I had to laminate quite a few pages for a project and it worked flawlessly,5
B00MFTLNU0,I got this for my daughter!!! She uses it all the time for her classes!!! Perfect purchase,5
B00MFTLNU0,Worked as stated and great adhesion,5
B00MFTLNU0,good quality,5
B00MFTLNU0,The product was easy to use to do my lesson plan,5
B00MFTLNU0,My primary use with this item is my card making. So many uses besides the normal. Heavy duty crystal clear and easy to use.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Got these for bag tags at school and created supper sturdy and waterproof tags for the kids,5
B00MFTLNU0,Good quality but a little pricey,4
B00MFTLNU0,"For the few dollars spent, I can't imagine wanting for more.  This little guy does the job.",5
B00MFTLNU0,Would buy again,5
B00MFTLNU0,Good.,5
B00MFTLNU0,This is a fantastic product that does a great job laminating 22lb paper and card stock. Highly recommend. Five full stars.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"The Scotch Thermal laminating pouches , when used with the Scotch ( 3M company) thermal laminator, do a fine job of encapsulating photos and documents to preserve them and protect them .  The 5 mil thick pouches make for a stiffer encapsulation than do the regular 3 mil pouches .  However, the 3 mil pouches are fine for most uses. I noticed that the package for the thicker 5 mil product states that it's 5 mil, but the package for the thinner 3 mil does not state the thickness. One limitation of these laminating pouches is that the final result is not entirely flat, but always has some slight curvature or wavy appearance .  For something like a scrapbook or photo album where numerous pages are next to each other, these laminations may not be flat enough. I use the non-thermal laminating sheets , which have a room temperature adhesive inside , for applications where flatness is required.The thermal laminating pouches are fine if you're going to hold down the sheet with thumbtacks or magnets, or a small amount of curl is acceptable.",5
B00MFTLNU0,"works great, at a low setting for my older laminator that uses carrier holder.",5
B00MFTLNU0,"I've been using Scotch brand laminating sleeves for years.  These 5mil sleeves are just the right stiffness when laminated. And for 100 sleeves, they should last me years.  Great product.",5
B00MFTLNU0,I print out may of the bagmaking patterns I purchase and got tired of them wearing out after being traced a few times.  I purchased a laminator and these sheets to laminate all of the patterns.  These are sturdy and do a great job keeping my patterns strong and just the same shape as when they were first made.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Product thickness,5
B00MFTLNU0,"This review is for the 5mil laminating sheets.5mil is what most consider for ""standard"" lamination.  3mil will still protect the paper, but feels thin.  7mil and above is rather unusual for typical school and business documents.The sheets themselves are standard issue ""pocket"" type.  Work great.  Bought it with the Amazon brand laminator.The box however is complete junk.  The sheets are wrapped in thin plastic and have to be removed from the box to open them.  Have fun getting it back in.  They could have made it a little better.",5
B00MFTLNU0,This is our go-to laminating pouches.  Work great.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"I always have good results with Scotch brand laminating pouches.  I'm a teacher, and I use them to laminate game cards to use in the classroom.  I like the 5 mil sheets because they provide an extra thick covering so that the pieces are more durable.  I am able to laminate sheets of cards and cut them apart after laminating without any trouble.  I rarely have any issues with the sheets not adhering to what I am laminating.  If this does ever happen, I simply run the piece through the laminator again to reseal it.  I am able to laminate things printed on both paper and cardstock without any trouble. These are my favorite brand of laminating pouches.",5
B00MFTLNU0,I use hundreds of these laminating sheets per year. This product works well and without issue. Highly recommend.,5
B00MFTLNU0,The machine works perfectly I laminate things for fun like my covid card .,5
B00MFTLNU0,I use these for laminating all my roll and write score sheets and reference sheets that come with my board games. They work perfect with the Scotch laminator I have. I preferer these .5 mil sheets because they are sturdy and offer a nice feel when handling them. They work well with dry or wet erase markers. They are my go-to laminating sheets. I blew through my first 100 pack in less than six months and purchased these again without batting an eye.,4
B00MFTLNU0,This is my 2nd package of ordering these 5ML laminating pouches. They are really nice and thick and they work great in my laminator machine. I haven't had any trouble with yellowing or curling at all!,5
B00MFTLNU0,These are probably the best lamination pouches I've ever used. They are the perfect thickness and end result is perfect every time.,5
B00MFTLNU0,I like this brand I think they are the best ones for the money.  They hold up well and they are thick.  I also have found that I can use dry erase markers and clean with Clorox whips and the kids can use as white boards.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"I'm not sure why I didn't buy a laminator before.  I just love it.  I use it to make plant tags.  I print the labels on my ink jet, cut them out and then run them though the laminator.  If you don't know, you need the 5 mil thickness (this product) to have tags that can stand up by themselves.  Be warned that once you run the plastic through the laminator it is too thick to cut with an exacto knife.  You will need to use scissors.  If you need precision cutting, you need stay with the 3 mil or less thickness, and then you can use a blade to cut the plastic.  Depends on the art project you are doing.",5
B00MFTLNU0,"Good value, laminates well",5
B00MFTLNU0,Love it! Awesome for what I needed it for,5
B00MFTLNU0,Very sturdy. Produces excellent laminations.,5
B00MFTLNU0,Love these.  They work great with my machine.  I've bought several different sizes,5
B00MFTLNU0,"For use in a special education classroom, the 5 mm is most durable.  Great quality, no bubbles when machine is heated correctly.",5
B00MFTLNU0,I always use the 5 Mil sheets. These work great and I can get the 100 pack.,5
B00MFTLNU0,I like to preserve some of my pictures and prints from fading over time. Problem solved!,5
B00MFTLNU0,"they are as advertized, nice and thick laminate sheets for whatever you want laminated, and are pretty stiff. Not recommended for anything that you can dont want to be super stiff, use 3mm for that, otherwise great product",5
B00MFTLNU0,I really love these.. I have a tutoring business and I use this product often to make my lessons... It is strong and looks great!,5
B00MFTLNU0,These things are fantastic!  I am a teacher and it is so handy to have the 5 mil available for my TPT's!  Our school's laminator is a very thin guage (for which I am thankful) but sometimes you just want a heavier  - not quite so bendy finish.  I will say do not cut close to the edge because the laminate will come apart.  Cut with some space around your paper.  And - it's a stinker to cut because it is heavy. But the heavy is what makes it so durable!  I totally recommend this product!,5
B00MFTLNU0,Ty,5
B00MFTLNU0,Absolutely love these 5ml pouches.  Worth every dime.,5
B00MFTLNU0,"I use thousands of laminating pouches for work and these are great.  They come out crystal clear.  Easy to use.Here's a tip:  if you print on cardstock paper and use these pouches, you will get a nice stiff laminated piece.  We use these for training materials.  When you use cardstock, you can use pouches that are not as thick (5ml) and will save you a lot of money over the 7ml and you won't get a flimsy laminated item.",5
B00MFTLNU0,"High quality and no issues whatsoever.  Each sleeve has adhered perfectly without issues.  I tried an ""off brand"" product, and it's just not the same.  I'm very pleased with this purchase and will probably go back and purchase more in the future.",5
B0011N832C,"I use these everywhere!- Sticking decorations (tissue paper flowers) to my wall- Closing boxes/containers- Adhering things to tables (e.g., a small vase)- Hanging twinkle lights (the wire type) on my wallGreat product!",5
B0011N832C,Perfect for baby books- scrapbooking - photo album- extremely secure and easy to use,5
B0011N832C,These are pretty easy to use and help my baskets to look very professional.,4
B0011N832C,"I had read many times where diamond painters recommended glue dots for single placing. Since I was tired of changing my wax so often, I was willing to give them a try. They are great! I am never going back to wax.",5
B0011N832C,quality productaffordable,5
B0011N832C,"One of the best inventions that were made for children's crafts.  I teach a Bible class to elementary children and use Glue Dots often.  The regular school glue is messy and doesn't dry in time for the children to take their craft with them when they leave.  Of course it costs more than standard glue, but it's worth it.",5
B0011N832C,These are much thinner than I expected and I needed to use way more than I thought I would. Very difficult to remove from paper backing. They are very sticky and hold.,3
B0011N832C,Great for so many crafts,5
B0011N832C,"These Glue Dots were perfect for putting together a gift basket. They held items in place securely, made the setup super easy, and left no mess or residue. Highly recommend for any DIY projects like this.",5
B0011N832C,These work great for crafts!,5
B0011N832C,Fast service great product thanks BP.,5
B0011N832C,Love getting this through Amazon. I used a ton while crafting with residents at a nursing home. These fits are the perfect size. They are able to pull them off with the paper I attach to them. The bigger ones are too big and the paper tears.Plus they are hard to find in any quantity in stores. I was ordering 15 at a time.Come in really sturdy boxes that can be reused for many things!,5
B0011N832C,Love using the glue dots for diamond art paintings . I have had to refill my pen and it has been 3 weeks.,5
B0011N832C,Holds crafts in place. Easy to use. A must for paper crafts. Excellent value for the price.,5
B0011N832C,These are the only ones I use. In fact I order all different sizes too. So easy to use and the adhesion is strong.,5
B0011N832C,Great sticking power.  Would buy again.,5
B0011N832C,"These dots are great for scrapbooking.  Easy to peel and adhesive is strong.  Not so thick that it looks bumpy underneath your photos when you tack them down.  You can get them cheaper at the craft store, but you pay for the convenience of having them shipped directly to your door.",5
B0011N832C,Real glue,5
B0011N832C,"These are real game changer. They hold more firmly than candlestick stickers. I use these to adhere wicks to my candle jars and they are great. Yes, I would recommend these.",5
B0011N832C,"I'm an avid scrapbooker and these save lives! They stick really well, so be careful and intentional when using. They are pretty easy to keep track of if you keep the roll in the box. Only thing is that they run out pretty quick. You'll probably have to use about 4 dots per picture and it goes fast. I definitely recommend these, but go ahead and buy either a larger count or a couple boxes (or both)!",5
B0011N832C,"These are easy to use, stick to so many things, and lost a while!!!! They are pretty thick but I found I could stretch and shape them a bit when I needed something thinner or smaller",5
B0011N832C,They work to good they are permanent,4
B0011N832C,I've used these for several crafts and they haven't failed me yet..they stick strong so make sure you have it in the right place because there is no moving things once they are placed on whatever you put them on,5
B0011N832C,"I was preparing almost twenty centerpieces for a wedding reception and couldn't get anything to stick to the glass vase & the ribbon except Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller which was hard to remove from the glass.  Scotch Permanent Double Sided Tape, 1/2 x 250 Inches 3-Pack Caddy(3136)        was hard to remove from the glass, and wouldn't stick to the ribbon.  Scotch Magic Tape, 3/4 x 1000 Inches, 6-Count Package (810K6)        stuck to the glass & the ribbon...if I didn't fold it in half to hide it,  Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller Value Pack .31 Inches x 49 Feet, 4-Pack (6055BNS)        stuck to both the vase & the ribbon, but was hard to remove from the glass...so I remembered that glue dots worked for all my past craft projects. After sending my hubby to an office supply store (where they never heard of them & didn't carry them), I didn't have time to run from store to store looking for glue dots so I ordered these from Amazon...and they worked wonderfully!!!  They can even be stretched.  Glue Dots Glue Dots 1/2-Inch Craft Dots, 200-Clear Dots/Roll        saved me lots of time, saved my day & my sanity!  They stuck to both the ribbon & the glass, were easy to remove & didn't leave any messy residue on the glass.5 starsMade in the USA",5
B0011N832C,I am able to have cycling accessories stay where I want them on my bicycle  - Lights and bells stay in position with the Glue Dots...,5
B0011N832C,"Perfect for photo albums, scrapbooks & more. The keep everything in place.",5
B0011N832C,I purchased this to help my kindergarten students assemble their art projects independently. These work great and keep art projects together. This is better than one teacher having to man a hot glue station. Now I use these for everything in my classroom.,5
B0011N832C,"Easy to use, strong adhesive.",5
B0011N832C,Holds well but hard to remove from wood trim and doors as well as whatever you have hanging with it.,4
B0011N832C,Too hard to try to use.,3
B0011N832C,Honest truth I live for glue dots. I'm a crafter and I take them almost everywhere I go.,5
B0011N832C,These dots work but are very hard to handle. They want to curl up,3
B0011N832C,"Do you need to glue something but you need to make sure it's super stable? Do you need to glue something and you don't want to wait for glue to dry? Insert Glue dots! They are strong, don't need dry time, can be used on a huge variety of projects and over all is a crafters best friend",5
B0011N832C,I always have these on hand! Great for pictures or bulletins.,5
B0011N832C,a balloon artist these glue dots are my favorite. Super stick!,5
B0011N832C,"These dots are small and you need to figure out how to use them correctly to make things stick together.  You need to place the item on the glue dot while the glue dot is still on the roll, (rather than peel the glue dot off the roll first).  Then, lift the item and glue dot off the roll.  My 5 year old grandson figured out how to do this while gluing google eyes onto his craft.  They would work for kids ages 5 and up with adult guidance.  Not sure if I would buy these again, but they seem to make things stick once you figure out how to use them.",4
B0011N832C,I have been using it to secure candle wicks to the bottom of the jar and it works really well.  I will purchase again.,5
B0011N832C,"These are nice and sticky, and get the job done.  If you can get them to lie flat, whatever you are trying to stick will also lie flat.  However, I did find it a bit difficult not to roll the sides of them when transferring onto whatever surface I wanted to stick.  It is a little easier if you use one of those little dispensers that lies them out for you, but this will do in a pinch.  It wasn't enough to deter me from using, and I would repurchase.  They're easy to remove but have good lasting power.  Overall, a quality product.",4
B0011N832C,I love glue dots.  They hold well.,5
B0011N832C,I came across this accidentally on Amazon and I'm happy I did.  This is essentially the same stuff banks use to attach new credit cards to cardstock when they mail it to you.  These glue dots work quite well.  They glue items together tightly but not permanently.  My 7 year old twin granddaughters use them for craft projects.  They aren't messy like glue and are stronger than glue sticks.  They don't wrinkle paper like white glue does.  There's no waiting for it to dry - they stick instantly.  Perfect for kids' crafts!  Probably ideal for use with poster boards too but I haven't tried that.,4
B0011N832C,Stuck.real.well I would get a bigger dot .It does what it supposed to do.super easy toWork with .,5
B0011N832C,Expensive but did the job,4
B0011N832C,These sticks really good,5
B0011N832C,I like the dots because they work for my diorama figurines.,5
B0011N832C,Was hard to work with otherwise it did stick once you got it where you wanted it!!,5
B0011N832C,I use dots to adhere wicks to my candle jars.  This particular brand isn't as sticky as some other brands I have used.  I won't be buying again.,2
B0011N832C,Bought these to adhere giant birthday balloons & fabric on hotel room walls. The adhesives are tiny circles approx. 1cm in diameter. But the awesome thing is you can double/triple up on these to make bigger balls of glue. They are very versatile that way depending on what you're trying to hang. Removal was a breeze and left no mark on the walls.,5
B0011N832C,It didn't stuck nothing.,1
B0011N832C,"Pretty good. I used these to stick two nonporous surfaces together. They don't dry out completely; so in my experience, I would consider them removable. But they're still very sticky. You'd have to actively try to remove the two glued pieces apart.",4
B0011N832C,If you need it to stick...these are your thing! If you need to salvage anything....make sure you buy ones labeled removeable!,5
B0011N832C,"These glue dots do hold, but they hold on to the paper tape really well.  So I had to tear the tape off, put it on my item, heat the opposite side of the item with a hair driver, while pushing down.  Then I had to slowly peal back the tape, using my fingernail to help encourage the dot to stay on the item.  My item required a LOT of them, so this took quite awhile.  End result though, they're holding.",3
B0011N832C,Great item,5
B0011N832C,I tried two different types of glue dots for a Bible school project and this one worked great!,5
B0011N832C,Work well. Be careful what you stick them too. I think it could take off paint they are strong.,5
B0011N832C,Very happy.,4
B0011N832C,"I create candy with floral and decorative items into arrangements for birthdays and holidays. My partner used to use hot glue, then we switched to scotch tape. The glue melted the pcs of candy and the tape seems to be going downhill in its usability. I figured the glue dots were worth a shot. A very good shot it is. I attached 3 different sizes and shapes of candies to the sticks we use. They have been attached for 3 weeks now and show no sign of letting loose even when shaking them vigorously. I would recommend these for small crafts and will be checking out the larger dots and the glue strips.",5
B0011N832C,After 1 mo the plastic tile I used the dots on all came loose.,4
B0011N832C,"These seem sticky enough to hold things, IF you can keep them from balling-up into tiny useless crumbles .. I guess it takes a special knack, which I eventually got the hang of, though not 100% and not before wasting MANY of the dots .. they should slide off the rolling backing more easily - I found it hard to get them to leave the roll & cling to whatever I was trying to put them on ... and I tried several different material & object types, when attempting to use these dots",3
B0011N832C,"They work, but my but only for awhile. I am will to accept that maybe I am using them wrong. I am hanging an 11x14 poster on the wall and it keeps falling after awhile. I'm not doing anything extensive to prep the wall or anything. This would probably be great for holding picture in place in an album of something.",4
B0011N832C,Used  for  holding balloons together in a balloon garland. The dots are very sticky and worked well .  They are somewhat fussy to get off the strip so one has to be careful with them .  I put them on the wall to hold balloons in place and they were easy to  remove from the wall and didn't damage it.,5
B0011N832C,"Good strength, goes a long way, good price. 10/10",5
B0011N832C,"Once you stick the dot, its hard to get it off the paper it comes on. I've bought dots from different companies before and it was easier. I don't know why these ones are so stubborn. They work just the same, just more obstinate.  Other than that,  they are very sticky!",5
B0011N832C,"I love these.  I have turned into a toy collector lately.  These help them stand up.  I use them for the four Walking Dead figurines I actually took out of the package to hold them to their stands.  They are also good on the Funko Pop dolls that don't stand up, though they don't work on all of the Funko Pop dolls as they heads are so heavy.  A great discovery!",5
B0011N832C,Use these glue dots for so many things. They hold well but then are easily removed too. Amazing!,5
B0011N832C,"If you can get them off the roll cleanly, they do stick but it's a bit of a task to just think you're going to pull away the waxy roll from the sticky dot.",3
B0011N832C,"These glue dots have been the #1 most used item as a homeschool mom.I really can't begin to describe all the things I've used these for from hanging up all the wall decor in our room to crafts, etc. Of all the materials I've tried it on the only one that didn't stick was to my nylon American flag I attempted to hang on the wall. It held the big thing for about half hour. They stayed on the wall just not on the actual flag.",5
B0011N832C,These are the best glue dots I have ever tried..,5
B0011N832C,Great for card making.,5
B0011N832C,These glue dots were very helpful and easy to use while crafting. The only thing I noticed is that you can purchase twice as many for cheaper at Walmart. So many look around before purchasing. These glue dots worked out good for me because I did not have time to go to the store. Very easy to use!,4
B0011N832C,I got these to use for candle making and was not happy with them but used them for other crafts and was very pleased!  I did not have the glue dot adhesive machine but still was able to use these no problem.,4
B0011N832C,"It's a simple product & works well.  I use it for various 4"" x 6"" photos printed by Sam's Club & it's a strong adhesive.. almost too strong.  This stuff may suffice to secure fragile objects on shelves or mantles from falling over, i.e. careless cats or earthquakes, knocking things down & breaking.  I suppose I should try removing a photo that's been ""glue dotted"" to our corkboard as I want to see if the photo gets damaged when gently pulling it off the corkboard.",4
B0011N832C,too small to use easily,3
B0011N832C,These glue dots really hold.  That's why I gave it one star for easy to remove.  They are not supposed to be removed so be careful where you want something to stick.  Follow the directions before using.,5
B0011N832C,I love these for arts & crafts. They are better to work with than glue and hold together well.,5
B0011N832C,"Based on my experience I would recommend choosing one of the options with the dispenser. These were tricky to use off this roll and I think some will go to waste because it unravels too easily. Also for the project I was doing, they weren't very sticky.",4
B0011N832C,"I needed these for my granddaughters birthday present and they arrived super fast, so I was able to make her one present. The price was great and I have a lot left to use for other projects. Thank you.",5
B0011N832C,"I was looking for an adhesive solution to stick my Christmas light onto wood surfaces. Tapes did a terrible job, so was wood glue. These little things saved the day. I learned from an earlier review that you're not supposed to touch the dots as that would turn them into a sticky glob. You need to keep the dots on the paper, and just apply them directly onto the surface. I used the paper to press them on the surface too so no hands were required.",5
B0011N832C,Performance,5
B07WRDQ373,"I have been using this wax for a long time. Always fun to work with, firm and melts very good. Stickers was good for the shape of my candles, and the weight was perfect as well. I last a long time while melting. It does not feel sticky, it is actually very soft.",5
B07WRDQ373,"This is my third time purchasing this brand and my second type of wax and I am in love once again. The wax made my wax melts and tea lights turn out beautifully! I am a fan of the wax beads as I feel they melt easier than the flakes or blocks of wax. Its very easy to work with and holds scent very well. Overall, I am a fan and will continue to use!",5
B07WRDQ373,Easy to use and made amazing candles.i would suggest to friends and family...very satisfied with the product.,5
B07WRDQ373,I kinda wish it came in flakes instead of beads because it clumps up while in the warmer. But I simply use a metal spoon and break it up and it melts easily after that. I love that it's organic. I've used their 10lbs order option twice now and other than the clumping I really have nothing negative to say.,4
B07WRDQ373,"Great wax. I am new to candle making and I decided to purchase this wax for it's all-natural elements and for the fact it is farmed in America- great marketing for my brand.I had to run several test candles before I got the right fragrance and wick combination.First test candle: 8 oz candle in a 3 inch diameter glass jar with an ECO-14 wick (trimmed 1/4""), 8% fragrance, heated to 160 degrees and poured at 160 degrees, stirred fragrance for at least 1 minute,12 days cure time. The fragrance was a little light and the melt pool only reached 98% of the jar. No frosting, very minimal crystallization and wax mostly adhered to glass jar- non-adherence really wasn't that noticeable and crystallization really wasn't that noticeable either.Second test candle: everything the same except used an ECO-16 wick, 10% fragrance, heated to 185 degrees and poured at 160 degrees. Heated glass jar before pouring and stirred fragrance for 2 minutes. Wax adhered to the glass better, the hot throw was stronger and melt pool reached 100%. I had realized I was test burning the candle in a room that was much to large. An 8 oz candle is usually ideal for a 10 ft x 10 ft room. I was test burning in a room 3 times the size. When I put the candle in a 10 ft x 10 ft room with the door open the hot throw was very strong. Almost too strong.Overall, I am happy so far with this wax. I ordered 10 more pounds. Given the nature of pure / nearly pure soy wax, I'm guessing I might have to always use the max fragrance load of 10%, but I would have to do more testing. I have made a few more candles in three other scents (allowed 14 days cure time) and I am mostly happy with two out of three of the hot throws but I think I will try heating the wax to 185 degrees to see if I can get stronger throws, especially for that third fragrance. I am not opposed to mixing paraffin into my soy but so far I do not feel it's necessary, perhaps if I am dyeing the wax I might add paraffin to reduce the crystallization.If you are thinking of purchasing I definitely think this is a good wax to try out. Just make sure you do your research on candle making in general, especially for soy wax (any soy wax).",5
B07WRDQ373,Works good. Easy to use. Does not crack on the top as much as some of the other waxes I have used. Nice that it is microwaveable and the temperature for scent to be put in is lower than most waxes.,5
B07WRDQ373,The wax arrived right on time as expected. I had not used this wax before so I made some wax melts right away. They turned out smooth and smelled great. Now I have to wait a couple weeks for them to cure. Hopefully they will hold their scent. They smell amazing now.,5
B07WRDQ373,This is a high quality wax made in the USA. No odor and it melts very consistently.,5
B07WRDQ373,Pretty good I like this brand,4
B07WRDQ373,Easy to use and holds fragrance well. as beginner candle maker I highly recommend using something like this if you plan on having a candlemaking party or something. You can just pop it in the microwave and it works like a charm,5
B07WRDQ373,I love this wax for making my candles! They burn/ last so long!,5
B07WRDQ373,The smell is hard to to get rid of even when using lots of essential oils. Easy to clean up if you spill,4

B07WRDQ373,This product great and reasonable.,5
B07WRDQ373,Very easy to use,4
B07WRDQ373,"I make regular, small batches of candles: jar candles and tea lights. This wax is easy to use, and burns almost smoke free. I keep my candles burning most of the time, so this is an important feature. This is the fourth order, and it won't be the last.!",5
B07WRDQ373,Bought these as I decided to make candles and these are perfect.,5
B07WRDQ373,Absolutely love this wax,5

B07WRDQ373,This is the second time I have ordered these and I like using it for making my own candles.,5
B07WRDQ373,This wax melts clear and clean and hardens to a nice white color.  I also like the packaging: two five pound bags is much easier handle than a single ten pound bag.,5
B07WRDQ373,Great product arrived on time Great value definitely buy from this seller again and again,5
B07WRDQ373,"Love this wax!!! We are new to candle making and this has been extremely easy to use, wonderful as a candle and we have purchased multiple times!!! Such a great way to have non-toxic candles in your home!",5

B07WRDQ373,"Got Here Fast And I Like That , Especially In My Line of $ Making",5
B07WRDQ373,This melts really well in the microwave with no smell to interfere with my essential oils. Great for the price too.,5
B07WRDQ373,Love this wax better than the other wax I was and have been using. Works a lot better. Glad I found it.,5
B07WRDQ373,I went through a lot of different waxes when creating my candle line but this one won been using for a few years now.,5
B07WRDQ373,Favorite wax to use for myCandle business,5
B07WRDQ373,a high portion of the candkes are cracking and pitting. i am not set up to slow the cooling process more than i already am.beeswax is easier to work with.the pastel colors for easter are lovely with this wax.,3
B07WRDQ373,I love this wax. My candles turned out great!,5
B07WRDQ373,I used this for the first time this past weekend to make candles (I previously used the soy flakes). Not only did my candles come out better than ever but I was able to make this last much longer and make more candles than ever. I will be using this product moving forward and am so impressed with how good it is!,5
B07WRDQ373,Melts great and wax chip dye colors are blending very well,5
B000P0LNRE,Nice look. Easy to grip. Good quality/sharp scissors.,5
B000P0LNRE,"""These scissors are so sharp, I could cut through a diamond if I wanted to. But I won't, because that would be wasteful.

B000P0LNRE,"These are my go-to for household scissors. They're sturdy and sharp with comfortable handles. Every time my family manages to ruin or lose a pair, I order another set and hide them for as long as I can, lol!",5
B000P0LNRE,Nice pair of scissors they have a comfortable handle and are nice and sharp. My only complaint is I put one pair outside in my shed and they rusted rather quickly. The other pair that I have inside are in excellent shape,4
B000P0LNRE,these scissors are good,5
B000P0LNRE,Great Value Scissors. I use them for basic household cutting needs and they last a long time and are usually priced well.,5

B000P0LNRE,I should have paid attention to the size of the handles. A bit small.,5
B000P0LNRE,"These scissors are very sharp and cut easily. I purchased these to replace some old kitchen scissors. The quality of these is so much better than any other scissors I have owned. I actually cut right through some plastic packaging into my finger today. The scissors handle tasks so easily that I am not used to it. With blades this sharp, you really do not need to exert much effort to cut open packages or food items.",5

I tried sharpening the old brand but that didn't work out so well.So, I looked around Amazon (who looks anywhere else?) for a pair of good scissors and this brand popped up. I bought them and am really impressed with how sharp they are. Maybe I just wasn't used to sharp scissors after using the old pair for 10 years.These have a good hand-feel, balance, and satisfying cutting sound. Makes me happy and my bubble wrap is happy too. And you get two pairs for the same price as one pair of the ""Other Name Brand"". Can't lose. Buy them. Now.Recommended.",5
B000P0LNRE,I use these at work - they are really sharp and have held up great so I bought some for home too!,5

B000P0LNRE,Love these. These work well and last long,5
B000P0LNRE,"Why buy one scissor when you can get two? Current scissors at home were getting dull. They were really only good for opening boxes. Try to cut something? Not going to happen without causing bodily harm to self or others. These scissors worked on the first try, right out of the box. Batteries not required. No need to sharpen or charge before using. 8 out of 10 would recommend. The other 2 out of 10 are probably left handed.",5

B000P0LNRE,"These things are sharp, they cut really well. Bought them when I couldn't find the last pair I bought, then found them after these came in.  Now I have four of these... No complaints.",5
B000P0LNRE,I was pleasantly surprised that these scissors were so sharp. They cut everything from paper to thick cardboard with ease,5
B000P0LNRE,As advertised,5
B000P0LNRE,"Sharp, do the job.",5
B000P0LNRE,Solid product!,5
B000P0LNRE,"I totally like them. Strong, cut super well, feel good in my hand. Good deal besides on 2.",5
B000P0LNRE,"I feel bad for giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, but there were just a few shortcomings.  I'm not sure if it's just due to them being heavy duty, but I found the handles just a tiny bit uncomfortable on the inner portions when holding them.  For paying 10-30% more than a lot of the more standard brands like Fiskars I guess I was expecting things to be smoother, but I don't hate them.  I am used to handles having a flatter and smoother interior, rather than a very pronounced hard plastic ridge.The second ding, and most annoying, is there's a nick in the blade that makes it catch each time it goes over.  I can live with it, but again, it's annoying to have in brand new scissors.-----Bad stuff out of the way, I am really happy to have lefty scissors!  I waited an embarrassingly long time to buy my first pair, and was slightly shocked at how easy it is to cut a near-perfectly straight line along the edge of stuff.  I wish I could gift my grade or high school-aged self a pair of these.If you're wondering if these will work for you, they really are decently heavy duty.  If you have arthritis or especially small hands you may not find these very comfortable.  I can comfortably fit all four fingers through the handle, but if you have larger fingers it might only fit three.  Perhaps that's the normal way for large-handed people to hold scissors.For anyone hunting for any brand of scissors designed for left-handedness, note that for it to qualify both the handles need to be mirrored, and when you are holding it the inward facing blade should be on the bottom.  Basically left scissors have the left blade move upwards, right scissors have the right blade move upward.  Some brands do one but not the other, this brand meets both qualifications.I would probably go with a slightly smaller, cheaper, less heavy-duty pair for my next purchase, but I will keep and enjoy these.",4
B000P0LNRE,"They work great for a variety of tasks.  I like the yellow handles--easier to spot in the ""junk"" drawer!",5
B000P0LNRE,"These are great, they are heavy and really sharp.",5
B000P0LNRE,Very sharp & very sturdy!  These are made to last a long time.  Would buy again.,5
B000P0LNRE,"My kids kept taking the scissors we had from our ""junk drawer"" in the kitchen. In answer to this I bought more scissors. Those too were taken. What was I to do? I bought MORE scissors, THESE scissors... but I didn't put them in the kitchen. THERE lies the genius! I put them in one of my office drawers instead. Now it will be at least a couple weeks before they find them! Ha! They are great quality, comfortable to use, and very sharp. I'll definitely be ordering them again once my kids take these scissors away!",5
B000P0LNRE,Sharp; A little stiff,4
B000P0LNRE,These work well and stay sharp a very long time.,5
B000P0LNRE,"After many years of using my grandparents old scissors, they finally broke one day! I went on Amazon and looked up durable scissors and came about this product so I ordered it. Come to find out it comes with a pair of scissors instead of just one.The fit was amazing on the hands. I loved the color of the scissors as well. I have used these scissors to cut open boxes, some food items and etc. They have been amazing and very sharp to get the job done.Highly recommend to anyone looking for durable scissors.Link to purchase: https://amzn.to/3Wf1A4v",5
B000P0LNRE,Love these - work great.,5
B000P0LNRE,Love the scissors.  Very sharp and easy to hold,5
B000P0LNRE,Very affordable and very sturdy for cutting things in a daily life,5
B000P0LNRE,Every left handed person needs this. Great quality at a great price,5
B000P0LNRE,"Tough, have had them for 3 years and they are still sharp.",5
B000P0LNRE,I love these scissors. They are razor sharp and are the best that I have ever owned. Very happy with this purchase,5
B000P0LNRE,"Nice touch making these a 2 pack. Leave one on your desk that your coworkers are going to borrow to cut wire, open boxes, clean under their fingernails, and put the pair you use in a locking drawer.  Color is a nice comforting government office gray with a little flash of brightness, like a new young unpaid intern who thinks they are going to fix everything and be the CEO in under 3 years. Grip is comfortable even for large hands, and cutting paper is easy with clean edges. Size is a little big but they work well and are easy to open and close.",4
B000P0LNRE,Beautiful in appearance,5
B000P0LNRE,Better and sharper than I expected,5
B000P0LNRE,My first pair lasted me 20 years! Didn't hesitate to buy a 2-pair set.The rubber on the grips will eventually crack and become annoying to use the tool. Just figure that 20 years from now you will be replacing them! ROFL,5
B000P0LNRE,"Recommend these scissors, they keep a sharp edge over time and are very reasonably priced.",5
B000P0LNRE,"I expected these scissors to be sharper given the material, but they are not",3
B000P0LNRE,Great product.  Much heavier duty than I was expecting doe this price range.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a respectable pair of office scissors.No cheap feel about this product.,5
B000P0LNRE,Good value,5
B000P0LNRE,"I've been using these scissors for four years, and I find them incredibly useful. Unlike other brands, they don't become dull after a period of use. That's why I highly recommend them.",5
B000P0LNRE,"The Amazon barcode label clearly says these are for lefties, but the manufacturer's packaging does not. I believe The Mega Deals is intentionally selling the wrong scissors at just one penny off the price (in hopes that people won't return them) so that the product sold directly by Amazon cannot have the buy box.The problem with this bait and switch is that these are the types of scissors you can ONLY use left- or right-handed - the grips are contoured to the hands, so using the wrong one will be painful and awkward.I've purchased the item sold by Amazon, and will let you know if they are the correct scissors.UPDATE: The scissors sold by Amazon are lefty scissors! You can see ""lefty"" on the packaging. Make sure to buy only those, because they're great scissors.UPDATE UPDATE: Seriously. These scissors are AMAZING. I've bought 4 because I want a pair everywhere I use scissors. I cut through 100pt paperboard (the stuff hardback book covers are made of) to make a reusable sewing pattern. Although my hand is killing me, it worked! Clean cuts, smooth edges. Don't try to cut to the middle of the board (cut off small pieces at a time; the board doesn't bend) and watch out for curves. I'd have used purpose-built shears, but they don't exist for lefties :/ These got the job done.",5
B000P0LNRE,"good. product, everything as described",5
B000P0LNRE,I keep pairs of these in various places around the house. They're good value for the money and do the job well. They feel good in the hand and stay sharp for quite a while.,5
B000P0LNRE,"I have had a pair of these exact same scissors for about 15 years. They are still great scissors. When I started to work more from home, I decided to create an actual home office. I needed scissors for my new home office. I didn't even think twice about purchasing the same scissors I already use on a regular basis. I could not believe what a value I found in this two-pack. I am trusting these will last 15+ years like the ones I already have.",5
B000P0LNRE,These replace the same scissors that I had for thirty years. The plastic in the handle started to separate.,5
B000P0LNRE,"For what we paid, they're good scissors. They seem to stay sharp, they're easy and comfortable to hold, and so far the lifetime warranty seems to be upheld.One of the handles split out along the long edge; we tried to superglue it back together however the handle material is VERY anti-stick somehow and glue wouldn't hold it in the slightest. We found the online form to submit a warranty claim, along with a picture of the broken handle and our Amazon invoice / receipt. About six weeks later we had a new pair of scissors arrive at our doorstep in plain brown packaging.I wish they hadn't broke, yet at the same time, we did get a replacement set. Fair enough, I suppose.",4
B06XRDBGY6,"This little leather punch turned into the best investment for the money (Cyber Monday sale with an insane discount) I've made in a very long time.I'm currently working on finishing a ""fursuit"", one that involves literally hundreds of grommets and rivets.  The material I was working with was broadcloth and  Kona cotton, glued together with hot-glue.  The broadcloth was the trim, with the cotton making up the bulk of the tunic.  It was being punched through three layers of the broadcloth and one layer of the cotton.For the larger holes needed for the grommets, I used the 4.5mm hole, which is (barely) large enough for my needs.  I was ""satisfied"" by the results, since the punch worked most of the time, and the rest can be teased out with a well-sharpened #11 blade.  But of the 520 holes I needed to make in total, only 90 of them were for the eyelets, so I'm OK with that.But for the rivets...  It's AWESOME!  Full penetration and material removal for EVERY HOLE.  For the math-challenged, that's 430 holes in total and all of the material was removed, leaving daylight showing through and no need for using an awl to expand the holes for the rivets.Moreover, the ability to chomp through from hole to hole without twisting, realigning or the hand fatigue from a hand-held leather punch was butter smooth and that process was FAST, taking 2/3 the time for twice the number of grommet holes I punched.520 holes in under an hour, all perfectly spaced, with 430 of them, and the majority of the other 90 needing NOTHING to mess with.This being on fabric makes it even more compelling if your case-use is for leather.  It's lightning quick and amazingly efficient with leather, even better than fabric.  If you're still tearing your hand up on the hand-held model (which was a variant on this type for sale on the site when I bought this,  I already had that hurts my hand now), I can assure you that your hand will love you for this thing.Your arm, maybe not so much, but the leverage this applies is more than sufficient reason to forgive a somewhat sore arm.  (And after 520 holes, something's going to be complaining about that if not just darkly muttering in a corner).This will be REPLACING my leather punches for everything it can reach.  It's relatively quiet, very fast, easy to use, accurate as hell and I can't be more pleased that I got it on a Cyber Monday sale with same-day delivery.Even if you can't get that deal on it now, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to EVERYONE who's serious about their crafting.  This was instrumental in reducing my hand fatigue, and keeping my apartment neighbors from pounding the walls by using a manual hammer-and-punch approach (which was my second option).  Plus it did the job faster than a hammer and punch could possibly do.  I don't recall the ""full price"" on this, but it's sturdy enough and functional enough in all the important ways, to consider as a worthy investment and addition to any maker's/crafter's tool kit.I DO NOT gush about tools very often.  Very few ever live up to my high expectations.  But this thing turned a dreaded step in a very long and complicated build of a fursuit into a dream in speed, silence, efficiency and functionality, and I can't give it more kudos than that.  I give 4 stars to what I really like.  I only give 5 stars when I have  no reservations, no down-check, not provisions, no hesitation, to endorse a product.If you need a rotatory leather punch, GET THIS!  Your life will be much happier using this than ANYTHING that fits in one hand.",5
B06XRDBGY6,"Love this tool, works great, easy to use, thank you.",5
B06XRDBGY6,I recently lost a lot of weight and all my leather work belts are too big. Got this to put new holes in it because it was way cheaper than buying new belts. It works well and was easy to use. The holes are perfect and the kit comes with everything you need. Definitely worth it,5
B06XRDBGY6,"Its usage seemed straight forward but a manual would have helped my first time using it.  The wheel that selected the hole sizes, for example, move so stiffly and only in one direction that I thought I need to loosen a screw with the little screwdriver that was provided.  No, just need to spin in the right direction with a lot of force.  What of the little rat-tail file?  I guess it is to dress up the edge of the new hole.  It also came with replacement anvils, which I imagine are soft copper so not to dull the punch after many uses.  I would be nice if this was spilled out.  But despite the confusion, it easily punched a neat and precise hole in my belt.  It also seem well built and if taken care of will last a long time.  It is a same I felt the need to debit it a star because of the lack of a manual.",4
B06XRDBGY6,Punches right through the thick tarp I have.  Built well.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"Works great, much better quality than the ""hammering"" type which I returned. One note, you may have to double up very thin fabric, which I did with Faraday cloth that I use for a Ham radio ground plane. I had intended to do so anyway for added strength. Anything like a tarp or similar will work fine single thickness.",5
B06XRDBGY6,"Works great, pops through leather liker butter,  maybe margarine? I've already punched multiple holes in belts and guitar straps. Great price for a good tool, overall great transaction.",5
B06XRDBGY6,We grabbed these to use at the barn to adjust stirrups. They work great both on leather saddles and synthetic. They punch holes fairly easily and in general have kept up for us at the barn which is great.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"I liked that there were pictures along with the written instructions. However the text was so small, I had tremendous difficulty reading it. Its punch ability was inconsistent even when used on the same material or fabric. Overall, though, it was perfect for the book marks I made and was able to successfully thread tassels through the 4.5mm punch.",4
B06XRDBGY6,Works well on my flip over tent but did not cut all the way and some did not pinch strong enough to hold the fabric.,4
B06XRDBGY6,"Very sturdy, making the holes with little effort.It would have been 5 stars if the changing of the sizes would have been easier plus bigger holes. Most holes are pretty small.",4
B06XRDBGY6,It works. It is a bit large but it works well.,5
B06XRDBGY6,Perfect tool with different sized punches. Definitely recommend!,5
B06XRDBGY6,Excellent item!,5
B06XRDBGY6,Very sturdy and works well.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"I haven't used it as yet, but in trying it out it worked well. My only complaint is it did not have a plastic or vinyl case to keep it in. I could have sworn a case to keep it in was shown, but I certainly could be wrong!",4
B06XRDBGY6,Awesome tools,5
B06XRDBGY6,"A plus, must have in the tool box for all purposes!",5
B06XRDBGY6,Good,5
B06XRDBGY6,"As I said, it works, and seems well made. I tried it on a leather belt, and the hole was clean. Two minor comments. Like I said, the instructions are so tiny I literally had to use a magnifying glass to read them. And they aren't really complete, no mention of the included file or the small bag of plastic covers. Not sure how I'm supposed to use them.",4
B06XRDBGY6,As described,5
B06XRDBGY6,"The punch works very well but the manual needs some work. For example, the brass pad was preinstalled with the brass incorrectly positioned. The manual says nothing about it so you have to rely on the photos in the Amazon product page because there are none in the manual.",4
B06XRDBGY6,Works great putting holes in leather belts.,5
B06XRDBGY6,High quality. Seems to work well,5
B06XRDBGY6,Nice and sharp! Cut thru thicknesses of fabric easily so I could put rivets,5
B06XRDBGY6,Put it to use as soon as it was unpackaged. Its a necessary too even for those who may only use once or twice. The price was great considering its instant utility.,5
B06XRDBGY6,Works great and easy to use,5
B06XRDBGY6,I lost 32 pounds giving up diet soda as well as light beer.My belts were too big but this device help me use my big belts on my more slender waist. This device help is a money saver!,5

And then I went on to fix my Birkenstocks as well very happy with this product works very easily even if you were like the weakest person in the world you can use this item. Very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"The puncher works perfectly. Leaves a nice, clean hole punched.  One larger hole size and one less tiny hole size would be great.",5
B06XRDBGY6,I have lost 15 lbs and needed to add a couple holes in my belt!,5
B06XRDBGY6,"Has a well made, stout feel to it. Easily punches holes in thicker leather.  Just getting started working with leather. Used it to punch holes in belts made from thicker leather. Easily punched clean holes.",5
B06XRDBGY6,This product worked perfectly! I just used it to put eight additional holes in three different leather belts and using it was seamless and easy.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"does what it says! A little difficult turning the punches. Maybe just so new. I liked the product nd saved about 40 bucks the first time I use it, Now have 13 belts.",4
B06XRDBGY6,"Great quality. Nice, clean punches",5
B06XRDBGY6,This worked perfectly to make extra holes on my belts and purses. Good price too!,5

B06XRDBGY6,This unit works very good.  No problems making the hole in the belts.,5
B06XRDBGY6,Easily add more holes to favorite belts. Works great - very functional. Do recommend,5
B06XRDBGY6,"I bought this to make holes in embroidered gift tags and bags and it has worked out great. It cuts through the multiple layers of fabric I often have sandwiched together, and it doesn't cramp my hand or fingers.",5
B06XRDBGY6,Very easy to use. No complaints at all.,5
B06XRDBGY6,I bought this because my husband and I are dieting and I wanted to continue using the belts we have for a bit longer.  I also do crafting and this will come in handy when I make my tiny belts.,5

B06XRDBGY6,Good quality and no complaints so far!,5
B06XRDBGY6,Punching through leather can be hard if you don't have the hand strength to squeeze hard.This leather punch is easy to set up so it is stable for you to push down on the handle to make the hole.I used it to make an extra hole in several leather belts.,5
B06XRDBGY6,Always wanted to get one of these. Saves me trips to my local shoe repair shop.,5
B06XRDBGY6,Excellent tool and so easy to use- highly recommend!!!,5

B06XRDBGY6,Loved this!  It works great and has many belt hole settings,5
B06XRDBGY6,"I needed to shorten the leather strap on a new purse. Was nervous because it's a designer purse. It was so easy, and the hole size is perfect. Love that it has various sizes of hole puncher. And, it cut clean.",5
B06XRDBGY6,"This hole punch seems well built and sturdy, like it will last a long time.  But it's hard to turn the ""selector"" wheel to put the size you want into the punching position, and it's hard to press it hard enough to punch a clean hole.",3
B06XRDBGY6,Perfect for belts and Watch strap. Precise,5
B06XRDBGY6,"Ease of use ,ease of cleaning one of the best.",5
B06XRDBGY6,"Product arrived well packaged. Looks sturdy,  I am excited about options for shape & size of holes. Have not used product yet, but plan to try it out soon, as I have several leather belts that need an additional hole or two .  Will try to make an addendum note after trying out the XOOL Hole Puncher.",4
B06XRDBGY6,Much easier to use than hand plier punch style. I use frequently in my leatherwork.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"I like the product because it is easy to use, accurate, and sturdy.",5
B06XRDBGY6,Easy to use and should last a long time,5
B06XRDBGY6,I would recommend this tool for anyone who dabbles in leather work.,5
B06XRDBGY6,"I needed to punch holes in a stack of photos to make calendars. I had used a hand punch previously, which only allowed me to punch one at a time. But when I saw this tool and its stable configuration, I ordered it immediately. I was not disappointed; I was able to punch multiple sheets quickly.",5
B06XRDBGY6,"You can barely fit the washer and grommet into the tool. Not much room.. and I have small hands. I have to squeeze the heck out of it for it to be tight. And the punch doesn't cut through anything. It left only a ring marking on my 4 layers of vinyl (the corner of a vinyl banner) after I put a mallet to it and I ended up using an exacto knife to cut out my hole.It is durable though. Nice and solid tool. Just doesn't function well and the hole punch sucks.I didn't get to use it within the return time frame.. otherwise I would have returned it. I'm stuck with a tool I will never use again.*UPDATE* After my post, the seller reached out to me and refunded me my money. They didn't have to do that but they did. So I raised my star rating up.",3
B06XRDBGY6,It works well  for my need,4
B06XRDBGY6,I needed to punch some holes in a leather book cover and it did that well.  I can recommend this supplier.,5
B086L1CDMT,"This is a fun kit and not difficult to use. My son loves different types of crafting--I don't know anything about resin, but he asked me to order some. This looked like a good kit and was a good price and I'm pleased with the results. We ordered a mold for him to make some dice and they turned out great! He put a few different small items in the resin, and it was fun to see how the different ones turned out. This dried pretty quickly, less than 24 hours.",5
B086L1CDMT,"Clear, quick cure , fast drying. Value priced for this great quality resin.",5
B086L1CDMT,This is my first time trying to make anything out of resin. This worked well. They are very hard and very clear. Pretty,5
B086L1CDMT,Great results for my first time using epoxy. Easy to follow instructions. Was exactly enough to make the 3 paddles pictured. Only complaint is the measuring cups were too small at 1 oz.  Had to pour a few times just to make 8-10 oz of solution per paddle. Product dried clear and shiny. Ordering more to make more paddles.,4
B086L1CDMT,"I needed a low viscosity resin to inject into small plastic tubes to reinforce them and this did a fantastic job. I had well over 40 min work time in a 70 degree room and the resin self leveled and degassed to clear without issue. If you're using more than 10ml you might want to vacuum it to help the bubbles move but I was still impressed by how much it could degas on its own. It also stays fairly cool while curing which could help with some molds and applications.It does take a good 30 hours to fully set so if you have something that you want to keep crystal clear make sure to put it in a dust free container before it cures and keep it somewhere that's at least 60 degrees. It might go faster if you heat it up but I'd rather have no cracking or hazing over fast cure. I also wouldn't use this for repairs, just casting, due to the long cure time and low tack until it starts to cure. Really this is casting resin for molds, not river tables, so if you're need it for an application like that look at pouring resins instead.",5
B086L1CDMT,"Much bigger than my expectations. Easy to use. I use this to fix my broken drawers of cabinets. One night , firm fixed.",5
B086L1CDMT,"Total disclosure: I'm an intermediate level modeler using silicone molds and epoxy resin. Not novice, but far from expert. With that said I am very impressed with this product. Other models came out of the mold foggy and needed ALOT of finishing attention using 1500 and 2000 grade sand papers and polishers. This product came out like glass. There are quite a few tiny bubbles, but im sure they are present due to my level of experience. This was a difficult project that required several attempts, ultimately requiring the mold to be made, led strips to be glued to the mold then the epoxy poured into the mold so that the strips would be embedded in the model, instead of carving a led strip channel with my dremel after their model was formed. I'm VERY pleased with the outcome.The pic shows the model right after demolding. No finishing work has been done yet. The fact that you can see the bubbles so clearly is a testament to how clear this epoxy comes out.",5
B086L1CDMT,This was a decent price and nice amount of epoxy. I though it worked fairly well and I do like the 1:1 ratio. I didn't think it was great with self leveling and not exactly no bubble. I can't say about yellowing because I tinted all mine so you can't tell.,3
B086L1CDMT,"The resin is as described except for one thing, it is flammable. This is contrary to the label on the front of the bottles which says ""Non flammable"". When I was using a lighter to pop the bubbles, it suddenly lit on fire. Luckily, It was only a small surface that lit on fire, but it was still scary. Don't use flame near it!",4
B086L1CDMT,Works good like anything else it takes time to learn but this cures nice and usually no bubbles if correct steps are taken.,5
B086L1CDMT,Great product for our projects.Fast shipping.,5
B086L1CDMT,Larger than expected. Worked great. All the supplies you need included.,5
B086L1CDMT,Was making a mini rc drift course for the kiddo and this made a perfect top coat for it to create the perfect smooth surface.  Was ablke to put the full track design under and create a realistic look with capable survive for the 1/64 rc drift car,5
B086L1CDMT,"Purchased to make home made ornaments with photos encapsulated in the resin; did not disappoint. Low odor, making indoor project work a breeze. Particularly love the extra tapered pour caps!  Will buy only this for future resin projects!",5
B086L1CDMT,Waiting for the holidays to be over. It arrived on time and just as described.,4
B086L1CDMT,First timer.,5
B086L1CDMT,"This product is great for any small size DIY projects, and I have been using it for a few months now. The epoxy dries fast and is very durable.",5
B086L1CDMT,This is my first time using resin and making dice. I am amazed at the clarity.The only thing I would knock is that the bit I left out to cure (extra resin in a cup) so I could compare to the dice in my pressure pot was still super bendy after 24 hours. That might be because it was a small piece so it wasn't having the exothermic reaction but I'm not sure.The dice came out perfectly hard.,4
B086L1CDMT,"I was surprised with this resin. I love it, it dries fast. It's nice and hard and not sticky.",5
B086L1CDMT,"This epoxy resin is easy to use as a beginner and definitely works as intended. I'm new to this, so I wasn't able to get all the bubbles out, but there are fewer bubbles than I get in UV resin for sure.Be aware that you're supposed to measure this by volume and not weight - I do a lot of crafts so I figured I knew how to use this and didn't need to read the directions (had watched some videos in preparation), and once I finished I flipped through the manual and realized I had measured the wrong way, haha. The difference in weight vs volume seems to be minimal, so my shaker charms still came out fine.I assumed that the resin would be cured enough to lift from the mold in 4-6 hours, as I saw in some videos, but it needs a good 12 to de-mold for sure. It says 18-24 hours to fully cure, in case you were wondering, and 4-6 to cure enough to pour another layer on top of it. So, read the directions before using! Lol",5
B086L1CDMT,"Self leveling, few bubbles even if you mix aggressively, takes ink and resin beautifully, absolutely crystal clear, no odor. The smaller bottled come with a tip to reduce mess, the larger ones are a little trickier but not awful. This resin is a great price compared to some of the name brands that are harder to work with. The bottle are easy to hold, but i also have larger hands for a woman. I use this for casting rune sets mainly so am unsure how it does with a deep pour. I generally cast 3 layers in each set so they are prety thin.",5
B086L1CDMT,"I'm totally new at using this and I'm happy with the outcome! I read the directions a few times just to get a clear understanding, then followed them. My project of 4 key chains turned out wonderfully.  After it sat for a a hour, I just had to touch one, and yes, my fingerprint was left in it. lol. I woke up the next morning and my project was hard, and I was so proud!Today I purchased some dried flowers and some coaster trays for my next project. I've been looking at videos all afternoon. I just wanted to check and see if I should pour a layer and let it dry before adding the flowers, but couldn't find an answer. I guess I'll have to experiment.I'm happy with this and will purchase again. There were no air bubbles and it leveled off. I even added glitter to the mix. Like the directions stated, use in a well ventilated room. The scent is not loud, but be  downstairs did have a chemical smell in the air. My only question is measuring. How does one know how much product to use? I used four ounces and that was to much and I threw the excess away. Again, I'll have to experiment. Overall  I'm happy!",5
B086L1CDMT,"It is oderless.The manual said to cure in 4 hours, but I had to tape it overnight before touching it again. I want something which sets in at most hours. I have no complaints other than this.",3
B086L1CDMT,"This product gave varying results. Before you start to think it's from inexperience,  I measured exact same of A&B, and stirred thoroughly. The exact same batch with the exact same additives gave me one perfectly cured result and one flexible sticky result.",3
B086L1CDMT,"Epoxy is pretty much ... epoxy. This particular epoxy mixes clear unless you choose to add colorants. Its cure time is listed as 24 hours, which gives you time to watch for and correct drips. I used the product to ""rot-doctor"" some water-damaged cedar ceiling boards that were disintegrating. Coated with this epoxy, the wood was stabilized and secured in place. The epoxy is thin enough to be applied with a brush or injected using a large-gauge syringe. I haven't used this as a pouring/encapsulating product yet, but I expect that it will work well in that application, too.",5
B086L1CDMT,"I used this product for several projects. A lamp made out of an old motor armature and small paperweights with insects or flowers in.It flows well with minimum bubbles. It does have a limited shelf life, so best to use it within a few months.",5
B086L1CDMT,The measuring cups were shattered but everything else is fine. I have my own measuring cups but a first time resin user would need the cups in tact.,3
B086L1CDMT,"Worked very well. A little warm as it cured, but used in a hard plastic pot which tolerated it fine.  I still have half of it left, onto another project. Thx",5
B086L1CDMT,Muy bueno  gracias,4
B086L1CDMT,Did the job,5
B086L1CDMT,Great results for first time user,4
B086L1CDMT,"Used for a multitude of castings and bonding pieces. When prepared properly, it cures with excellent clarity and provides decent work time. Good consistency as well, the mixed product particularly when warm is relatively thin for a resin, allowing it to fill tiny and intricate spaces. Also thin enough to be easily used with a dropper, something I've struggled with in other resins. The kit I received also came with alternate dispenser caps, which I've found quite handy when only needing small amounts. All in all, one of the best craft resins I've used.",5
B086L1CDMT,"I used the epoxy to set a claw, into a metal cap like I have done 100's of times over the years with different quick epoxy resins...This was mixed correctly....and never hardened...that usually happens with old product , I gave a one star rating after this happenedUPDATE: After the manufacturer reached out to me, and offered replacement ...things are much better. The new batch sets up as it should, and is a good product...things happen, and I may have just received a bad batch the first timeAll in all, happy with this product, and will buy from these vendors again in the future...they offered wonderful customer service...Rating has been changed to 5 stars due to the wonderful customer service.",5
B086L1CDMT,"Good product, had no problem using this product and works as they said it would.",5
B086L1CDMT,"This product says casting resin but it is not you can only pour 1/4 inch thickness at a time which makes it a tabletop resin..you should be able to cast a mold with a casting resin..i doubt many people want to pour a 1inch by 1inch mold in 4 pours. But i am giving this product 4 stars because this company reached out without me contacting them and sent one to try again and stated it will support up to 1 1/4in pours they also offered me a full refund which i am not taking because i will end up using it for thin pours, i just wish it wasnt labeled as casting resin..but the company did make the effort, which so many do not and i appreciate it",4
B086L1CDMT,"I'm use to dealing with the UV resin for jewelry molds, which aren't that deep, so I was a little worried about using this. I was worried for nothing! Seems pretty clear, but I used colorants in my stuff. I also had zero exothermic reactions, no odor and easy to poor. I was making chess pieces and they cured within 24 hrs. Would definitely buy this again!",5
B086L1CDMT,"This easy resin is a pleasure to work with. It mixes easily, with  no odor, and it cures well, with minimal bubbles.",5
B086L1CDMT,Easy to work with and comes with accesories to make the process easier.,5
B086L1CDMT,Will use it to coat a few wooden handles for pots.,5
B086L1CDMT,"So, I purchased this to make a casting of a clear screen cover for a project. I had a mold that I 3D printed for the part I needed. I admit, the resulting casting is super clear, BUT... I asked Amazon's help AI system (where in the past I could ask a question that posted to other people who bought this product) about a release agent. It said none was needed, as the resin shouldn't stick to ""anything"", or so it said... Well, it stuck to my plastic mold so strongly that I couldn't remove the casting. Just a heads up, get a silicone molding plastic or putty to make your mold with, or get a release agent.",3
B086L1CDMT,Great resin for the money.,5
B086L1CDMT,12 year old granddaughter uses this for craft projects and loves it,5
B086L1CDMT,Best,5
B086L1CDMT,This is the best epoxy! Hardly any odor and after slowly mixing it for about three minutes at 72 degrees it poured easily and I was amazed to see no bubbles.,5
B086L1CDMT,"I used this for fly rod repair, it worked fine, but another product worked much better..",4
B086L1CDMT,"Great resin for beginners, very clear, easy to mix, but has a strong odor.",5
B086L1CDMT,Works as well as any two part epoxy,5
B086L1CDMT,"Amendment:Seller worked with me on my issues. Moved them up from 3 stars to 5 stars for stellar feedback and help. I wouldn't have asked for anything but they offered. That means a lot; at least, to me. I would suggest only using this for intended purposes for best results.First review:Works well for epoxy. Nice and clear. BUT... I can't get this to stop fish eyeing. Hardest I have ever worked with epoxy. I am trying to cover a canvas with this and it always seems to fish eye. I have the price in a room away from oil and contamination. I have tried clear coating first. I have tried painting over with clear acrylics. I have tried several times to repour on top of the first fish eyed coat and it fish eyes on the fish eyes and over where it covered the previous time. I cleaned the canvas like I would before painting and quite a combination of these things. This stuff just doesn't want to be smooth.",5
B086L1CDMT,"This does not set up. I poured it over a week ago and it has yet to set up firmly. What a waste of money, will never buy this again. Update: the company reached out to me and sent me some new resin. The customer service was excellent and I am grateful for them reaching out to me and making things right. I have get to try it out again but if all goes well I would purchase it again.",3
B086L1CDMT,"A previous homeowner gouged out a part of the soap stone sink on the other side and any sink stopper installed would leak, used this epoxy and the results are fantastic!",5
B086L1CDMT,"Slid a piece of thin metal rod down the shaft of the rod, rejoined the pieces, wrapped in thread and finished with a couple coats of this. Looks nice and smooth and most importantly restored this snapped rod tip to working order. Thanks!",5
B086L1CDMT,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I honestly dont have one single complaint about my experience with using this resin. I made an A for my daughter's bedroom the day it was delivered and for as thick as the mold is, it cured within 2 days and is ROCK hard. It mixed very well, any air bubbles that developed while mixing raised to the surface and popped on their own, and I can't get over how crystal clear the resin is. It looks like glass or something. It's absolutely incredible.I apologize, I actually do have one thing that I think could be improved now that I am thinking about it. After I was done pouring and was getting ready to put the caps back on, I somehow mixed them up and now I can't get either one of my bottles open lmao. I must've put the hardner cap on the resin bottle & vice versa. So maybe the lids could be color coded or something!",5
B086L1CDMT,"I bought this to make a ""pond"" for a commissioned dinosaur diorama. My pros and cons are as follows:Pros:-Very minimal bubbles in the pours, easily removeable with heat-Low odor-Very easy to mix-Was able to use transparent dyes with no issue-Evens out on its own very well-For the money, you're getting a very generous amount of epoxy resinCons-Long cure timeTips-Any epoxy resins can be subject to lose workability due to shelf life or extreme weather temps. When you get a batch of epoxy resin, make a very small test pour to make sure your kit will cure properly.-Get some silicone measuring cups. These are washable and reusable, so you won't be wasting money going through plastic mixing cups.-If you need a thick layer of resin, like my project which called for nearly an inch of resin for a water effect, pour in small, even sessions and make a new layer after the previous has cured.-If using dyes, test a small batch first. Some colors or ratios may cause the resin to cure improperly or not at all. A little dye usually goes a long way, so a few drops are usually all you need, unless you're looking for a certain effect. In that case, make sure you get a resin compatible with your dyes, and vice versa.-Epoxy resins need to be mixed THOROUGHLY. Scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing cup several times while stirring. Mixing an extra minute or so doesn't hurt either.Overall, great stuff. I've bought it twice now with no issues so far.",5
B086L1CDMT,This was perfect for my project!!!,5
B086L1CDMT,I'm new to resin epoxy art projects. It's been trial and error. But this is the third brand I've tried. It's ok. It's the easiest to use so far. What I don't like is that it doesn't seem to set as firm. The product (I tried bookmarks) were very bendable.,3
B086L1CDMT,muy bien,5
B086L1CDMT,"What I liked about this resin is that it comes with a booklet of instructions, when cured the final product is crystal clear, and there are few bubbles, many of which can be removed with a butane torch.  What I was disappointed in was that the resin did not cure flat.  There was a swirl-like pattern that appeared at the surface when cured--this can be seen from certain angles but not necessarily straight-on.  Also, it has been 4 days and while the surface is mostly cured, the bottom sides of the silicone molds are still wet.  The instructions said the resin would cure in 24-48 hours, but that was not the case in my project.",3
B086L1CDMT,This is the second batch of resin bought for mine and my partner's dice making adventures and we are both blow away by the quality.The resin is so much clearer and brighter than our first batch by a different company that we didn't know there could be a clearer and brighter resin out there but we were proven wrong by this brand.We will happily buy more in the future for our clear dice/lightly colored clear dice.Very very happy with this purchase!,5
B086L1CDMT,I used this to make a graduation gift for my granddaughter.  This was so easy to use. I think the best part was the leveling out of the resin once it is poured into the mold. I was amazed at how quickly not only did it level out but 90% of the bubbles disappeared as I was pouring.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future.,5
B086L1CDMT,Stop okay let me tell you I have never used resin before and this has made it so easy to use  I have never had any issues with it and it's just like it States no oder or bubbles and it has a perfect clear look when it'd finished curing. Depending on what size you pick it will work for whatever you need it to. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT,5
B086L1CDMT,First time using epoxy and directions were easy enough.Love kits that come with everything you need.,5
B086L1CDMT,Great price!,5
B086L1CDMT,"I've used lots of resins, and this one was cheaper than many others I've used. But it worked well for a small project.",5
B086L1CDMT,One of the bottles came in and the foil top was busted and a quarter of the liquid had drained off in the box and got everything sticky. Haven't even used it yet so I don't know how well it works but not off to a good startUpdate *** after reading my review Emma from their customer service department reached out to me apologizing for the leaking bottle and offered to send a replacement. Not only did they send a replacement they sent a larger set than the one I purchased. After using I've got bubbles but that's user error due to this being my first try at epoxy. It's very easy to pour and seems like it will be very clear once i work out my own issues. Customer service is top notch. Would recommend,5
B086L1CDMT,"Used this to make resin crafts and apply to canvas.  Easy to use, loved the gloves and mixing sticks and cups.  Dried perfectly and as perfect as I envisioned.",5
B086L1CDMT,"The resin is clear and doesn't have any bubbles until you start mixing. When I would pour it into my molds and let it sit, I found that a lot of the bubbles would float to the top or shirk in size.",4
B086L1CDMT,"Very easy to use, and works very well! I also love the accessories that come with the product!",5
B086L1CDMT,"The product worked Great , the mixture was spot on Per directions .Poured smooth and No bubbles , very happy with the product.",5
B086L1CDMT,"This is great when using in molds, but it's awful with tumblers. I don't know what the term is called but it separated in circles and made it patchy. I thought It was having a chemical reaction I tried 3 different times with tumblers and it just never changed the outcome even trying different sealers and no chemicals. In the molds however it is very smooth with not a l9t of bubbles.",4
B086L1CDMT,Comes out soft and never fully hardens. Used marked mixing cups to be exact but still after 2 weeks has never fully hardened.,3
B086L1CDMT,I like it very much; however I still don't know how to clean each container nor the droppers. Can you explain? Cannot find it on instructions.Thanks,5
B086L1CDMT,I like working with resin. This is non yellow and durable.,5
B086L1CDMT,I've been using this resin for about a week and so far i'm really liking it! The odor isn't too strong (i do wear a mask just to be safe) and the extras included were really useful!,5
B086L1CDMT,no bubbles just as described.,5
B086L1CDMT,I have used this product a few times and although it does end up being clear it takes a lot longer then the 40 minutes it claims the work time is.,3
B09WCXS3NV,I use these to turn my favorite stickers into magnets so I can show them off without the commitment of sticking them to something forever. The magnet isn't super strong. But I don't really need it to be. It works perfectly for my project and is very easy to manipulate and cut into the shapes I want.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I used these sheets to make business magnets and I couldn't be happier with how they turned out. The Magnets sheets are thick and rigid. They have a great adhesive side that held cards perfectly. I was able to get multiple magnets out of one sheet by cutting to size. These are versatile, durable and a wonderful size for multiple types of projects.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"The adhesive magnetic sheets work great for all of our projects. The items stick well and the magnet is strong enough for use on a steel cabinet, shelving, etc....",5
B09WCXS3NV,"These magnets are weak and very thin. They will make OK fridge or desk magnets, and you can attach small items (paper, balsa wood), but forget about using them for anything more. I used an entire sheet for one piece of thin laser-cut wood and it falls off when I close the fridge door. You also can't draw on these sheets because nothing sticks to the white paper. So if you want to make good fridge magnets with these, I recommend using making your design on the lightest paper or wood you can, and covering the ENTIRE back surface with magnet. Put the magnet on the side of the fridge or some other spot that never moves or vibrates.EDIT: I'm editing this review because I had a thought. Can you layer on 2 of these magnets to get some decent sticking force? Yes. I tried it and it does work. So, here's my recommendation: Double up your magnets and then you'll have something with decent sticking force for its surface area. I'll give back a star since I was able to make these usable. They're fine for small flat light items.",4
B09WCXS3NV,"I try to be very judicious, fair, and honest when rating products because that is what I hope to find when I'm reading reviews and evaluating whether to purchase something. I will buy something that has numerous 2- and 3-star ratings if the thing being complained about is not something that would affect my use of the product.Likewise, I get super annoyed when people give a low rating for a product that doesn't do what they want if the product was not marketed for their intended purpose.  In that vein, I also am extremely particular in that I expect the product page to represent honestly and clearly what the product is expected to do and the performance level of the product.In that vein, if this product had been described as a ""light magnet,"" I would not have purchased it because I was looking for something strong. But the description says ""strong,"" so I ordered it with those expectations.  But after cutting one sheet to a custom size and putting it to use, I see that it is, in fact, not only not ""strong,"" but it's extremely weak. It would probably hold tissue paper-weight paper, but nothing more. Thus, the one-star review. I don't know if I can return it since I've already cut it.I'm very disappointed, and now less trusting of other sites claiming to have ""strong"" flexible, ""cuttable"" magnets. :(",1
B09WCXS3NV,"If you are looking for a way to create a magnetic board this will be the bees knees for you. I could stick them to the frig for a convenient way to keep my grocery list, above the desk for keeping notes, etc. these are durable and versatile.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"The adhesion is strong.  I use these magnets for crafting.  I print images onto sticker paper, then I apply the sticker paper to the adhesive side of these magnet sheets.  Then, I place a clear vinyl sheet on the print, then run it through a Cricut.All the magnets have turned out okay.  Care must be taken when applying the image paper.  If your image paper hits the adhesion of the magnet sheet, it IS NOT coming off...",4
B09WCXS3NV,I love using this to mount photos calendar or to do list around the house and garage. Strong for heavier paper products and good tool. You can cut it to size with common household scissors,5
B09WCXS3NV,these are very thick and sturdy ... Best ones I've used.  Would highly recommend.  I use these for die cuts for crafts.,5
B09WCXS3NV,Easy to use. Sticks well. You can easily cut the magnet to fit your preferred shape and size,5
B09WCXS3NV,These worked out to attach my camera doorbell to the metal mail box.,4

B09WCXS3NV,"I was gifted a toolbox for work and I was so eager to decorate it but I plan to paint it a different color. This allows me to decorate it but not have any sticky or mess when the time comes. I can make anything into a magnet, it's awesome! They stick well too!",5
B09WCXS3NV,Nice and useful,5
B09WCXS3NV,I have some 4 X 6 pictures.  They stick well on its self adhesive sheet that you cannot remove the picture from the sheet. The magnet itself is sufficient to attach the pictures on a metal.,5
B09WCXS3NV,Filled my fridge with pictures. Just got them printed and put these magnets on the back. Looks awesome!,5
B09WCXS3NV,They didn't work for what I bought them.  My car magnets stopped holding and I had hoped to use these to make them stay on.  Didn't work.  I still have them in case I run into anything else for which I can use them.,3
B09WCXS3NV,This worked great when converting stickers to magnets. It made for a good conversion. I'm keeping on hand for my next batch of stickers.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I use these to make fridge magnets. When my kids get school photos, there's always that little picture that isn't one of the ones you ordered with the package that has their class information on there. I go ahead and cut that out and use these magnet sheets to make magnets to put on my fridge. The adhesive is heavy duty. Did a dumb and put the school calendar on face down instead of face up and even though I hadn't pressed down yet, it was stuck on there. No school calendar magnet for me. I like that the sheets are thin enough to cut with regular kitchen scissors. The sheets are really big, too.",4
B09WCXS3NV,Super sturdy and perfect size for my needs!,5
B09WCXS3NV,Product was as advertised. It worked great for holding my dies and I could easily cut to fit my stamp storage cases.,4
B09WCXS3NV,I use these for pictures to put on fridge!!! Would be great as a diy gift 10/10,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I've used other magnetic backings that were thicker and, thus, more magnetic.  These easily slip if you attach it to heavy/thick card stock.  Smaller cut pieces barely sticks to metal.  For the price, I don't expect much.  It's doable.",4
B09WCXS3NV,Used for a party favor: printed archival paper then laminated and attached to these magnet sheets. I was then able to cut the individual magnets to sizes that i wanted.  very easy to cut with a paper cutter or a sharp pair of scissors.  make sure you have your paper exactly where you want it because once it sticks it is stuck on for good!  The only complaint i have is i wish the magnet could be stronger. I took 1 star off for that. It did stick to the fridge (i dont know how long it will) and my metal display board. so overall a good product for party favors but I dont know if I would use this if I was making products to sell.,4
B09WCXS3NV,Work good for  my project.,4
B09WCXS3NV,I bought these to keep in a container for storing wargame miniatures with neodymium magnets glued to the bases. These sheets struggled to keep them stable and I ended up going with solid metal trays. I still found good use for these sheets making refrigerator magnets.,4
B09WCXS3NV,"Great for custom diy jobs, like business magnets, car opportunities, the magnetic hold is good enough for those things and a few others, not for anything that will require a more significant hold.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"These are perfect to hold craft dies.  Mount them on heavy cardboard, wood, or not at all.  I love them.  Great price compared to buying die companies.  They do they job well.",5
B09WCXS3NV,I like buying refrigerator magnets when I visit new places bur sometimes they are super expensive.Stickers are often way cheaper and I use this and an Xacto knife to make my own custom magnets.The sticky back is great and the magnets turn out thick and durable. They stick well to the fridge.Highly recommend.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I have commitment issues when it comes to stickers - I love them but I never end up using them because I'm worried I'll want to move them or I'll need to get rid of whatever I put it on. These work super great for that - put the stickers on them, cut them as close to the sticker as you can, and you can move them around your fridge as much as you want, take them with you if you move, etc. I only use these for stickers my friends make, since they make a ton of them (and I love the art, obviously) and I only have so much fridge space, so hopefully I can find something similar to do with my non-friend stickers at some point. In terms of magnet quality - really great, no chance of them falling off on their own, but still very easy to get them off of the fridge and move them.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"Awesome value for the amount of magnet you get. Perfect for all sizes of craft. They stick great to the fridge. With the self adhesive, making crafts is a breeze. They are not overly powerful and can be removed easy.",5
B09WCXS3NV,These are great! So easy to cut and use for so many of my craft projects. No glue required. Love them!,5
B09WCXS3NV,I think these sheets are good for making magnets with stickers for christmas presents. Quality is good and the thickness of the sheets is easy to cut out intricate designs.,5
B09WCXS3NV,The size is accurate. They are very magnetic and the adhesive is very sticky! They are easy to cut so you can make them smaller if needed!,5
B09WCXS3NV,"its good for flat photos or cards, but not for fridge magnets that are heavier than paper. Disappointing.",3
B09WCXS3NV,"These are perfect for all of my Stampin' Up dies.  They fit perfectly in the plastic boxes that my stamps and dies are kept in.  I can keep all of my dies organized in their corresponding box, and I don't have to worry about losing the dies.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"I wanted this exact product to place stickers on have on my car without it damaging my paint, these worked out so perfectly!!! Easy to cut and has a sticky side so you can place whatever you want and tun it into a magnet. Love it and its a big size for multiple uses",5
B09WCXS3NV,"Wanted to used these to stick a bit of acrylic to the top of my pc to keep cats from pressing my power button all the time... nope. The attracting strength of these magnets, I would say, is just barely sufficient to hold themselves to an appropriate surface, and that they will do, but they're not really strong enough to hold much more.I tested them out, seeing if you could use them to tack a note to the fridge. They were able to hold up 2 sheets of .1 mm thin paper (the kind used for supermarket circulars) but folding those over once (to 4 layers of thin paper) increased the distance between the fridge and the magnet too much and overcame the force of attraction. I suppose they will serve their intended purpose (sticking photos or postcards to the fridge) but they are by no means impressive and hardly versatile for other projects.I ended up buying some small (10x3mm) neodymium magnets for less than half the price of these with a much better magnetic strength. Four of those (they send you 50) are holding that cover in place with enough force to provide some resistance to a cat sleeping up there... and hopefully not messing up the nearest cooling fans lol. Those are far more conspicuous though, not nearly as pretty, but if you don't mind seeing a shiny magnet and don't need the magnet to be form fitting those are probably a better bet. I won't knock these too hard as they will probably stick a photo or a postcard to fridge capably (and give you a fun little project to do and a reason to get out your cutting mat if so inclined).",3
B09WCXS3NV,I used these to convert bumper stickers into magnets. Placing the stickers onto the magnet sheet adhesive was a little tricky without wrinkles or bubbles. With a bit of forethought that worked out fine.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"This adhesive sheet may work for pictures or paper, but not for anything with any amount of weight. I put up 6X7 inch piece of acrylic and, with strips on each side, it did not hold it.  I had to use double stick tape instead.  Three stars as it is magnetic and a good price, but not for heavy use.",3
B09WCXS3NV,Car magnets.  Magnets rather weak but did work.,4
B09WCXS3NV,"I use these for the labels on my bead trays. I cut the magnets with scissors in the shape of my labels. One side is attached with the adhesive to the label, and the other is attached to the bead tray. (its best to attach it to the label also-sticky side out)If the contents of the bead box change, I can simply remove the top printed label, and leave the magnet part on the box, ready for a new label. Great idea (my own!) for anyone with any craft projects they need to label and categorize!",5
B09WCXS3NV,If you're looking to save a grade sticker or patch and want to put it on your fridge or in your old truck this is the way to go. Great functionality it's not too thick and the size is exactly what you need for small items. Great hold and so far very durable.,5
B09WCXS3NV,It did exactly what I needed it to do.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I store my die cuts on these, for the most part they work, but they are a little thin and flimsy but they do the job I intend for them",4
B09WCXS3NV,"I had bought these to use for 3D printed shelving, and after applying it, went to test it with a polarity tester I had made. Said polarity tester had only the slightest pull towards the sheet, certainly not enough to keep miniatures securely held against the sheet. This is a grade N52 neodymium magnet being used for testing against the sheet I bought, keep in mind, one of the strongest consumer grade magnets you can buy, and there was barely any pull (meanwhile some nearby staples were pulled to the magnet without me even trying). Testing with thicker pieces of metal like silverware showed even less attraction the neodymium magnet, and I would say the magnetism of this sheet is so poor I would say it's worse than a refrigerator magnet, and upon testing that claim, I would say it's true. Most refrigerator magnets I've used have more hold over less surface area. This sheet, on the other hand, seems to need a large amount of surface area in contact with a ferromagnetic surface to even establish a baseline level of hold in the first place. The fact that it was able to hold itself and the 3D printed shelf (weighing at only 3.5 ounces together) actually surprised me, because I thought it wouldn't even be strong enough for that. The bottom line is this: if you have a project where you need to cut the sheet roughly in half or smaller, look elsewhere. If you need a massive refrigerator magnet, or just need to stick something light to a metal surface using the entire sheet, then this is about all it's good for. About the only good thing I can say about this is that the adhesive is strong. Ironically the adhesive backing is so strong that it's tough to remove once placed. You cannot remotely say the same for the sheet's magnetic properties.",1
B09WCXS3NV,I love the magnetic sheets they are easy to cut. Not to heavy and great size for all of my stickers. It has a strong adhesive back so I have to be very careful but it's definitely not going no where. It performs like it should and it Doesn't have no problems. Is this product versatile to different materials it does have a strong adhesive so depending on how flimsy the material you are sticking to it may create a lot of errors so it just depends on how careful you are because it's not coming off.,5
B09WCXS3NV,Magnet is lightweight and easy to cut.  Works well for the seasonal fridge magnets I make.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I'm going to preface with - I'm sure my DIY project is not what most people use this for. If I wanted to make magnets for the fridge - it would have been perfect. However, my intended use was to create a magnetic screen protector - I tested the magnet on the non-screen portion of my tablet and it didn't stick. Will have to try something else instead.",3
B09WCXS3NV,"Extremely sticky, unable to reposition. Works well when photos are applied as a fridge magnet. Much more economical than ordering photo magnets  from school.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"I ordered some bumper stickers from the Sphere collection at the U2 site, and since stickers are a bit too permanent for me, wanted to turn them into magnets instead. So ordered these. They're a little short for the length of the stickers - I guestimated what length I needed without knowing the exact dimensions of the stickers, and ended up with just a smidge of overhang on each end - but were easy to mark and trim to be the right height, or would have been if I could put them on straight. But that's on me, not the magnet sheets. :) But since I'm using them as fridge magnets and not car magnets, things didn't have to be precise, I was pretty pleased with how they turned out.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"I was going to use this for magnetic bookmarks but it was too weak. It ended up sliding too easily on the page. The magnet sheet was easy to cut though, I even used a hole puncher on it. This product would probably be good for basic fridge magnets that don't need to hold anything.",4
B09WCXS3NV,Been using these to turn stickers into fridge magnets & bumper magnets. Going great so far and value is solid.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I wanted to put stickers on this to make magnets and cut them out. This worked great for my needs. It is easy to cut. I put stickers both on the adhesive and on top of the white cover (provided more contrast to some of my stickers). Both seem to have worked well so far.The reason I took off 1 star was because the magnet is not very strong. I looked back at the description, and it doesn't really talk about that either way. But it would have been nice if it had more strength to it. I'm not sure my magnets could hold anything, like on a fridge. But as a magnet that is just for decoration, it's great.",4
B09WCXS3NV,"the adhesive is fine but the magnetic pull is very weak. i do not recommend buying these for storing table top miniatures such as warhammer, they slide too much",3
B09WCXS3NV,"This was an item my daughter was interested in. She spends a lot of her spare time doing crafty things and made some cutouts of several things she wants to use as refrigerator magnets. She was looking for something sticky on one side and magnetic on the other. That pretty well describes this item.So far, it has worked perfectly for her purposes and she's happy with the item.This is a good, inexpensive item for light crafting projects.",4
B09WCXS3NV,"I've been an aircraft mechanic for 25 years. If there is one thing that can be said of our profession, it is that we love our stickers. Most mechanics will plaster and cover their tool boxes with stickers of all shapes, and sizes across a wide range of topics not to mention our dry and off color humor.The big problem that most of us face, especially when new to the industry, is that we cover our tool boxes with stickers then quickly outgrow the available space, prompting a new tool box. Obviously we seldom take our stickers with us.These handy sheets are a game changer. Since discovering them two years ago, I don't think I've added a single photo or sticker to my box that isn't attached to the magnetic material. This allows me to pull my stickers before off loading my tool box, or rearranging them as needed when I acquire new stickers.This is a great product. It cuts easy scissors or an exacto blade. They are worth the money if you are a collector or photos or stickers or anything else that you want to display on a magnetic surface.",5
B09WCXS3NV,These worked great for a project that I had,5
B09WCXS3NV,"Does not stick well to a textured wall well. I should have seen that coming, but our wall is not too terribly textured. Picture attached for reference.",4
B09WCXS3NV,"Probably only works as fridge sticker. If you are looking for magnet for other purpose or craft, this is not it.",3
B09WCXS3NV,"I don't leave many reviews, unless something is exceptional or pitiful....The magnetic adhesion of these sheets is very weak. They barely stick to each other (2X magnetization).  Full sheets are acceptable, but smaller cuttings are very weak. Bought these for very lightweight 3D printed tool chest drawer labels (3/8"" x 4"") - they barely hold on and I see them slipping over time ad the drawers are used. 2 stars for good adhesion side. Steer clear....",2
B09WCXS3NV,Stick great. Magnet side and sticky side for picture both work well. Printing pictures of vacation and fur babies putting on refrigerator.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"What a great product , easy to use and best part no damaging nail holes",5
B09WCXS3NV,No me encanta. No pega muy fuerte.,3
B09WCXS3NV,"very good magnet, good size easy to cut for what you need it for would purchase again",5
B09WCXS3NV,I bought this for my daughters that love crafts.  They especially wanted to make things and add the magnetic backing to place on the fridge.  This works perfectly for that.  The quality was good.,5
B09WCXS3NV,Happy with them! Great for making custom magnets,5
B09WCXS3NV,Seems like many of these are more reliant on an adhesive coating to stick on non metallic surfaces. Then you apply a ferrite like object to the surface. I cut these up and use them with stronger magnets to hold down foam filters on room HVAC outlets to cut down dust.,4
B09WCXS3NV,Easy to use and magnet is strong.,5
B09WCXS3NV,it could be better,3
B09WCXS3NV,Just what I needed,4
B09WCXS3NV,This magnet barely holds it's own weight up.,3
B09WCXS3NV,"If you're a fridge magnet person and wish more souvenir items & nick nacks had a magnetic strip, this product is for you!",5
B09WCXS3NV,I purchased these so I could make signs for cruise cabin metal doors.  The magnets seem strong so they will be sturdy and adhere well.  I made up pretty  anniversary signs for the friends that will be accompanying us on the cruise so it is easy to find our rooms in the long hallways.  I can think of all kinds of ways to use them.Easy to cut into any shape needed and east to adhere the pictures to the sticky side.,5
B09WCXS3NV,"These sheets are a great for turning stickers and printed designs into your very own magnets.They are nice and thin but still have a strong magnetic strength. We made stickers for our fridge and Disney cruise.These sheets have a strong adhesive on one side, ensuring your designs stay firmly attached to the magnet. Plus, they have a reliable magnetic force on the other side.The quality of the adhesive ensures that your magnets won't easily peel off, and they can be applied to various surfaces, from metal to plastic and even wood. The possibilities are endless, and the ease of use makes it accessible for both beginners and seasoned crafters.In summary, Magnetic Adhesive Sheets open up a world of creativity for Cricut enthusiasts, making it a breeze to transform stickers and printed designs into unique, custom magnets.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"My major issue is that while the magnets themselves are plenty strong, the adhesive used to secure the magnets to surfaces/non-ferous items is nowhere near as strong.  I had hoped to use these to secure metal artwork to my wall, and while the magnets themselves hold onto the art, the adhesive used to secure it to the wall isn't.  I've tried trippling up on them to no avail.  I know the magnests are strong enough, because I find them still securely attached to the metal art work, now on the flooor, the next morning.  They do seem to stick for a number of hours, they don't fail immediatly.  FWIW,  my wall art is 1.5 lbs (0.7 kg), and I used two full 4"" x 6"" sheets, which suggests the adhesive strength fails at around 0.75 lbs (0.35 kg) of pull.",3
B09WCXS3NV,"They won't work for what I wanted which was the back of a VERY Light sign and I used two sheets to cover the back thinking it would be more than enough.... but it didn't hold for more than a minute.... so I will use this for the back of photos to go on my fridge or something like that and they will work just fine.  I knew it wasn't going to be a heavy duty magnet, but I did think it would be a little bit stronger than it is.Again, lots of uses just more in the very light type of usage.",4
B09WCXS3NV,Wonderful for making my Dutch brother stickers into fridge magnets!,5
B09WCXS3NV,"I don't like to put stickers on my car so I use these two stickers and then cut them out to stick on The car, workbench, etc. They are thin but it does help when cutting them out to be able to be more precise. Great adhesive.",5
B09WCXS3NV,"I use these magnetic sheets to make fridge magnets out of photos. Fast, easy, successful. Clean and good looking. I have KitchenAid kitchen shears and using nose it was easy to cut the pieces to size.",5
B09WCXS3NV,I just love these magnets they are the best,5
B00007E7D2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I use these laminating sheets for laminating my stickers. Its absolutly perfect. With the laminate the stickers are better protected from water. I have made sticker for my water bottle and is worked perfect with some water. It is 100% procent see trough, so no glaze. It's very easy to use. There is a strip that you can remove so you can stick it on your paper what you want to laminate. Then you can easlily place it in to the paper. With this laminate I have never had any bubbles. The aplication goes very smooth. Its sticks very good. Once aplied you cannot remove it anymore.",5
B00007E7D2,I use these as part of my process for making stickers and magnets.  They work good.,5
B00007E7D2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have tried over 5 different Laminating brands. These are by far superior! The quality of these is uncanny. Not to mention the value you get for the cost.Super easy to use with the pre-peel area.,5
B00007E7D2,"This is an AMAZING product. I use this to put over my vinyl dye-cut stickers and it's great! The stickiness is phenomenal, so be aware that as soon as this touches paper there is no readjusting without tearing the paper. Make sure you line everything up PERFECTLY before even slightly touching the paper with it or you'll have to start your project over. This has given my stickers great protection and makes my water resistant vinyl become waterproof. It's durable, the perfect thickness, and the clarity is great.As great as this product is I do have two complains that kept it from being a 5 star product for me. First, this laminate collects fine scratches very easily, so if your making stickers beware because they are noticable. Second, I use a Cricut Explore Air 2 to cut my stickers and no matter how new the blade is or what settings I use I still get jagged edges or drag marks on about 20% of my stickers. I don't have any issues cutting anything else so I know it's the laminate causing the issue. I can trim off the jagged edges but there isn't anything I can do about the drag marks. It does fine with scissors, so if you just need to cut it for simple projects you'll be fine.There are ways around these issues and everyone's projects are different, so I still highly recommend this product. I'll keep buying it myself!My application process:1. I trim the laminate to fit my project perfectly. At the top of the laminate there is a small strip you can peel off to get your start, DON'T cut that piece off when trimming to fit your project.2. I tape the bottom of my project to a smooth surface to prevent it from moving while applying the laminate. *It's important the surface is completely smooth to prevent air bubbles*3. I peel off the backing strip, mentioned above, and line everything up PERFECTLY then press the laminate to my project.3. I fold back the laminate and peel the backing up just enough to get a good hold and then lay it back down while still holding the backing.4. I slowly peel the backing off with one hand while the other hand is being used as a squeegee to keep air bubbles from forming. *Keep your squeegee hand running with the backing while it's pulling off for best results*5. After the backing is completely off I tape down wax paper over my project and use a hard plastic scraper all over my project to make sure the laminate is completely stuck down and to remove any air bubbles. * I use wax paper over top to prevent the scraper from scratching the laminate. I tape the wax paper downto prevent it from sliding around and scratching the laminate*6. I remove the wax paper and the tape from the bottom of the project then cut my stickers out.This has been perfect for me and I hope it helps you too.",4
B00007E7D2,"I think this is the best price for good. quality Laminating Sheets.  50 sheets last a long time.  I am not sure it they are the best but they have been serving the purpose of my document protection for a long time.  I also use them in signs, and important notes I need to save etc.",5
B00007E7D2,it did the job. I thought it would be more sturdy but it was still good.,5
B00007E7D2,"These were perfect for my needs.  They were easy to use (as easy to use as laminating sheets usually are).  They adhered well to the cardstock I applied them to.  If you want a smooth adhesion without bubbles or anything make sure you are applying with a smoothing tool of some sort or a ruler or something (save yourself some trouble and look up a youtube video of how to properly apply a laminating sheet (again not a pouch) and you will likely not have any serious issues with bubbles or wrinkles.  You should be aware that there is a slight crease because the backing is cut near the edge to help you peel a small area to line up your item without sticking the whole thing down.  This crease does not show up much when proper application is used on most paper products but on something like a photo it may be more visible.  If using with a photo you may want to line photos up to the edge of that line so it does not go through the middle of an image.Many people who are unhappy with this product seem to be confused about what they are buying.  It should be clear that what you are getting is not a laminating pouch it is laminating sheets.  This means it covers one side of a sheet of paper.  In order to create a double sided laminated item where it is completely enclosed you will need to use two sheets together.  For double sided lamination I would definitely recommend a pouch as those are much easier to work with with for that type of application.  These sheets however are perfect for uses where only one side needs lamination (like homemade stickers, boxes that only need a protective layer on the outside, adding a protective layer to things like the cover of a paperback book to make it more durable, etc...)Some people have likened this product to contact paper.  Personally I do not find the two items comparable.  Contact paper I've used does not adhere as well as these sheets (clearly a different adhesive must be used) and is thinner.  For example I have been able to rip contact paper but I cannot rip these laminating sheets.  They are thinner than an adhesive laminating pouch or a thermal pouch and will not provide the same stiff type of protection as those.  Also, these sheets do not have a high gloss finished look it's more like a semi-gloss type finish to it, it's not dull but its not extremely shiny.  I liked the weight and finish for my uses which was to add an additional layer for outside protection on a calendar box but for those looking for heavy duty laminates that create a stiff hard cover over both sides of a document... this is not the product for you.",5
B00007E7D2,"Not sure how to describe it, but it's like a mottled texture that adds an unappealing ""spotted"" look to whatever you're trying to laminate and obfuscates documents badly. Unfortunately it took me a few messed up documents and sheets to realize it wasn't my technique, but the laminate itself that has this texture. You can see what I mean in the letter I was trying to laminate; it's almost like a greasy, glittery, grainy look. Absolutely not what I was hoping for in a ""clear"" laminate.On the plus side, I didn't have too much difficulty applying it. It has a nifty slit at the top that you can peel the backing off from first, apply to the document, and then ease the laminate off the backing and onto the paper. I did use a felt-edge squeegee and that helped a lot; if you're doing it entirely by hand, you'll likely have some trouble.If they actually were clear (which, again, they are not) the convenience might justify the cost. It doesn't. Overall it just isn't worth it compared to hot lamination which doesn't have this ugly texture and is easier to apply without special tools. You also get 50 sheets, but if you're laminating documents you'll only get 25 uses out of it. Way less economical for worse convenience and a worse-looking outcome.One consideration I've seen in reviews is that these may not be a permanent, sealed lamination solution. That is to say, in a year they may have come off the paper or come apart from each other, so your ""laminated"" document might actually be exposed to the elements. They held up so far on the test documents I did, but it's only been a few days. Unfortunately, another downside is that if you want to get your documents out of the laminate...you can't, unlike thermal lamination pouches.It seems Avery downgraded the quality of these semi-recently, which is unfortunate. Returning these and going with a proper laminator, there's way too many sacrifices to be made for me to be using these for actually important documents. If you wanted to just laminate an activity sheet for kids quickly, this is fine. I don't think this would work for stickers either because of the texture it has.PROS+ goes on easily if you use a squeegee+ don't need a thermal laminator+ peel strip to make it easier to applyCONS- ugly spotted/mottled/grainy texture. not clear!- makes documents look bad honestly. they look greasy and gross- can only laminate up to 25 documents with the provided sheets- hard to apply by hand- may not be permanently sealed like thermal lamination, but you also can't get your documents out of the laminate since it sticks to the paper",3
B00007E7D2,The film is clear so that the document being covered is very visible. I suggest that first time users practice once on a scrap document to learn how to avoid wrinkkes. The adhesion is excellent.,4
B00007E7D2,As advertised,5
B00007E7D2,"Arrived within two days (without Prime), sooner than expected date. Love using these for home projects.",5

B00007E7D2,"Made some certificates for our kid's baseball team and wanted to laminate them. You need to have a perfectly flat surface, plenty of light, and not drink a can of Monster before using these. I had to reprint 8 certificates because if you don't line these sheets up perfectly there is no forgiveness. Order self-adhesive packs with extra sheets and make sure the document you're trying to laminate isn't 1 of 1 unless you know you're ready to perform surgery with the best of them.",4
B00007E7D2,i wanted to make a small conversion chart for cooking to keep on side of fridge... came out so well i made one for my daughter...i used a small clip with magnet to hold in place...easy on/off and do not have to go searching anymore...good job,5
B00007E7D2,"Great quality despite there being curling upon delivery! Easy to use, saved me a trip from going to office max to use their lamination machine.",5
B00007E7D2,"Very clear and adhere well, no bubbles.",5
B00007E7D2,"These are single sheets.  I had previously purchased another product which had joined sheets (actually folded on the length) and was much easier to work with.  Being these are single sheets, you have to get the placement just right on the first sheet and then align the second sheet corner-to-corner and keep the item you're laminating centered as well.  I did not manage that.  I was laminating a piece of notebook paper which had been written on in 1995 - instructions for a card game.  Signatures of the players are on the back of the paper.  I really wanted to preserve this item properly.  I had a difficult time getting this quite soft and creased (from having been folded for so many years) onto the first sheet.  I had a  somewhat difficult time landing my paper onto the first sheet, and a very difficult time getting the second sheet to ""land"" correctly onto the paper (which nearly filled the laminating sheet size).  In the long run, I had to trim the edges b/c it went on crooked and I could not get all the air bubbles out so I have creases in my document and the lamination sheets.I wish I had known/realized this would be the case.  The product I used before?  I have looked through past purchases online - it's not there.  I think I must have purchased a ""Scotch"" brand before.  I remember it had red in the 'about' sheet.  Unfortunately I threw the package away recently.  Do I dare go see if it's in the current garbage?  I went and looked as far as I dared.  Nothing.The closest I can find to what I used previously, I will link here.  The item I used had a yellow strip down the folded edge and you could insert the item easily, removing the strip, using a ruler or other straight edge to get the second sheet properly applied.  I believe the way it was configured, you could move your document/item around on the first sheet, placing it just right then use a straight edge (ruler) as you removed the protective barrier off the sticky(-ier?) side.I have looked through laminating sheets here on Amazon and don't see one with the yellow strip in the fold (probably 8.5"" x 11"" size sheets).  If you find it, please leave a link if you can.  Thank you.Perhaps this one is more like what I purchased before.  (I have purchases here on Amazon going back to 2007 - so no telling where/when I bought the other laminating sheets.)  I typically really like Avery products.  I suppose there are uses for single sheets but it wasn't for what I attempted and it was ""too late"" once I got that paper to land on the very sticky first sheet... etc., etc.Meanwhile - I just can't figure out what I will do with the balance of what I now understand are ""single sheet"" lamination ""sheets"".  :(Hope this helps someone who is not realizing the differences in these sheets.https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-Self-Sealing-Laminating-LS854-25G-WM-LS854WC/dp/B00006HZ5F/ref=sr_1_19?crid=2OP17QGLEX4SJ&keywords=laminating+sheets&qid=1640475573&sprefix=laminating+sheets%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-19",4

B00007E7D2,"in the past, I had laminating sheets from another company, and the backings were almost impossible to remove. These separate easily, and once applied are very adhesive. I'm pleased they shipped so quickly to me. I've used them and will continue to purchase them in the future.",5
B00007E7D2,These are great for stickers! Side note: if washed they are not waterproof for stickers or labels.,4
B00007E7D2,"I use these self-adhesive laminating sheets at work and at home & have been doing so for years.  They are so practical - if you remember the days of buying a home laminating machine where you put your document inside the laminating film and all that into a cardboard carrier and fed it into the machine, after it heated up to ""slightly less hot than the sun"" mode.  Only to have it jam or not be hot enough to seal completely...or, oh, horrors, the times when you forgot to use the carrier pouch & melted plastic into the machine.Those days are gone!!  These self adhesives take a little bit of messing with.  One piece of advice, peel off the backing and put the adhesive film sticky side up on a table and then lay your document (face down, of course) onto the adhesive sheet.  If you do it the other way and try to bring the film onto the paper, static attraction tends to 'grab' portions of the paper so everything sticks unevenly, wrinkles, leaves bubbles.  If you do it the way I described that won't happen.If you do get a small wrinkle - be gentle, take your finger nail and run it down the wrinkle - many times you can smooth it our entirely or make it much less noticeable.  I use pieces of decorative paper, paste a label in the middle (or glue stick paper down as a label) and sandwich both sides in the adhesive file.  You can then hole punch it and attach it to bags and kits with rope or flex ties...presto: a sturdy ID tag.Even a temporary sign looks so much better if you put a laminator sheet on it - they're great things to keep in your work or home office!",5
B00007E7D2,"The material is of great quality, but I really struggled with not creasing it in the middle when placing it on my printed pages. I will try another brand next time.",3

Each 9 x 12-inch sheet comes with a permanent adhesive, providing a clear, durable finish that enhances the appearance of your materials. The pack includes 50 laminating sheets, making it a great option for larger projects or frequent use. These sheets are ideal for DIY lamination without the need for a laminating machine. I will buy again!",5
B00007E7D2,"I've used these for over a decade.  Only ever bought one or two packs.  I use them for small labels for wire harness connectors and circuit board chips.  The laminate is nice because it won't allow ink to smudge once the laminate is over top.  Nothing bad to say at all and after 10 years of having them, they still work well.. no drying out of the adhesive, discoloration or anything like that.I usually print out a sheet of labels on self-adhesive backed labels.  Then I set the label sheet on a table and peel back an inch or so of this laminate sheet, slap it down at the top of the label sheet and grab the peeled paper section from underneath with one hand while using a ruler to push down the laminate nice and flat as i glide the ruler down the label sheet.  For the most part this reduces or eliminates bubbles and any remaining bubbles can usually be worked out by pushing on them.  I think I've actually just completely removed the paper from the laminate sheet once or twice too and slapped it down on the paper I wanted to laminate.  I'm just more inclined to use a ruler because it's how I've done it and is less error-prone.",5

B00007E7D2,"It is very good for laminating, it is very resistant and easy to apply, although I DO NOT RECOMMEND laminating on glossy paper because the finish is a bit confusing for photos. It is better to use a good matte sticker sheet (jackandjack) and use these laminating ones on top. Although it says it does not require a laminating machine for BEST QUALITY and FINISH you can run the stickers through a laminating machine at low to medium temperature.",5
B00007E7D2,"Laminates without heat! Not as thick as the heated method machines. But, it worked for what I needed to have laminated for my kayak fishing adventures!",4
B00007E7D2,"The product ad said that there were 50 laminating sheets, but I misinterpreted this.  I thought they were double sided and connected to form a laminating ""pocket"".  There actually 50 single sided laminating sheets.  So after you affixed the document to the sheet, you would have to trim right up to the edge of the document you were laminating to insure that no sticky edges were exposed or you would have to use something as a backing to attach the laminating sheet to like a piece of paper or cardboard.  If you were wanting to laminate both sides of the document you would need to use two sheets.  And then, because each sheet is separate, you have to figure out a way to line them up as you're peeling the backing off and then you have to press down with something hard and flat to make sure that it stays smooth and doesn't wrinkle up on you.  This was not an easy process, but I eventually figured a method to make it work.  Some online videos helped as well.",3
B00007E7D2,This is the best product for my business,5
B00007E7D2,"I didn't read the description well.  These aren't laminating sleeves.  They are sheets. So you apply one sheet to your paper and if you want the other side laminated, you need to apply another sheet.  This was my fault and used more sheets than I expected but I had enough for the small job I was doing.  The package of laminating sheets was folded over and shipped to me in a bag.  It took some time to flatten them out to be easily used.  For this product, it would've been preferable to be shipped in a box.  If I'd had multiple items in an order, it's possible it would've shipped that way.  The sheets are very sticky and you need to have a steady hand or you'll end up with creases.  I had a few creases, but the flip side of being very sticky is that the lamination won't come apart so all in all I was happy with how it turned out.",4
B00007E7D2,Awesome to keep some of your precious documents safe. Love these sheets. Highly recommend,5
B00007E7D2,"I bought these to test out waterproofing stickers for my small business and they definitely work when paired with an already water resistant sticker vinyl. I've had stickers last through the dishwasher with heated drying a few times without any issues which is amazing. BUT there are noticeable lines/ridges running across the laminating sheet that bother me a little bit. With a ton of elbow grease I was able to squeegee them completely flat but I'm still left with these ridges that I can't get rid of. This also brought up the new issue of scuffing the heck out of the sheet which I will admit is my own fault. I was using a Cricuit XL Scraper on the first try and on the second I put a microfiber cloth under the scraper to protect the laminate which helped a ton. You can see the scuff marks I made in the smaller, round sticker and the second larger sticker was with my makeshift padded scraper. In the end they did what they were supposed to, but I'm not a fan of the ridges that are visible when the light hits them. It wasn't the quality I hoped for and I don't think I'll be able to charge as much as I was wanted for my waterproofed stickers.Overall these sheets are still pretty darn good at waterproofing and I'm sure I'll find other uses for them as well. And you've all been warned about the scuffing.",4
B00007E7D2,Very easy to use and would buy again.,5
B00007E7D2,A good deal,5
B00007E7D2,Nice,5
B00007E7D2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Update: Just learned I can use a cold laminator for a nice smooth finish. So hopefully I can skip my before process.I use this Laminate for all my stickers. I noticed when I use the roller the air bubbles would still be there and I would actually end up with more creases. So this method works for me. That tool I'm using came with my scoreboard its to help create crease on cardstock paper. I press on the areas I know where my stickers are going to cut around. Very few you get a small air bubble just poke it with something small and sharp and use the tool to go over it. If by chance your stickers get a line crease. Use the tool and gently go the direction is going for the most part you can save that sticker.Cons: it is time consuming, but the end result is great. I never got it to look clear and I place the laminate down itself without this extra step.",5
B00007E7D2,"They're easy to use, durable, and create a professional finish, making them ideal for preserving important papers or photos.",5
B00007E7D2,Purchased these to waterproof labels I am making with my Cricut.  I originally purchased the waterproof printable vinyl from Cricut.  What a total waste of money.  I can't count the number of sheets I ruined because the laminating sheet provided was so stiff and difficult to apply.  Was about to give up on the whole idea of making waterproof labels until I saw a youtube video using these sheets.  My first attempt at applying these sheets from Avery was a complete success.  I am so over buying Cricut brand products.  They just aren't worth the money.  With a little effort you can find non-Cricut products at better prices and work so much better.,5
B00007E7D2,"Easy to apply. I like to keep little things in them, and they work perfectly.",5
B00007E7D2,GOOD,5
B00007E7D2,I used these to laminate stickers and they did the job perfectly.,5
B00007E7D2,easy to use and good quality,5
B00007E7D2,Works greatLubs very nicely.,5
B00007E7D2,I use these to laminate little stickers that I give to my customers.  They always work great!!,5
B00007E7D2,"I use these to laminate stickers I make at home using full sheet label paper and a Silhouette 3 cutter. These have about a quarter in strip cut at the top that you peel first and adhere to the surface or a mat before beginning the peel the rest and work it down over the paper or label sheet you are using. I find peeling back a couple inches to start with helps avoid bubbles or wrinkles. Also using a side to side sweeping motion with a squeegee tool or credit card will help make sure all the air escapes out the sides. Overall really easy to use, just give yourself a practice sheet or two in order to get the technique down.",5
B00007E7D2,"I've tried lots of different laminating sheets, and let me tell you these come out on time 100% of the time! Not only is the adhesive really strong which is great for things like stickers and laminating important documents. The clarity is so clear you can't even tell there's anything on top.",5
B00007E7D2,I use this product at the office. It is my go to for laminating.,5
B00007E7D2,"Used these in conjunction with sticker paper and my cricut for my nieces graduation, it turned out so cute! Definitely would buy again, it was tricky to use because it was so sticky but I will eventually get the trick to it",5
B00007E7D2,"I know, how hard can it be right? I don't know what I keep doing wrong but I keep getting bubbles. I have tried by hand, will a roller & a scraper and I keep getting bubbles. It sticks really well, much better than expected. It's a nice thick layer that will save any document or photo easily. It's a pretty good value for your money if you figure out how to use these without getting the bubbles. I personally was using these on a photo paper.",4
B00007E7D2,"As with any adhesive plastic, when you use this to cover plain paper it can stick to the paper in the wrong place or stick to itself, and be difficult to correct. That's why you should read and follow the instructions (which are only about how to make it easy on yourself anyway). I used 12 sheets to cover 6 pages front and back, and they all came out fine because I took my time and did the thing properly.",5
B00007E7D2,"So these are the glossy sheets i use for my small business and I really like them.However, when I purchased these recently I got one that was clearly a fake. My original order was ""Made in Mexico"" and they are thicker and the backing peels off easy. The most recent order I got as soon as I opened the pack I could tell something was off, the backing peeled off poorly, the texture of the film was blotchy and thin, on top of that the packaging color was different. So I compared and yes! The recent one I was sent had a sticker over the Made in Mexico that said ""Made in US"".. my first order did not. So I requested a return right away. I just received my replacement and it's just like my first original order which I'm happy with because that's what I wanted. So BEWARE!! I DONT KNOW HOW THESE ARE SELECTED.... I just know that my second order of this turned out to be a fake. Look for the indication that it's fake before use.-Should say Made in Mexico-Backing should peel off easy-The laminate sheet should be more clear than blotchy",5
B00007E7D2,I liked that the self-adhesive laminate was easy to apply. The laminate adhered well to the cardstock that I was covering. One sheet covered the 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper. There may have been some lifting where the laminate sheet exceeds the width of the paper. It is simple to cut away those longer edges.,4
B00007E7D2,These are great laminate sheets.  Recommend.,5
B00007E7D2,Great fit looks good,3
B00007E7D2,"Someone else shared the same comment and I wanted to second this. PLEASE READ!I love this product but there are two different manufacturers that you have to watch out for. The ones I receive that have a sticker that says ""made is US"" is a lower quality that is thinner and spottier. The paper feels visibly thinner and whiter. I didn't know this when I ordered the first pack and thought that was normal. Then I ordered a second one and was chocked by the quality difference of the second one. The packs that say ""made in Mexico"" have a slightly yellow tint and are always of higher quality. I don't know why and I ordered multiple through amazon and walmart and received a mixed batch from both US and Mexico. I am returning all the US ones. These work great and should be very glossy/clear. Once you get used to applying them, it's straightforward and add a great saturation to the finished product. I recommend using a ruler (i glued felt on one side) to slide on the laminate.",5
B00007E7D2,"First time I've ever used laminating sheets and was trying to protect my own art work,  I was giving this to a child and didn't think she'd beable to care for this without it being able to be handled...So I thought of laminating it and it turned out well..........I found it a bit awkward to figure out if I wanted to put the sticky side face up on a counter, and put the paper on top of it without wrinkling, or did I want to try and place the sticky side on top of my paper and hope I wasn't sticking the paper to the work surface.......With much deliberation, I finally placed my art work on top of the sticky side up laminating sheet...and realized there were a few kinks in the paper.... So I put another sticky sheet on the back and then went for a rolling pin to get the few bubbles out and help create a better seal..  It worked....so now I know how to do this... My art work was almost the same size as the laminating sheet so nothing stuck to the counter I was working on.  For a smaller item this would have been easier....I'm happy with this purchase...It's 50 sheets but if you want to laminate  back and front of something as big as the laminating sheet, it is going to use uptwo sheets.",5
B00007E7D2,"Easy to use.  Can cut to size.  Backing paper has a grid to help make sure you keep your cut lines straight.  Great when you need to laminate something (contractor license, business license) but you don't want to go to Kinkos.  I use it for my small business.",5
B00007E7D2,These are good to get for making custom die-cut stickers (for Cameo 4). I tried another brand and it didn't cut all the way like it should have. The quality is good and makes the stickers look professional.,5
B00007E7D2,"Very sticky and clear. Used on magnets and worked great. Magnet with magnetic sheet, paper and laminate was cut with a cricut explore 2.",5
B00007E7D2,"I purchased these to make activity sheets for road trips, restaurants, and general on-the-go fun. I'd reccomend making sure there is enough space in between the papers edge and where you cut if you're cutting the sheets, just to make sure each side adheres to each other.",5
B00007E7D2,"I recommend using a scraper (Like a debit card) to smooth out an bubbles, but it works great!",5
B00007E7D2,Great reliable product. I use for all types of projects from stickers to documents. Love the easy peel tab. It makes applications much easier.,5
B00007E7D2,Well made and easy to use,4
B00007E7D2,"Do not try to Laminate whole sticker sheets.  Although it takes longer cut your stickers out first with enough border to cut them out again.  Lay the laminate sheet on a flat surface and lay stickers that are cut out individually on the sheet.  Once all are done lay the back (or paper) (nonsticky) on top to reduce excessive adhesive sticking to everything.  Took me a few tries and some choice words, but this works.  Laminating a whole sticker sheets at once?  Good luck.",4
B00007E7D2,Pain to laminate,3
B00007E7D2,The backing is easy to peel off and the sheet is easy to apply by hand. After a couple minutes it clears up and you have a crystal clear laminate.,5
B00007E7D2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like the product. It's important to note that I received the ""made in the USA"" version. My only issue is that they have rolled into a tube over the past five months. Next time I'll keep them in their packaging. I can still apply them to my sticker sheets with no issues as long as I use a little scotch tape to keep my sticker sheet in place before applying the laminate.",4
B00007E7D2,I bought these because I was making bookmarks for my church and wanted to make them to make them more sturdy and durable.  They worked perfectly. They were very easy to apply I would definitely suggest them and would buy them again and again.,5
B00007E7D2,I like the fact it's easy to use,4
B00007E7D2,"I got these for my sons hand print artwork that we do. I want it to last forever! Also, I got it to laminate my sons ultrasound photos. They were very flimsy like paper and I didn't want them getting destroyed. It took awhile to get the hang of it but I'm glad I got these!",5
B00007E7D2,I was using this on top of printable vinyl to make waterproof stickers and it worked wonderfully!,5
B00007E7D2,"This paper is good for simple projects and crafts. But since I run a business, they were decent. The paper would crinkle and cause air bubbles. I tried peeling the back, then adding my labels, then using a credit card to crap the bubbles out. It's good sometimes,  but some labels did not have a smooth gap-free finish. So I have to go with a laminator machine.",4
B00007E7D2,"Hi, the product is very good, but I was missing 3 sheets.",4
B00007E7D2,Works well,4
B00007E7D2,hmmm normal,4
B00007E7D2,"Easy lamination without the costly machinery.  It would help if it came with something to help line up the top and bottom pages, though.  It's challenging to get them perfectly straight resulting in the need to trim them to remove the sticky edges, but other than that, it's a great way to save your documents/photos/pressed flowers, or whatever else you want to protect.",4
B00007E7D2,"I'm writing the review I wish I had been able to find before. Yes, you can run these self adhesive sheets through a laminator. These sheets laminate just fine on their own but they are ever so slightly cloudy when adhered to the paper. If you happen to have a thermal laminator you can run them through it and the sheet turns crystal clear, with a semi-matte/satin finish and they do NOT come off. I actually like these better than the thermal pouches for things like waterproofing cardstock without the added thickness or shininess or if you want to laminate only ONE side of your paper. You could also use an iron in place of a laminator to get that perfectly clear satin finish. I ran mine through in the 3mil heat setting, idk what it'd do in the 5mil hotter setting.",5
B00007E7D2,Very easy to laminate things but the only thing is I do feel like it makes a lot of bubbles in the finished product.,3
B00007E7D2,"This is the first time that I've done lamination, and once I develop a workable technique, I was satisfied with the results. The backing was designed to come off easily (a little seam near the top made this easy). It sticks like the devil, so you don't get a second change if you make a mistake placing the item.I laminated both sides, which generated a surprising amount of scrap - but that would be the case with any similar product.It is fairly clear when applied, not invisible, but OK.Technique: I was laminating photos as I printed them, and what worked well was to cut the photos oversized and laminate the oversized item. After both sides laminated, then cut to final size (e.g. with borders). Apply the paper starting at one edge and ""rolling"" it onto the sticky side. Wrinkles are forever if you do one by mistake.",4
B00007E7D2,will work for me well thanks,5
B00007E7D2,I purchased to use these sheets over crafted stickers.  They were very easy to use.,5
B00007E7D2,Great product!  Used to protect my cardboard book cover from the elements.,5
B0CPVCRD93,"I've been questing for good, not expensive, clear, hard, easy to use resin for a bit. Tried many varieties from Amazon and a few that I had to order directly. This Puduo is my favorite so far. The flashing cures hard and breaks cleanly, making my dice easier to finish. Mixing causes minimal bubbles, even with my resiners mixer. It dries crystal clear but takes color well. The pumps are great for less mess when doing just a couple sets of dice. Overall highly recommend.",5
B0CPVCRD93,"Pumps make it easier to measure and work with, it is a bit more thick at first than some of the resin I've worked with in the past but the results were great with minimal bubbles. Cures in 10hours most of the time enough to remove from molds and fully cures within 36 hours for some of the thicker pieces I've made. Good value for the price, I'll definitely buy again.",5
B0CPVCRD93,"This stuff was cheap compared to the stuff i was useing and i have to say it was a brezze to use, simple easy steps that are common to most ever other epoxy. Would rec this if you are doing wood projects. Will have to see how it sets up and if it yellows or what not.",5
B0CPVCRD93,"I like the resin, it was definitely easy to work with, and having the pumps makes it so much easier than pouring, but does take a little longer, but worth it without the mess. It hardened and no bubbles! Will be buying more from this brand. I did mix color and glitter in so as of now I can not speak of how clear it was.Only gave 4 stars because all the measuring cups inside were all cracked the whole length of the cups. Otherwise as described",4
B0CPVCRD93,"I turn wood bowls on the lathe and I use this on nearly every one. I've used it for several reasons. From repairing holes and cracks in the wood to making inlays in the rim. I've started using a coat of this before putting on wood Waterlox gloss wood finish. This helps stiffen up the grain which makes the bowl stronger while making me save on wood finish coats. The pumps on the 72 oz option work well once you get them primed. I was worried at first because the pumps took a long time to prime, but once they did, they measure out the epoxy well. 10 pumps of A and 10 pumps of B perfectly match every time.",5
B0CPVCRD93,"This epoxy has become my favorite. I have been using epoxy for hobby crafting for several years now, and I have struggled with an epoxy I had been using for awhile, I dont know what changed but I decided to start trying new products. Some very expensive failures and I have discovered this. Love it!! Strong recommend. Mixes well debubbles well, the pumps are awesome, and I have had zero issues. We'll, one, but that was my fault lol. I am a fan, and see continuing to use going forward. Strongly recommend. The size is perfect as well. Again, I am a hobby crafter, so I am not using gallons and gallons, and this size and price is perfect.",5
B0CPVCRD93,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was my first time attempting resin art and I would definitely buy this product again. I loved that the kit came with everything to get started. I feel the mix was easy to use and had low odor. I did get a lot of bubbles but I think that was mainly user error. I had a larger project that required almost the entire bottles of the mix and I found the cups and stirring sticks that came with the kit were too small for my project. Instructions were overall easy to follow as well. Overall I'm happy with this product.,4
B0CPVCRD93,I use this mold and your resin to make these lovely hands. I have never use this product before. I do love this resin it dries reasonable fast I just left it over night and it was cared over night.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Works well but I have had issues with bubbles,4
B0CPVCRD93,Quick turn around! I needed it in a hurry and they were great! Quality product!,5
B0CPVCRD93,"This resin is pretty clear and doesn't seem to hold a lot of bubbles, I gave it 4 stars because I thought the pumps would be good for ease of access, but they actually are kind of a pain. They only put out small amounts of resin w/ each pump and when I'm doing bigger projects it's really tedious to pump each one so much to get the desired amount. So I took them out and just pour straight from the bottles and it's fine. Overall I'm really happy with this product and the price I got it for. About 45-60min working time before it starts curing.",4
B0CPVCRD93,"It cures and looks great, but definitely requires ventilation in the work space.",4
B0CPVCRD93,Worthy the price,5
B0CPVCRD93,Good sourc,5
B0CPVCRD93,"quality product, as advertised - came with needed safety tools to complete the my work",5
B0CPVCRD93,I use this brand most of the time so if you are just starting out and don't have the money to invest too much yet  this is a good quality product at a some what affordable price,5
B0CPVCRD93,So the bottles are smaller then I thought they would be but none the less still a great product worked really well. Not as crystal clear as I'd like it to be but still a W in my book for the price.,5
B0CPVCRD93,i love using this brand  it cures really good i just wished i could afford more then a gallon i use alot .lolz,5
B0CPVCRD93,Like the less bubbles don't like how slow it is to pour when using the pump,5
B0CPVCRD93,Been doing epoxy crafts for a long time and this product is the best! No bubbles or yellowing!! Love it!,5
B0CPVCRD93,Works great,5
B0CPVCRD93,This item is perfect for pouring molds for art.Cures to a hard condition,5
B0CPVCRD93,"Instructions are surprisingly really clear and easy to follow. I like the extra things to keep your workspace and yourself safe. They give you gloves, measuring cups, some wooden stirrers, plastic sheets to put under your projects. I used a warm water bath to temper the mixed solution to avoid bubbles and it worked great!Avoid using the pumps- they pumped less than an ounce and then eventually got blocked up for me. I also weighed out my mixes and noticed the resin had an extra as compares to the hardening part.",4
B0CPVCRD93,Lamp made from a hollow slice of oak with sharks embedded in the resin,5
B0CPVCRD93,Christmas gift for son-in-law.  He's waiting until spring to use on his many DIY projects but is over the moon for receiving it.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Good value for the size but leaked when using the pump and became messy.,4
B0CPVCRD93,Using a 1:1 ratio can work but if trying to make dice or something that needs to be stiff then I'd advice using a .7 to 1 ratio as another review suggested,4
B0CPVCRD93,"This epoxy exceeded my expectations, no bubbles, set up quickly and well. My only concern is that after measuring every pour exactly, I was shorted 2 ounces of resin. While I plan to reorder, hoping that I receive equal parts of resin and hardener, I will look for another product if this happens again. I would have given it 5* if not for this issue.",4
B0CPVCRD93,"Did a great job,  amazing job",5
B0CPVCRD93,My very first-time using epoxy resin. It was easy to use. I had zero bubbles and the self-leveling was quite on point. I used it to decorate a tabletop for a nook in out hallway. So far it has been a huge hit. I am sure that the easy use of the product and how cute my project came out I will definitely be using more of this product in the future as I learn more.,5
B0CPVCRD93,This product is great. I work with all different kinds of resin and I have re-ordered this several times.,5
B0CPVCRD93,"Love the way it looks, and sets, very nice resin",5
B0CPVCRD93,I would of gave 5 stars but one of the two pumps doesn't work which is disappointing I tried this brand specifically for the pumps,4
B0CPVCRD93,Works awesome. No bubbling and easy to use. You don't need a lot of experience to use.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Done great for what I was wanting to do,5
B0CPVCRD93,Granddaughter is making and selling products with this item.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Great value for the money! Great product and amazing company! Will buy again for sure! Oh and fast shipping also!,5
B0CPVCRD93,It was good I thought it was a bigger bottle,4
B0CPVCRD93,Perfect,5
B0CPVCRD93,I've never used this present before so at first I was very nervous. But it turned out to be awesome I love it,5
B0CPVCRD93,"Easy to use and more working time than stated. I used a heat gun. My resin-topped table is bubble free and level. Follow the directions, and you will be pleased as well.",5
B0CPVCRD93,Odor isn't too bad. Haven't had anything turn yellow. Comes with some stuff to help ya out. The pumps are a big help easy for smaller projects.,5
B0CPVCRD93,I sealed artwork on bamboo and pine artwork. This resin dries crystal clear. Just follow the directions,5
B0CPVCRD93,"We just took our high school graduate and 4 friends to the beach before they all go off to college. This resin plus some jewelry molds and shells the girls found made for an inexpensive, rainy day friendly, and relatively simple way for them to have fun memories crafting together and everyone left with nice souvenirs.I did warm both bottles in hot water (microwaved for 2 minutes), measured carefully (recalling my high school chemistry labs for precision pouring), and stirred slowly to reduce bubbles. There were a few that surfaced an hour or so after pouring but a toothpick popped them and the pieces cured beautifully. Around the 2 hour mark we cleaned up the edges from some over poring accidents and then trimmed with sharp scissors around 8 hours (when they were firm but not super hard). They were fully hard around 12-14 hours (at the very humid Florida beach).",5
B0CPVCRD93,"I like the resin, it is clear and has a good curing time, takes color well, etc.  What I don't like is that I end up with too much part A at the end of the bottle.  The first picture shows a 16 oz set, near the end and there is twice as much part A as part B.  Thought maybe I made a mistake somewhere in the life of that set with my measuring.  But all my pieces hardened just fine.  The second picture is of an 8 oz set that I just used last night, and already you can see it will have the same issue as I near the end of the bottles.  I'll be throwing out part A, how does one dispose of that safely?  I have been using an electric scale, I tare the cup, add say 33 grams of part A, then pour in part B until I get to 66 grams.....so maybe this is NOT a good way to make sure you've got a 1:1 ratio?  Are the density of the two fluids that different?  Also, part B, the hardener, the foil seal on the top of this bottle is impossible to get off cleanly.  There is always little pieces that stay stuck to the top.....so when you have to pour over such a bumpy lip it gets messy down the sides of the bottle.....and this stuff is sticky.  In my zeal to get the little pieces shaved off cleanly, some ended up in the bottle, uggh!",4
B0CPVCRD93,Love working with this!,5
B0CPVCRD93,great for crafts and no stinky smell,5
B0CPVCRD93,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Product worked great on my canvas the shine made it look 100x better,5
B0CPVCRD93,This resin is easy to work with. It cures at an appropriate rate and has minimal bubbles.,5
B0CPVCRD93,I like this resin. I have never had any problems with it. It's definitely one of my go to products.,4
B0CPVCRD93,I really like this brand,5
B0CPVCRD93,Except the pumps don't work,4
B0CPVCRD93,"The resin is easy to use. However, you do have to watch out for tiny bubbles. I would suggest getting a vacuum chamber for this material",4
B0CPVCRD93,"I love the product, but if this is a 1:1 ratio they should send even amounts in the bottles. I got a full bottle of hardener and not so full bottle of resin. No biggie the product is awesome and I will buy it again. Just try to keep the bottles even next time.",4
B0CPVCRD93,"Ive used the midge podge resin, uv resin and this resin and a few others. I have to say that this was my favorite one to use.  My only complaint it that the pictures of the bottles are deceiving.  I thought I was ordering the gallon size of each that will make a total of two gallons.  Unfortunately each bottle is only 36 oz.  Other than that, I have no complaints. It starts to cure fast, so I hit it with a heat gun each time it started to thicken up too quickly and it made it easy to work with again.  I saw read the directions and follow them exactly as described and yoy wont be disappointed.",5
B0CPVCRD93,Works great. I especially love the obvious care to making sure the product is used safely and a newbie has all the safety equipment in this kit.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Love this resin. Great value. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the pump covers got stuck on after the first use. I had to twist the pump off and pour it instead.,4
B0CPVCRD93,"This works well ,the pumps make it easier for 1:1. But one of the pumps broke and stopped working. So back to making a mess. I still have half a bottle with the broken pump.",4
B0CPVCRD93,Came very secured and in timely manner. Sets up in 24hrs and is mostly crystal clear as described. No yellowing.,3
B0CPVCRD93,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love the fact that it's a pump. Great product, mixes well and dries nicely",5
B0CPVCRD93,"I purchased a few different brands of resin, being a newbee and not wanting to spend alot of money at the onset.  This changed my mind on quality and price, this did as advertised there are hardly any air bubbles and the pumps are an added bonus (especially if you have weak hands, such as myself).  I am trying different molds to get my feet wet boy, was this product the best!  It was easy to use, the one to one ratio is one thing I look for, quantity right now is important as I conduct my testing and refining my skills.  This was a very nice surprise and have bought more!",5
B0CPVCRD93,"I just received my order and everything was good until I got into the box. Looks like they just threw a bunch of stuff in there instead of packaging them together. Gloves, 3 popsicle sticks and disposable aprons just thrown in. Not to mention, one of the pumps is broken for the resin. I tried to reach out to the manufacturer, as recommended, but there wasn't any way to contact them. I may edit this review after trying the resin (haven't order d this brand before)...but right now, I'm not too impressed",3
B0CPVCRD93,I do a lot of resin casting for jewelry making.  This product works great!It's a simple 1 to 1 material ration and sets up in 24 hours to the point whereyou can sand it (which is what I do to achieve a matte finish).If you stir it thoroughly there is very little air bubbles in the mixture.I generally check my castings a few times in the first 30 minutes to punctureany tiny air bubbles that might form.So far.....this is one of the best resins I have worked with.Very happy with this product.,5
B0CPVCRD93,"This was my little test. Perhaps it was because my garage was cold, but the resin became more cloudy over time.It's easy to use, great value, just not clear as I thought.",3
B0CPVCRD93,First time I've bought this brand it's ok might be my fault on 2 of my medium projects one turned out hard and the other very bendable I've always used mixtopia brand bc it sets up rock soiled and no odor not really sure if I will be buying again it does have a sticky feeling on top coat,4
B0CPVCRD93,Turns out great,5
B0CPVCRD93,"I purchased because of the pumps that came with it.  But bottle A was hard to push on the first try, bottle B pushed so easily,  as time went along,  bottle B continues to work great, but bottle B continually needs cleared out,  and is still hard to push,What was handy was both bottles came with little green rubber caps for the bottles",4
B0CPVCRD93,Size of packaging was really nice for storage. Makes durable resin items. Definetly worth the money to get this bundle of stuff. Comes with everything you need to get started.,5
B0CPVCRD93,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have made a lot of different projects with this product. I have 4 stars only because the pumps didn't work for me. Other than that, it has no bubbles and it doesn't yellow over time like other brands. Great for beginners and different projects.",4
B0CPVCRD93,Easy to use pumps on Containers. Worked great on the resin coasters I made. Nice and clear and no bubbles as advertised. Dries overnight Comes with easy to use measuring cups. Would recommend for all your Resin projects.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Great workability time  and very accurate at 40 minutes.  Doesn't get too hot or smell at all. It's a bit runny at first as well. But the mix dries very well and glasslike clearness  no bubbles or swirls  it feels very hard as well like a solid rock.  Perfect for carbon fiber,5
B0CPVCRD93,I have used this epoxy too fill a couple knotholes in shelves and cast several switch plates. My daughter-in-law used it on a mug and my stainless water bottle and everything we used it for turned out great.,5
B0CPVCRD93,I love that the resin is bendable before it cures 100% . Once it cures it is durable and holds all the details of the mold. Love it.,5
B0CPVCRD93,Great resin but did not use pumps as one did not work.,5
B0CPVCRD93,"I like this resin because I feel that it's easy to mix, when you want the crystal clear look you get that and it mixes well with colors. Have been doing a large project lately so I have not used the pumps. I do like having that option.",5
B0CPVCRD93,"Very easy to use, worked much faster than I anticipated. Took maybe 5 min to set up and mix, 10 min to cover table top about 1/8"" thick. So thick and sticky that I didn't need to make a border for it. Just poured it out, spread it with a 4"" brush, checked it every 10 min or so to wipe up any dripping off the edges for about 30-40 min.Did use a heat gun to try and remove bubbles but it didn't really work that well. There are only 2 or 3 very small bubbles anyways.Table top is about 20"" x 84"".",5
B0CPVCRD93,No fumes no smell Great,5
B0CPVCRD93,"First time using epoxy of this type, happy with the results.  Low odor, could be used inside with ventilation.  Get a torch ready for bubbles, a few quick passes and they disappear!  Very happy and lots extra for other projects!",4
B0CPVCRD93,Worked perfectly,5
B0CPVCRD93,.,5
B0CPVCRD93,"Great price! Finish crystal clear,resin mixes well. Daughter made a wet look shirt and the product was not thick at all.",5
B0CPVCRD93,Not a happy camper here I just got my order and my epoxy resin is not full like it is on the other one they're both different as you can tell on the picture they have not been open yet the resin has less than the hardener I don't know why it's not level for both to be equally leveled one is less the other one is where it's supposed to be as you can tell in the picture you figure if some customer is paying like myself a lot of money then you expect to get the same amount in each bottle not one less than the other,3
B0CPVCRD93,Good value and quality.,5
B07TQKT16K,"I am absolutely thrilled with the Go Hang It! Pro! I was blown away by the ease of use and effectiveness of this hanging tool. The design is sleek and intuitive, making it a breeze to hang even the heaviest or most awkward items.I've used the Go Hang It! Pro to hang everything from picture frames to shelves, and it's been a game-changer. The magnetic hook is incredibly strong, and the adjustable strap makes it easy to customize the fit for any item. The included level is also a great touch, ensuring that my hangs are perfectly straight and level every single time!",5
B07TQKT16K,"I recently moved into a new house and have many pictures to hang.  Today I hung 17 pictures using this system in a couple of hours.HighlightsWhen using sawtooth hangers, the magnetic markers worked perfectly on every picture either with the hangers supplied or with others that I either had or were already on the pictures.  Some have complained that the magnets fell off or did not make a mark on the walls.  Not one fell off and every one left very easily visible marks on the walls.  Also I had no trouble holding the picture in place accurately while pushing to make the marks.  It does not take much force to put a small dent in drywall.When using the angled hook type hangers, the mark made with the included needle were easy to use but you have to compensate for the fact that the hooks are below the starting holes which is easy to do.The level included is very short but seemed to work just fine.Using the kit to arrange a large number of different sized frames on a long wall made spacing easy.People have also complained that the hang spacing for large frames is too close together but I hung some pretty large frames and so long as the wire is over two hangers the pictures were all easy to get straight and were very stable.ValueThe tool is probably worth about $15-20 in my judgement since it is probably a simple injection molding of inexpensive plastic but the features were all useful and you are paying for reducing the time otherwise spent in careful measurements with a tape measure and a level.The included set of hangers are similar to those sold on Amazon anywhere from about $7 to about $15.Overall I think this is a bit pricy but the time it saved me and the aggravation made it worth it.It is fastest to have two people working together, one to make judgements from a few steps back and one to use the tool and hammer in the hangers.",5
B07TQKT16K,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is a really simple tool to help eliminate any additional holes to your wall. The magnetic keys help mark a small dent on wall to know where you need to nail or screw in. Very fast and efficient! Great product. All you need is your own hammer and tape measure.,5
B07TQKT16K,I used it and most of the time pics are still tilted.  Best way to work for me is to use this then put some stick putty to center,3
B07TQKT16K,I've purchased this several times as a gift and it has only received rave reviews! Super easy to use and makes picture hanging less of a chore. Pictures don't wait months to be hung because of the hassle. No more holes all over the wall because it was slightly crooked or didn't line up. So efficient and user friendly!,5
B07TQKT16K,My new favorite picture hanging system. Change out hardware to this system so the magnetic keys can make their mark. I did use a laser level for location and this system got me on target first and every try. Very nice.,5
B07TQKT16K,"Don't normally write reviews all that much, but this product is awesome!  Used to have use a measuring tape to try and get the nail holes 'just right' from the ceiling, then move to level,  nail again.  End up with lots of nail holes and work for one picture.  Just hung a similar large picture with two sawtooth hangers using this.  Did it minutes and hung perfectly!  really works.",5
B07TQKT16K,"If you are someone like me, who lives alone and likes to decorate and hang frames, pictures, etc, then you NEED this product. This product helped me to mount degree frames, picture frames, canvas, small frames, wide frames, oversized frames, etc without having to phone a friend. Get it... trust me.",5
B07TQKT16K,This item makes hanging pictures very easy! I look forward to hanging new wall art now!,5
B07TQKT16K,Worked like a charm.  This was very easy to use and the video was excellent in preparing me to use it.,5
B07TQKT16K,We did an 8 picture picture wall and this truly made the hanging much easier than previous methods. I say buy one you will like it.,5
B07TQKT16K,"As a single mom/woman, this is the perfect tool to have around the house. I dread hanging pictures and this removed that dread. All the tools in 1 small container. Easy to carry around. With great instructions!",5
B07TQKT16K,"Very handy tool, once I figured out how to use it. Worth it just for the hardware. I just wish it had some instructions or suggestions for use.",4
B07TQKT16K,My only critique is I wish there were slightly better instructions but this is so amazing. Bought it for when we moved into our first home and makes me regret all the times we hung up things before. Bought again for my sister and brother in law. A necessity!!,5
B07TQKT16K,No more having to guess where I should put a nail or screw to hang things on the wall. I have received numerous compliments on how good all of our wallhangings look on the wall together.,5
B07TQKT16K,This is a great kid to have for hanging any types of pictures or artwork. It has a number of tools in it that allow you to adjust height and measure it to ensure that your products/art ends up being even on the walls.,4
B07TQKT16K,This product is so ingenious! It makes hanging anything effortless.Brilliant,5
B07TQKT16K,Made it super easy to hang pictures. Used my laser level and this together. One modification I made was to tie a string to one of the magnetic keys for frames with a lower anchor. Otherwise this thing is awesome,5
B07TQKT16K,"I have a track record of slanted pictures throughout my house. Decided to try this, my picture turned out evenly with minimum effort.",5
B07TQKT16K,This was a tremendous time saver!,5
B07TQKT16K,Best tool ever. Made hanging up a double claw picture SO freaking easy.,5
B07TQKT16K,"This is the third time I have used this tool and third time I have abandoned it in absolute frustration. The first were for a set of 4 large frames hung side by side. I followed the directions and placed marked the hole, but I had to make multiple guesses and thus multiple holes in my wall to get it right. The place where you mark is the place where the nail would go IF the hanger you are using was exactly the same size as the tool and none of the ones in the kit were the same! As well, I found it very difficult to use this tool on my own, especially with large and/or heavy prints. This last time I am hanging a group of four square pieces of art in a square. they have cleats on the back. The ""keys"" do not fit through the cleats so they do not work as intended. I tried to use them upside down, but they only marked every once in a while. I've been at hanging for over an hour with one still to go (about to quit out of sheer frustration) and this tool almost makes it worse because you think it's going to be simple, but instead I waste a half an hour messing with this stupid thing before I get out the masking tape and tape measure to do it the old way. Cannot recommend this tool. Highly advise skipping it especially if hanging medium or larger pieces.",2
B07TQKT16K,This was so much more than I expected. It allowed me to hang numerous pictures in our new home with ease. After you use it a while you'll be amazed at how easy it is to hang pic precisely. Great purchase!,5
B07TQKT16K,"This tool was handy when hanging pictures in a new home.  The instructions were unclear, but the issue was quickly resolved with a YouTube video.  I was able to use it 80% of the time.  The two instances where I couldn't use it were when the picture was too close to another one, or the picture was too high. I would buy it again.",4
B07TQKT16K,Product is good just not for me.,3
B07TQKT16K,"This product is great for hanging pictures. A very compact package. The housing is all plastic, but it is still built pretty well. This beats measuring and all that for hanging pictures.",5
B07TQKT16K,This thing is very handy and helpful for hanging a variety of pictures in the wall. I love the different types of tools it provides for marking the wall.,5
B07TQKT16K,I love this product. My favorite impulse buy so far. We recently bought a house and I have used this kit to hang over 20 pictures including a gallery wall. The actual hooks and nails are fine. The level and tools for marking the hooks are golden. I highly recommend it to anyone needing to hang multiple pictures.,5
B07TQKT16K,"This is really cool.  It does a great job and hanging (or preparing to install hanging hardware) for any wall.  The only reason this did not get a ""5"" is that it needs a more comprehensive and clear instruction sheet.  It is so feature-rich that one may not understand all it can do or how to do it.  I am experience at wall hangings and am still finding many cool features.The case is clever but a would really be great if the quality was higher, perhaps a type of nylon or sturdier plastic.",4
B07TQKT16K,"i've been doing home remodeling for 50 years, but I had a dollar for every picture of hung in my life my gosh folks I gotta tell you something I have never ever ever had so much ease and joy hanging pictures like in a collage on the wall, you have got to have this kit it's just a must have",5
B07TQKT16K,"I bought this thing, and after reading and playing with it and reading again, I still can't figure out how it's really supposed to be used.  It has some hanging bits and pieces that I've used, but the actual ""help me hang the picture"" part of this has been confusing and useless to me.  Maybe it me... it's really not obvious how to use it, though.",2
B07TQKT16K,"This product is just as easy to use as the adds claim, but for one issue.  For people with Cerebral Palsy this product suddenly becomes more difficult to handle.  The small components can't be held securely enough while the users hand trembles with uncontrollable shakes.",4
B07TQKT16K,"This bad boy makes hanging pictures, or anything you can imagine on the wall.I love that I finally have a little hack to make hanging stuff too easy now.Always dreaded hanging stuff due to fear of stuff not being level, or punching multiple holes in a wall for one thing.This product makes hanging anything a one and done situation.the magnets make finding hanging locations super simple, and this even has little products with it to hang different objects.THE ONLY TOOL TO GET STUFF HUNG THE FIRST TRY!",5
B07TQKT16K,"Very happy with the overall kit, it does save a lot of time specially if you have many pictures to hang and you're looking for a straight clean design.  The only issue that I had within 30 minutes of using it, was the little round magnet on the hanging key broke (see picture), I was able to put the broken pieces on the key since the little round piece is the actual magnet so I could finish my project.  I then went to see if they sold the keys in AMZN which they did for a low price of $9.99 + Tax...So, keys 25% the value of the entire kit should maybe tell you how often they brake?! Maybe not....overall, I'm glad I made the buy.",4
B07TQKT16K,Love it !!! Really easy to use and works well!!,5
B07TQKT16K,"So this tool really makes it easy for Anyone to hang their pictures. Ive always had my husband do it for me and even with this tool i was skeptical that it would be as easy as they said, but it really was. So we recently moved into a new home and we are decorating walls every day and i dont like having to wait for my husband to help me so when I saw this product i wanted it. The company has great videos that walk you through how to use it and it comes with all the tools you need including hardware. All you need is a hammer and this kit. My husband and i watched the videos and did the first picture together. It came out perfect and i really feel comfortable to do it next time on my own. Great gift for any men or women in your life who you know hang pictures a lot",5
B07TQKT16K,"Omg I cannot say enough good things about this.  Such innovative ways to make hanging pictures easy and perfect on the first attempt. If you have a frame that has two brackets instead of 1 in the center, this makes it absolutely seemless and SO fast.  Having it hold all of the materials was an added bonus.  Just incredible.",5
B07TQKT16K,"We used this for a decorating project and I'm never going back to hanging pictures the way I used to with 1238742498 measurements + math.I think I love everything about this product.It had everything we needed including:**The level made especially for wall hanging projects.**Accommodation for sawtooth and wire hanging situations.**Pin for marking wire hanging spots is RIGHT THERE and isn't easy to lose.**Keys for marking sawtooth hanging spots are sturdy and easy to install and remove from the kit.**Hanging hardware - hooks, screws, wire, nails. sawtooth fixtures are included and there is onboard storage for any future hardware we need.**Kit has a hanger built in to it so we placed it on our pegboard where we can easily find it for the next time.Seriously this was so thoughtfully designed. Totally worth the price. Get it!",5
B07TQKT16K,"Awesome make hanging pictures of breeze. This things shaved me a lot of time, also I have a few holes in my wall.. love this thang.",5
B07TQKT16K,"Finally used it to hang a bunch of pictures.  Watch the quick tutorial video and you'll have no trouble using it.  The magnetic keys alone make it worth it.  Don't know if you can buy those just by themselves.  It does give you a lot hardware for hanging to start with.  I've used two thumbtacks glued together to work similarly to the way the magnetic keys work.  This is way easier!  Picture hanging couldn't go any faster.  Yes, you're still going to measure to center things, but once you know where you want, it's a snap.  Highly recommend, although it is a bit expensive.",5
B07TQKT16K,"Used this to hang all sorts of frames.  Wire, loop, etc.  After a few times using this it became a breeze to hang everything.  Wish it had included some wire-clamps for wire frames to keep them from slipping, but I had some on hand to fix that issue.  Just refill with some hardware when you run out, and you're good!",5
B07TQKT16K,Love this gadget. got my frame up in a few minutes without extra and unwanted holes. I bought extra nails and hooks and accessories to fill out the attached case,5
B07TQKT16K,"Works great for those seemingly rare frames where the two different ways this can hold a picture can work. What I mean by that is, and at least in my case, that most all frames I have use those little triangle hooks, not a wire or sawtooth. I've ordered a bunch of sawtooth hangers to modify my frames which didn't cost much at all. This should allow me to use this tool more frequently. For the price, and the issue described, I'd argue that this is priced a bit high.",4
B07TQKT16K,"Doing things like a photo collage used to be such a challenge, but the ability to put the picture up, visualize where it's going to end up, and then just press it to the wall to mark the holes, literally revolutionized how I hang pictures.Includes everything you need to hang any kind of picture.  A complete solution to a formerly annoying problem.",5
B07TQKT16K,"I had my doubts me, but was pleasantly surprised how wonderful this.This little kid is.  So convenient.",5
B07TQKT16K,"When hanging a wire picture, it hangs lower than expected. Took a bit to figure that out, and it was kind of frustrating. Caused me to have numerous holes in the wall. Kind of expensive, so I probably should have returned it.",3
B07TQKT16K,I have always had problems with hanging pictures especially when they have two loops. This solved the problem. It was easy to use and I can't say enough good things about it. I hung 3 pictures in about the time it would have taken me to hang one. As an update I liked this so much I ordered one for my son. Now the difference is that the one I just ordered for my son is coming from China and taking several weeks. Still a good product but Amazon should let the purchaser know that is coming from China before buying. I would have made a different decision had that been told.,4
B07TQKT16K,Great product! Saves a good amount of time.,5
B07TQKT16K,This picture having kit is simple and easy to use. It made hanging my picture much easier.I am happy I took the chance and bought this product.,5
B07TQKT16K,I'm terrible at judging how high to mount the hooks to hang a frame to make it even with the other frames on the wall. This thing makes it so easy!! I'm happy I stumbled on it! Highly recommended!,5
B07TQKT16K,Does what its supposed to.  Made hanging a canvas easy,4
B07TQKT16K,It works sometimes but it's almost always 2 person and it doesn't really work without its own hardware installed on the picture which defeats the whole purpose. It's more of a pain than it's worth. I can't say I'd recommend it.,2
B07TQKT16K,Had a lot of options ans super easy to use.,5
B07TQKT16K,"I loathe hanging stuff and when I do have to hang something it usually ends up crooked.  So I figured I'd give this a try.My first issue more is about the packaging then the product.  Why in the world did they need to tape the Magnet Keys for shipping and what sort of tape did they use.  It left a really sticky residue on both keys which I've yet to be able to get off. (Yuck!)As for the Magnet Keys themselves while hanging I used them on D-Hooks the other day and they kept falling off.  When I finally did get it against the wall by holding it at an angle to keep them attached the photo ended up sliding before I could press it into the wall leaving a slight gash in the wall. (luckily its covered by the photo now).Lastly on the photos and video they show how easy it is to line up 3 photos.  This is really not the case.  Short of the level, nothing helps you line up the spacing between all 3 photos.  There is no way to tell how far apart you are from the other photos without bringing out the measuring tape.Now this isn't to say this is a bad product, it probably will make your life slightly easier when it comes to hanging but its not 100% full proof.",3
B07TQKT16K,Simplified the process of hanging frames.,4
B07TQKT16K,Works like it says in the included directions.  not sure why anyone would have trouble using it to hang frames.  If printed instructions don't clear up how to use it then watch the youtube videos.,5
B07TQKT16K,I like the compact kit and tools it provides helps making the level holes needed to hang things quickly. I was pleasantly surprised how fast I could hang things. Great product!!,5
B07TQKT16K,"When it comes to hanging things, there's no other tool quite like Go Hang It! Pro. This innovative product has transformed the way I hang items on my walls. With its unique design and user-friendly features, I can easily measure and mark precise locations for picture frames, shelves, and more. Go Hang It! Pro has truly exceeded my expectations with its durability and accuracy. Say goodbye to crooked frames and uneven spacing - Go Hang It! Pro is a must-have for anyone looking to achieve professional-looking wall displays effortlessly.",5
B07TQKT16K,"This is a great buy for the money. It is so easy to use and hang pictures way quicker. I used to get the measuring tap, the level and pencil. It would take me 5-10 minutes to hang a picture. With this, it is much easier and way quicker. you still have to measure if you want exactly in the middle of a wall or something but with the level and magnets it uses hole punch, it is awesome. I like the fact that it comes with hardware to mount pics as well. I would have bought just for the tool.",5
B07TQKT16K,It is a great tool for settling into a new home and all the decorating that is needed.  It is a one source for what you need to hang your pictures and decorations as you nest.  It provides all you need to hang your decorations except the hammer.,4
B07TQKT16K,I was able to use this product and it seems to be working good. I would have to say that I didn't give it a 5 star because I feel that it needs some improvements to the wat the case works. The silicon strap that has seems that might break easy and I would want to be able to hook it a little better. I would say that better magnets for the two hooks would be nice.,4
B07TQKT16K,"I've used this to hang items with wires and with recessed keyholes. There are enough accessories to hang several items. I would use hangers that are designed for heavier pictures, mirrors, etc. that may require two people to hang, but the kit makes it easy to hang smaller items without help.",4
B07TQKT16K,"Its so easy it's scary, there's no worrying anymore about something being straight and it makes things so much faster. Very impressed.",5
B07TQKT16K,"For bigger things it def is helpful if you have more than one person. I hung a mirror by myself and it had d-rings on the back. I was able to do it and it was fairly accurate but it did take me quite a few tries to have the level on the mirror and hold the magnetic peices, but this mirror was circular and big. So I recommend 2 people for bigger things but overall very useful and helped to prevent multiple holes in the wall.",4
B07TQKT16K,Worked the first time then broke.,3
B07TQKT16K,Wanted it mostly to hang large wire pictures I gave and it is too long to do that but otherwise it works with the smaller pictures fine.,3
B07TQKT16K,Pretty darned handy. Hanging my photos on my wall has never been easier.,5
B07TQKT16K,I have frames that have the long teeth and it could not hook into them to hold it was too fat,3
B07TQKT16K,Haven't used it yet but watched the demo online...looks great.,4
B07TQKT16K,Easy to use and perfect photo hang each time.,5
B07TQKT16K,"Pros...Makes hanging ""most"" decor fairly easy. It saved lots of time hanging 3 kids room decor after moving. Magnetic strips are nice.  The wire hanging part is very helpful. Leveler is nice since it can detach. I prefer the one I use in the shop better, but this did the trick.  Everything stores nicely and compact which is nice for saving some space storing it.Cons...The magnetic strips dont work well with any hanging hardware not attached to the frame itself. Any recessed hardware makes those almost useless because they wont make indentations. The level falls off often, hence why I liked my workshop one better.A bit on expensive side, but it is definitely worth it. I recomend it, and it they revamp and add magnetic strips that can handle recessed hardware, I'd buy that one too.",4
B07TQKT16K,The magnetic hooks can be a little awkward with certain kinds of hooks. I still recommend this for those who struggle with hanging things. Not recommended for larger pictures unless you have a second person!,4
B07TQKT16K,This product is amazing!  Hanging pictures was easier than ever before!!,5
B07TQKT16K,"I just bought a new house, and used this product to hang all of my pictures and decor on the walls.  The magnetic keys and built-in leveling device were my favorite parts.  They made it so much easier.  I didn't have to measure the distance between sawtooth hangers, nor was I concerned if D-rings on the back of a canvas were placed a little bit unlevel.  My measuring tape got very little use in wall decor projects.  I used quite a bit of the included hardware, so now I intend to replace it and have this item ready for the next use.  Go Hang It! Pro is a solid product, easy to use.  I'm glad that I took the time to find the original American-made product and didn't settle for the cheap imported Saker knock-off that I see advertised everywhere.",5
B07TQKT16K,"I am NOT a ""handy"" person at all.  I've lived in my house for over 2.5 years and hadn't put anything on the wall because I was pretty sure I'd screw it up and end up with fifty holes in my wall.THANKFULLY, the Go Hang-It Pro exists!!  This handy little tool helped me decorate my walls!No measuring required! (Which, to be honest, was one of the reasons I hadn't hung anything on the walls yet.  Everything frame I owned has two D-rings and having to measure for each one was just intimidating.)The only measuring I did do was to ensure the frames would be centered in the space I was planning to put it on. It's probably not -REQUIRED- but I did it because I suspect I might have OCD. ""Eyeballing"" it is probably just fine in terms of putting the frames in the center of a space.Thank you for making this product available!",5
B005KRSWM6,"Nice and precise cutting for crafts/repair, etc. Just don't slice yourself with it... The blade cover is useful for storage so it doesn't cut anything else. It feels very high quality in my hand.",5
B005KRSWM6,This was so worth the money ! Made the ability to cut very smooth. With the right size and flick of the wrist I was able to adjust the wallpaper properly ! It functions great ! Just be careful with the sharpness of the blade because it cuts so easily.,5
B005KRSWM6,This is perfect on stencils.The grip is hard It's very sturdy The blade is not very thick cuz it's a thin strong sharp blade but thick enough.Blade is sharp I've actually been poked twice but this is perfect for making stencils. I say it's a good price for what you get.,5
B005KRSWM6,This was perfect for my project needs - I only wish I had gotten it sooner. It is sharp and gets the exact angles and detail you need. Quick shipping and great price.,5
B005KRSWM6,"I used this X-acto knife to cut out Christmas decorations for our door, and i was very pleased with the precision attained with the knife, however once finished, i noticed the cap won't stay on, as I noted another reviewer also stated  having a defective cap.While trying to get the safety cap to stay, ironically trying to get the 'safety' cap to stay, was the reason i cut my hand...So in all, it's a great knife, but be cautious with applying too much strength to get the cap to stay on.I put a very small amount of duct tape rolled, with another small amount over it, and placed it on the cap's opening, just enough so the knife can fit, and it prevents the knife from just slipping off.  Safety first..",4
B005KRSWM6,"What can I say... it's an X-Acto knife! Sure, there are cheaper knock-offs, but the original is still the best.Securely locks blade in place and comes with a plastic cap to make it safer to store in a drawer.100% will buy again.",5
B005KRSWM6,I bought this to replace a cheap version I had. This is super sharp and the handle is high quality to lock in the blade. No reason to by a cheap knockoff when the real thing is so reasonably priced.,5
B005KRSWM6,"It's the basic, easy to use X-Acto knife, exactly what I was needing.",5
B005KRSWM6,Deducted one star because you will need to put grease or never seez on the blade holder threads to avoid getting it stuck.,4
B005KRSWM6,Love it,5
B005KRSWM6,"Great purchase for DIY projects. Used it to slice insulator on cables and it did exactly that (use a wire stripper if you can, this was a flat cable so I had to use this). Good price though.",5
B005KRSWM6,"The quality of the handle and the blades are absolutely the best I've ever tried. The blades are super sharp and hard enough. The handle looks awesome and dense. The knife alone is the best precision knife I can name. But when it is not just knife alone it is a bit different. The knife came with a cap with it, and it is not the best cap. To be honest I've tried other precision knives with caps and those are terrible too. There isn't any trouble with how tight and protective not even the quality of it. But the design of the cap is not smart enough. The golden part of the handle where the grip patterns are is where the cap would apply the force on to keep itself tight. There is an issue with this design, that the plastic of the cap would worn out on it. After pushing the cap on tightly, the plastic would grind out as dusk staying on the handle. That wouldn't make the cap endurable or pleasant to use. Overall, the knife is a great knife, only the cap is the trouble with it.",5
B005KRSWM6,I like simple colors for my desk.,5
B005KRSWM6,"After a few years of VERY casual use, the cap absolutely will not stay put on its own.  No resistance at all - it will slip right off.  I'm afraid someone will pick it up to just move it or something, and the cap will fall off and result in injury.Also, i find that the blade really wants to come out of the holder.  It screws down tight, but after a few minutes of cutting, the thing will slightly unscrew and the blade gets loose.  If you're cutting something grippy (even just cardboard), it can easily pinch the and the blade will stay lodged in your material.Finally, i find the pretty narrow body of the thing a bit of a pain to hold.  I wish it was just a bit thicker.  But this i can chalk up to a subjective need.I'm not sure if there are better options, but a better cap and a more secure system of holding the blade would be great.",3
B005KRSWM6,It cuts well,5
B005KRSWM6,Works well easy to hold.,4
B005KRSWM6,Great stainless steel razor knife very sharp great for making precision cuts,5
B005KRSWM6,Hands down the best!,5

Update: Amazon Folks sent me a generic link on how to post a video review which was not helpful at all. I resized the video to 400x225 from 1080p HD and I am hoping that Amazon will not mess this up too much in the video conversion process.-------------Update: The video quality here really is blocky and terrible even though I uploaded a 1080p crystal clear video. Contacted Amazon support to see what is going on------------Original review This is a great X-acto knife. Actually, this is my second X-acto knife. The previous one had the problem where the blade would loosen over time with just regular handling. This one, the blade does not tend to do that, so quite happy with it. The knife is plenty sharp so it can cut mostly anything that I intend to cut with it i.e. cardboard, plastic, paper etc. If I have to apply a ton of pressure, I would get a home-depot style cutting knife. I prefer to use the x-acto for precise cutting. The only con with pretty much all of the x-acto knives is that their caps tend to slide off easily. I like to carry my cutting knives in my pocket when I am working on a project - since I tend to misplace them all the time, so you can see that cap sliding off is fairly off-putting. Apart from that, it is a great knife. See my video review for its quality.",5
B005KRSWM6,"The X-ACTO XZ3601 No. 1 Z-Series Precision Utility Knife has been an invaluable addition to my toolkit. Its replaceable steel blade ensures sharpness for precise cuts across various materials. The safety cap adds an extra layer of security when not in use. The ergonomic design provides a comfortable grip, enhancing control and reducing hand fatigue during prolonged use. I've used it for intricate crafting projects, cardboard, and even light DIY home repairs, and it's performed admirably in every task. Overall, a reliable and precise utility knife that's become my go-to for all sorts of cutting needs. Highly recommended for its durability and precision.",5
B005KRSWM6,It only just arrived this afternoon. However it is all in its original blisterpack and I assume it is as excellent a tool as it always has been.,5
B005KRSWM6,"I purchased this knife to assist me in building Gunpla models. After using it exclusively for a while, it has become my go-to brand. It works great for cleaning up leftover bits of plastic on model parts.The blades are nice and sharp right out of the box and hold an edge very well (make sure you keep the cap on when not in use!). Some of the cheaper brands I've tried out are fairly dull and lose what little edge they have after cutting only a handful of pieces. Changing the blades out is very easy.The handle feels solid in your hand which is a huge plus for me. It has a knurled metal grip near the blade which helps you keep your grip when working with hard-to-cut items. The size of the handle is sufficient for me, it stays comfortable even when I'm on a multiple hour model-building binge.My only minor complaint is I've had caps that don't want to stay on super tight, but this hasn't caused any major issues for me.  If you're looking for a good hobby knife for plastic model building, look no further.",5
B005KRSWM6,i use to cut leads on boards. very useful. i still use to this day 2024 . i bought back in 2015.,5
B005KRSWM6,"Very sharp and worked well for the task I had. However, be careful getting it out of the package. The protective plastic over the blade flew off upon opening, and I stabbed my thumb. It bled quite a bit... all over my sink, my shirt, my countertops. It looked like a mini massacre had taken place in my bathroom. My husband walked in and thought I had finally given in to my threats about our demon cat that attacks the walls at random while growling and hissing...until Fluffy McLucifer walked in and began to lick the blood that had dripped on the floor.While I do not recommend using this tool to harm any animals because that's just plain wrong, I strongly suggest putting it aside in your underground bunker to use as a weapon in case of a zombie apocalypse.",5
B005KRSWM6,"X-Acto says that the Z series is sharper and more durable than other models - I can see that!They say that they are the sharpest blades in the industry - I don't know if I can verify that, but they sure are sharp.- These blades seem to last quite a bit longer before needing to be sharpened or replaced.- The style of this knife is pretty standard but feels nice in your hand. The gold bit is a nice touch.- It is all metal and has a good feel and a good weight to it.- This set doesn't come with any extra blades but they're cheap to buy and easy to replace.- I haven't had any problem with the blade becoming loose with use, like I have with other brands. It only unscrews when I want it to.- I just have to deduct a star because of the cap. I hate the cap. I feel like it's not going on tight enough, and if I push it too hard, I'm terrified it'll break on me. Realistically, it won't, and I know that... but I just really don't like it.- Besides the cap, it's a very high-quality great craft knife that will last far longer than the generic plastic ones I also own.",4
B005KRSWM6,"I have used this type of trim knife for over 50 years. This is the basic changeable blade knife, it has many practical assorted blades that can be purchased to make the knife more adaptable to your specific hobby or work needs",5
B005KRSWM6,"I use this in my greenhouse, for trimming leaves, limbs, etc.  I can get into tight places, and do the job.",5
B005KRSWM6,"I've used Xactos for decades for modeling/hobbys.  I wish they'd update the handle so it doesn't allow the knife to roll all over the place.  Maybe a hex or octagonal shape.  Also, mine came w/ a blade that failed the sharpness test of cutting a sheet of paper cleanly.  Maybe I was unlucky.  I bought a Tamiya retractable hobby knife for $5 and it's so much better ergonomically (ie easy to hold & won't roll off the table) and sharpness.  The only thing I don't like about it are the limited number of blades (5) to snap off.A dull blade is really good at cutting flesh more than what you're trying to cut/score/etc...  Also, a sharp blade rolling around is dangerous.  The cap keeps it from rolling but is kind of inconvenient & cheaply made.",3
B005KRSWM6,Rather dull for a precision cutting tool.Would not buy again.,3
B005KRSWM6,"I've been using X-Acto knives since the sixth grade when I discovered them. They have been immensely helpful in life and I have them at home, school, and work.I already had two X-Acto knives at home, but I'm drawn to shiny new objects, so when I saw this gold handled knife with sharper blades, I had to have it. It looks like the regular #1 knife, but with a gold-colored grip area to indicate that this is a sharper version with a ""Zirconium Nitride-coated blade."" The blade cuts through things effortlessly, but it's a new blade so I'll update over time on how long the sharpness lasts. Included is a blade cover which goes on tight (and gives a screeching sound when you put it on).As the sharper blades are the same size as the regular #1 blades, I may just upgrade all my blades to these. There is a #2 version of this knife with a bigger handle and bigger blade, but for some reason there are no sharper #2 refill blades.This is a great crafts knife that is incredibly handy to have. Recommended.",5
B005KRSWM6,Very disappointed in how quickly this product broke. The mechanism that holds the blade in broke after only some light use.,2
B005KRSWM6,"The knifes gets 5 stars.  The caps get nothing.  I ordered 3 and they all fit with slop.  Turn the knifes down and the caps fall off.  It did on all 3.  Hey X-ACTO are you listening to your customers complaints abour your caps?  Bring back the old caps that stay on.Easy fix.  The part on the cap on the side that is slotted, with the dimple on the inside to grab the knurled blade cap.  This is molded too straight to the body of the cap putting no pressure on the knurled blade cap.  At the base of this tang where it meets the rest of the cap, heat with a lighter about 2 inches away for 7-10 seconds to warm the plastic.  Then push the tang in on the end about 20 degrees off plane.  Hold until plastic cools.  Your cap now will never fall off until you take it off.",5
B005KRSWM6,I bought this specifically because it has a safety cap. I have a ton of handles and blades but I didn't have a single safety cap. I decided I wanted to keep an x-acto knife among a jar of my most used craft tools but I didn't want to have an exposed blade so I bought this. The handle is very good quality but I do occasionally have issues with the handle loosening and the blade falling out. I just started tightening it every time I use it so I don't have to worry about it falling out again. The safety cap fits nicely and is very heavy duty. Great purchase and I don't have to worry about grabbing for a knife and cutting my fingers. I wish I could have purchased multiple safety caps to keep on all of my blades but I don't think they sell just the caps. This purchase was well worth the price and I can always use extra handles and blades.,5
B005KRSWM6,"The knife itself is fine, but even when I bought the knife three years ago, the cap would unfasten easily. Simple gentle tapping against something, or rubbing against something is all it takes to have it totally loose. I don't use it every often at all, but this year, the cap simply doesn't fasten whatsoever. No visible difference on it, nothing is bent, chipped, or discolored. The next time I get a similar knife, I will try to find something that snaps or latches shut. Hopefully I just got a bad one somehow. Otherwise, these could really hurt someone.",2
B005KRSWM6,I use exacto knives a lot and this is a great one that fits well in my hand. The one problem I ran into was that the cap doesn't stay on tight like others I have had. That would be my only gripe.,4
B005KRSWM6,"This one works fine but because the barrel is so narrow, it hurts to use after a while. Fisker makes one w/a wide barrel which is more comfortable. Also don't get the X-acto one w/the wide rubber grip. That one stops holding the blade and the dye bleeds on your fingers.",3
B005KRSWM6,don't try to cut something unless you want it cut.  its sharp.,5
B005KRSWM6,"I bought this four years ago. I use it only a couple times a year. The blade always slips out. I should've reported it sooner, but I rarely use it, so I always thought I just have to be careful not to cut myself and that I have to keep putting the blade back in when it slips out. It's starting to get annoying, though. Today I was using it and the blade kept slipping out and getting stuck in the cardboard I was cutting. The cardboard is thin and the part I'm cutting is perforated, so it should be easy to cut. After four years of the blade slipping out every time I use it, I'm just done with it. I don't think it is supposed to slip out like this.",1
B005KRSWM6,"It holds the blade fairly well. Easy knurl to grasp and twist. The blade may ""pull out' if not firmly tightened.This is a basic holder. A nice grip, good weight, and good size.I'm not in love with the round design but wanted a basic knife with a good blade for simple chores.Of interest, there is not a surgical knife in the world that uses a round, pen style holder. They are all flat to allow control of rotation and to give the user a sense of blade position.It would be nice if they made a more typical ""surgeons style"" handle.The ergonomic ones look nice, but the bulk and size is unnecessary.This one is better for fine use....I wish they made this as a flat handle",4
B005KRSWM6,"I bought this X-Acto knife on the recommendation of some bloggers who do Scherenschnitte and silhouette cutting because, for Christmas, I did two silhouettes--one of my son, the other of my niece--for my mother. I am by no means an expert at fussy-cutting, but I know having the right tools makes beginning efforts and learning technique a heck of a lot easier. Based on their recommendations, I purchased this knife for a very reasonable price, and when I received it, I was pleased to see how sharp it was. It's long enough to feel weighty in the hand but comfortable enough for pencil-like grip to hold it. It was indeed very sharp, and cutting out eyelashes, lips, and bangs--and especially ""highlights"" in the hair--was much easier with this blad. I have used other blades just picked up in stores without much research, and I did indeed get a much better, more precise cut out of these.I'm still not an expert, but this novice came out with two silhouettes that clearly looked like the children I intended, so that's got to say something for this knife, right?",5
B005KRSWM6,"Handle seems great, I wish I could test it out. Thankfully I don't need to use it immediately",3
B005KRSWM6,Dulled after just cutting a thin rubber matt!  Don't bother.,3
B005KRSWM6,"The cap is so shoddy, it break at the first attempt to remove it. The acto knife is super sharp - so once the cap is gone, you are at risk for major misshaps unless you store the knife in a box of some kind.",4
B005KRSWM6,"X-Acto Knife handle will not lock in the blade. No matter how tight you turn the handle adjustment, you can easily remove  the blade by hand. This is supposed to be X-Acto's premium Knife. Returned product, awaiting replacement hoping this was just production error and not a design flaw.",1
B005KRSWM6,This is great,5
B005KRSWM6,"First off, the pros. The knife is sharp and the grip is good. It has a good weight to it that's comfortable in the hand. All in all, it does what it says it does, gives you a nice little knife to cut through some thinner materials with precision.But this version had two major flaws for me:- The cap is very loose. It's not loose enough to fall off just by shaking, but any bit of force on the cap will knock it off. This proved a problem for me when carrying it around, as the cap came off and I ended up pricking myself on the blade.- The blade holder is screwed at the top of the knife, so it can come undone when you're working with the knife a lot just from the motion you make. I've had the blade fall off unexpectedly several times as a result.I use the X-Acto mainly for opening packages and cutting materials at work, so this probably won't be as much of an issue if you're using it for crafts or somewhere stationary like your desk. But if you're more active with your X-Acto knife, it can be dangerous. I'd recommend the Gripster version in that case as that addresses the issues this one has.",3
B005KRSWM6,"Good quality and very sharp, perfect for cutting paper. My only issue is that my cap doesn't like to stay on, I've been taping it to prevent me from accidentally  stabbing myself.",4
B005KRSWM6,"Exactly what I needed for the job, but if I worked on it for too long at a time it cramped up my hand. Always have these around the house because I use them for a million different things. They usually hold up well and the blade tends to be sharp for a long time.",4
B005KRSWM6,"I apparently misplaced my old x-acto knife handle and needed a new one, so I gave this a shot and figured I'd try out the new blades.1) The handle is the same no frills handle that's been around forever, but with a gold anodized bit. I prefer a bit more heft, but it works.2) The cap is awful. It doesn't really stay on. The caps have historically not been awesome, but they have reached a new level of not functional since I last purchased a handle with a cap about a decade ago.3) The blade. Well.. It's ""sharper"", it's pointier, it holds an edge longer, and it STINKS for my purposes. To get it sharper and pointier, they appear to be very slightly thinner metal, have adjusted the angle of the grind (and appears moved to a hollow grind), and moved it a bit further into the meat of the blade. The net result is that the tip is very, very thin, and rolls over very easily. I thought it might just be me, but I ordered a 40 pack of the plain vanilla #11 blades, and they behaved exactly as I was used to. They aren't a total failure. For some cutting, the edge change and treatment will be useful. I'm just not sure that it will be 30% better which seems to be the premium on these blades over the basic #11.For reference, the bit I use them for where they totally stink is cutting out of heavyweight 100lb card stock, heavy bristol, etc. If I were doing high volume, I'd probably go for a #4 stencil blade anyway, but it's not like I haven't used a #11 for this in the past without this kind of hassle, and the normal #11s I switched to after burning through this one blade worked fine too.",2
B005KRSWM6,saw the reviews and bought one to cut plastic off my model kits but when it came i found that it kinda had trouble cutting and on closer inspection found out that one of the sides were defective. not sure if im unlucky or this is just the level of quality from this brand.send it back for a replacement to see if its still like this.,4
B005KRSWM6,I liked that it was a knife because that's what I ordered. I used it to make star wars cut out snowflakes.,5
B005KRSWM6,"I bought this as a replacement for my previous X-Acto knife, which I guess was a #1 blade. The #11 blade felt immediately like a step up in sharpness and sturdiness. I tried it out cutting open the tape on a box, and it's like sweeping through air. I bought it to work with miniatures, in particular for trimming supports; I needed an intermediate tool between a box cutter and a thin and flexible tamiya craft blades. So far I'm very happy with it.",5
B005KRSWM6,"I don't know if I got a bum batch or what, but the hype surrounding these gold blades, to me, is 100% unfounded. Out of the package, it couldn't cut a layer of scotch tape and like 25# paper without snagging and dragging. I thought, ""Hey, maybe the tip got banged up in transit"" so i tried cutting a piece of regular printing paper with the middle of the blade (what would be the belly on something rounder). No soap. like cutting a tomato with a toothbrush. The gold blades are exceedingly thick, maybe that has something to do with it? This is not an indictment of the x-acto brand: i love x-actos in general and have been using them since i was 8. The handle is fine, the gold collet just a touch of swag in an otherwise plain aluminum stick. Oh right, also the cap sucks. Two out of the three reasons I went for this package were garbage. It's too loose. It slides around like a cartoon landlubber on a boat. Still, right now these bad boys are cheaper than a regular aluminum-colored handle with no cap and 5 regular blades, so if you've got the blades and want the touch of gold that'll make your friends finally respect you, go for it. Maybe yours will be better than mine.",3
B005KRSWM6,"the handle is solid and leaves you feeling confident when you grip it.the blades are sharp, yes, but also a bit flimsy. i can't notice any difference between the regular exacto blades and these gold-tipped ones, but i can say that it isn't rugged enough to really slick into a box. more for tape, paper and plastic.it's a bit awkward getting it back into the cap, but it's the same design they've been using for years. it skeeves me out when i try to put it in and it isn't right. make of that what you will.it's a solid product, but dont' get carried away and try to use it for anything too thick.",4
B005KRSWM6,"If you are a writer, a graphic artist, a maker of homemade birthday cards, or if you just need to cut something and scissors won't do the job, this x-acto knife is an indispensable tool.  Whether you are cutting a long straight line or a tiny, intricate interior piece, this x-acto is the tool you want. It is a high-quality, reasonably priced x-acto, a newer, sharper model and more comfortable to hold than the old ones I used to have. The cap is a bit awkward to use; it took awhile for me to figure out the correct position for it, and it seems much longer than it needs to be. On the other hand, I'm happy to have a cap to keep the blade from damage, either to you or to it. Be sure to buy extra blades: the Z series #11 blades are recommended, and the 5-pack will last for quite awhile.",5
B005KRSWM6,The blade easily comes out. I like to plan with stickers and this is the perfect tool to avoid those stickers over hanging  issue however this blade easily comes out and I have small children.  My biggest fear is the blade accidentally falling out and my child stepping on it. I am trying to prevent that by carrying it inside another case however I am looking for another exacto knife by another company if so I will toss this in the trash. My kids safety comes before a pretty planner EVERYDAY.,4
B005KRSWM6,Arrived quickly. Good for hobbies,5
B005KRSWM6,"I purchased this as it was recommended to trim wallpaper. Amazon should not recommend this with wallpaper because it is not sturdy or strong enough to handle sticky and thick wallpaper. This knife is great for smaller projects, but not for something as heavy duty as what I was looking to use it for. The blade continually fell out every time I tried to trim the wallpaper. I finally had to go get my heavy duty box cutter to complete the job. I did keep this knife because I could see myself using it in the future for small projects.",4
B005KRSWM6,"Works as expected - quite sharp and cuts easily. The reason I took one star off is because the caps on these loosen over time. They've never left the desk I use them at, I've never dropped it before - yet 4 months later the cap isn't as tight as it was on the first day and now falls off. This is the second one I bought. The first one's cap did the same thing after a few months as well.",4
B005KRSWM6,"First time when I bought, I bought because it said easy to change blade with all other good point. Quality was great but I tried to change blade several times, I couldn't. I was very frustrated, disappointed & returned to Amazon next day. I emailed frustration & problem I had, felt so bad to X-Acto email address. It was surprised they responded & understood my frustration & problem & said will send another one without even charge with letter mailed. I didn't expect such kind of service but It was very nice feeling co. understood customer's problem & care.  Great!  Thank you",5
B005KRSWM6,The blade in this X-Acto knife is a little loose and if you are cutting any type of sturdy/harder material it will come out of the grip. The blade is a little flimsy and is hard to keep straight if you are applying pressure,4
B005KRSWM6,I had to do a lot of intricate cutouts.  It stayed sharp and helped my cuts stay accurate.  No wandering off the marked lines.  And no hand fatigue.,5
B005KRSWM6,Blade is extremely sharp and easily makes precise cuts. Comfortable to hold and to handle.,5
B005KRSWM6,"I bought this because I need an X-Acto knife for precise cutting and small projects, and it does the job, but the blade comes out easily and the knife itself isn't very sturdy. I've had the blade be close to falling out or actually fall out multiple times, which always makes me nervous. I like that you can buy replacement blades (even though it doesn't come with any) but I don't like that it never feels secure and I'm always worrying about the blade falling out. It feels cheap, maybe there's a better, sturdier version sold in stores or something. I'd recommend this product if you need a quick fix or something, but I'd be careful.",3
B005KRSWM6,"Used this to cut a gasket out of a sheet of rubber.  The blade is very thin, which makes it extremely sharp but also a bit fragile. So be careful not to apply too much pressure when using it.  The handle is solid metal and feels like it will last forever.  I anticipate snapping a blade every now and then, but haven't yet (knock on wood) and when that happens, it will be easy to replace just the blade.  A good tool for fine cuts.",5
B005KRSWM6,"It's just a trim knife.  I normally buy the ""Gripsters"" as they hold the blade and they hold it tight! Like every of the 473 other Exacto's I've had like this one, the blade always loosens at the most inconvenient time. If you're familiar with these then you know what I mean. If you're not familiar, know that the positive is the blades and the negative is the handle. If you're only doing straight line cuts/timming, these are fine. If you want to actually use the thing for a tool then hang up the phone and get the Gripster. They cost more, but they're worth it. Or you can be stubborn and get one of these because it'll be ""good enough"", then you find out it's not good enough so you'll grab some plyers and tighten the shit out of it (without stripping the threads) and be proud of yourself because you outsmarted it. Then at the most inconvenient time...",3
B005KRSWM6,"I don't use this multiple times daily as some do, but often enough when I need something more precise than a utility knife.  I'm submitting a review, more for the blades than the knife handle itself, because I'm still using the blade it shipped with when I purchased it here on amazon...in January of 2012.  I'm giving it just 4 stars because they could come up with a better cap and the handle absolutely could use some redesigning.  It's a tool after all and shouldn't require extra care when capping the blade nor should it require tightening to keep the blade secure.  Veteran users may be familiar with changing blades but that whole process is anything but intuitive until you figure out how it's done.",4
B005KRSWM6,"I bought on sale and paid around $4 which, for a very simple knife, 1 blade and a safety cap which absolutely does not work.  Even if the safety cap worked I think that I significantly over paid.  However, I will keep it because its not worth the hassle of returning and I was able to fix the safety cap issue.The safety cap on its own was useless as it would just fall off on its own because there was absolutely no tension for it to hold onto the knife.  I fixed this by using a small wad of paper and electrical tape to force the tension tab down enough so it will hold the cap onto the knife.  Still not super secure but at least the cap does not fall off on its own.My recommendation is buy something else.  There are lots of similar products most of which come with extra blades for the same price.  Suggest looking at Fiskers.",2
B005KRSWM6,"It works well enough, but I have dirty exacto blades in my toolbox with sharper edges than the one that comes with this.",3
B005KRSWM6,"Its a good firm cutter, can be used in textile, minor wood works, paper cutting, etc. The only thing is that the handle is a bit narrow on the top, I would prefer instead wider at the top, so that my hand slips more towards the middle in order to apply more pressure, but generally its a good built product, and affordable too, think this way, in hope depot one would cost $9.99, takes my gas to drive there and back + my time, I rather buy Prime and get it next day then half of the price.",5
B005KRSWM6,"Sturdy easy to handle easy to use, with easy to replace blade.This X-acto knife does X-actly what you need for precision cutting with any art's/crafts or other projects you need to make perfect cut.",5
B005KRSWM6,"It works great and does its job, but the sharp tip does fall out. I kept having to look around on the floor for it, nervous someone would cut their feet, and re-connect it back in. So just be mindful with it",4
B005KRSWM6,"I love how well this cuts, how sturdy it feels in my hand, and the sleek design. The only problem I have with it is the same problem I have had with every x-acto knife I have owned, which is the blade wiggles loose extremely easily. I have to tighten it constantly and sometimes the blade just falls completely out. Any suggestions to remedy this would be great. I also wish the protective cap would stay on better and not just fall off. This is still my favorite x-acto I have owned despite this. Would recommend.",4
B005KRSWM6,Solid hold of the knife blade if you can get the collet to turn hard enough. i use pliers as i can't get enough force to get it to stick.,4
B005KRSWM6,"Great little knife for fine work anywhere in the house, but mostly for delicate cutting in artwork.  If U use any of the sticker books Amazon has, U'll need this cutie pie, as sticker carry background color of page. TERRIFIC for collage, junk books, any fine art work.  Very handy.  Highly recommend.",5

B097D7S6KB,"Inexpensive, simple to use, innovative, and wicks are of good quality.",5
B097D7S6KB,Made a few Crisco candles and used this kit. Was super fun and inexpensive!,5
B097D7S6KB,Easy to use just great product,4
B097D7S6KB,"These wicks and tools are exactly as advertised and work really well.  Very pleased with the items.  The wicks burn well, but not so well they flame out and keep your homemade candles burning longer with no odor from the wick itself and just the pleasing aroma of the candle you make.",5
B097D7S6KB,"I love that there were 3 different lengths of wicks! It was my first time making candles, and the kit came with every thing I needed to strengthen my new found hobby obsession!",5
B097D7S6KB,I am so impressed with these wicks! They burn much slower than the original candle did so my candles should last a long time. I'm not a candle maker so the kit makes is super easy to reuse the wax from my warmer and old candles. It's easy enough to make me think about taking up a new hobby!,5
B097D7S6KB,Nice wicks. Easy to use. Burn well and last a long time. I got over 36 hours of burn time with these. Good value.,5
B097D7S6KB,Just what I was looking for. Arrived quickly. Came with all described pieces. Works as it should.,5
B097D7S6KB,"I am not a candle maker. We bought this because my kids desperately wanted to make candles one time to give as holiday gifts. I went with what was well priced and seemed to have decent reviews. The general feedback we have gotten so far is that the candles burn pretty well. I can't comment on much more than that, seeing as how our experience with candle making is limited to this one time!",4
B097D7S6KB,"Others shared there is a scent; however, no scent from my batch. Its neutral. Added to another candle and waiting to see how it performs.",4
B097D7S6KB,Great exactly as expected,5
B097D7S6KB,Like the tools that come with the wicks.Burn great!,5
B097D7S6KB,Awesome product  !!!,5
B097D7S6KB,"Awesome product, just wish they came with a way to store them!! Reusable bag or something because this scatters easily!",4
B097D7S6KB,"The wicks are thick, the pads to glue the wicks down are really strong. The size is perfect for many sizes of candles. It also comes with labels. You get a lot for the money. I've made candles to give as gifts, so I cannot tell you how long the wicks burn or anything that has to do with burning the candles. I will be buying these again in the future.",5
B097D7S6KB,I've made approx 5 big beeswax candles since getting the set and they're so easy to use.,5
B097D7S6KB,Muy buen producto gracias.,5
B097D7S6KB,Very good quality.  This was my first time making a candle and this helped make it so easy.,5
B097D7S6KB,Good value and works great,5
B097D7S6KB,"Just started making candles and I love the woodwicks, so got these.  Worked fine.",5
B097D7S6KB,Great value  nicely packed  helpful item,5
B097D7S6KB,Worked and it fit.,5
B097D7S6KB,Great,5
B097D7S6KB,"The tools to keep the wicks up only work for smaller candles/tea lights in terms of diameter, and even then they can only hold one wick properly at a time. Glad to have gotten these on sale at least and have the different wick lengths  for future endeavours....",3
B097D7S6KB,Love them but wish they wouldn't burn down so quick,5
B097D7S6KB,This is a great starter kit for anyone getting into candle making. it comes complete with all of the tools and a number of wicks at varying lengths allowing for a variety of candles to be made. I like using these with beeswax to make the candles.,4
B097D7S6KB,Excellent product,5
B097D7S6KB,Loved using this! WillUse this again!,5
B097D7S6KB,"Good product , burns slow , could use better clamps on the top of wick when pouring the wax.",3
B097D7S6KB,My daughter enjoyed making candles.,5
B097D7S6KB,"Bought these to get more burning time with my candles. I always have wax in the bottom of the jars when the wicks are done, and now I can pour that wax into another jar with a new wick and not loose any wax.",5
B097D7S6KB,"I am  on my second purchase. The stickers work great, the wicks work well on my single wick and triple wick candles. Great deal and quality wicks. Neat little kit that even includes a wick centerer and holder.",5
B097D7S6KB,"I had a fun time melting down remnants of old candles and making new ones with this product.  The green hair clip is confusing though.  I did make use of it but the curve in the clip prevented me from getting the correct placement of the wick.  Other than that, it's definitely worth the money to be able to combine old candles into new ones and get more life out of them.",4
B097D7S6KB,I think this is really good because it has everything in one pack. The wicks were great and sturdy. The stickers however to adhere to the bottom of the glass jars they don't stick at all after a month so if you buy this make sure you use it quickly. If not then you can use a hot glue gun t the bottom of the metal piece of the wick and throw out the stickers not worth the time to put it on if they are non-adhesive. The extra clips to use were nice but defitnelty need more if you are working on more than one candle at a time.,4
B097D7S6KB,Thanks,5
B097D7S6KB,Was exactly what I needed and advertised.,5
B097D7S6KB,Como paquete esta bien,4
B097D7S6KB,I made homemade candles that smelled wonderful and was also an insect repellent. I placed them in my yard and it burned so easily. I also liked that it came in different sizes so I could try them out,5
B097D7S6KB,"I used these wicks in Beeswax candles & they barely stayed lit. I am not sure what they are coated with, but seems like plastic. They are useless to me.  I had to remelt the candles and put in Hemp wicks with beeswax coating instead.  Save yourself the headache and don't purchase for Beeswax candles.",2
B097D7S6KB,"We have several candles that burn really hot and the wick is unusable well before the wax gets low. We trim the wicks, but it still leaves us with a half burned candle. This was perfect to allow us to remedy that. We heated up the candle and wax in a double boiler and removed the old wick base and installed a new one. Problem solved! Now we can also reuse really nice looking jars and holders that would usually get tossed out. Plan to use this a lot more. There are two different wick thicknesses, a clip to hold it in place while the wax cools, and labels and tags (in case you want to gift them to friends). I recommend this for anyone wanting to do some light candle repairs or making. Enjoy!",5
B097D7S6KB,I suck at keeping the wick down with the clips lmao but the wild are perfect I just need to perfect my way of making candles,5
B097D7S6KB,"I was surprised with the quality of this product, without a doubt the best money invested, the opinions of other buyers influence which is the best option, without a doubt it is this, five stars.",5
B097D7S6KB,"We have some Y----- Candles that burned up their wick before half way. We ended up drilling a 1/2"" hole in 4 spots and stuck these in and Walla!!! We light 2 at a time and working great. Just add in the wax you drilled out. Just extends the life of those candles. I am sure these would work fantastic in New candles also. They are very sturdy.",5
B097D7S6KB,"These work great, easy to use the product itself doesn't feel cheap and they do burn easily with no hassle.",5
B097D7S6KB,I don't make a lot of candles. It is very nice to be able to make one purchase and get what you need without having to buy enough for my whole state!,5
B097D7S6KB,Decent kit. Wicks are OK burn wise. Had some fun making candles using recycled wax and glass. Problem is the wicks don't stay stuck to the bottom. They float around.,3
B097D7S6KB,The metal tabs crimped to the candle wick are so tiny its not even funny.  They are smaller then a a dime.  The metal tabs in any tea light sold retail is larger.  No joke. I also believe the thickness of the wicks are thinner than advertised.  Too later to return.  Buyer beware.,2
B097D7S6KB,"This was my first time candle making and these worked perfectly! I was just melting down miscellaneous votives, pillars and almost finished jar candles and making new ones and I had no problems at all with this product. The only issue I had which I figured out right away was user error. The wicks on the first three wick candle I made went limp when I poured the wax but that was because I poured the hot wax on the wicks. That in turn melted the wax on the wicks so they didn't stand up straight. After that I took care not to pour hot wax down the wicks and they were fine. I can't wait to make more candles with this product!",5
B097D7S6KB,Arrived fast and with everything needed.,4
B097D7S6KB,"I had a bunch of random clumps of wax and partially used candles whose wicks were burnt completely out, and I was able to repurpose all of that into new, usable candles with this kit. It's amazing. I especially love the little sticky dots that come with it to hold the wick in place for you.Best feature - Easy to use for anyone",5
B097D7S6KB,"I bought these wicks to fix some scented candles I had which were cheaply made with only 1 wick when they needed 3. Putting the candles in boiling water melted the wax, leveling everything out, and I was able to insert 3 of these new wicks to the bottom and get a nearly unusable large blueberry candle back to 50"" life. So much better than tossing a candle entirely.",5
B097D7S6KB,"I'm not a candle maker, just a consumer that doesn't waste my money tossing out the leftover wax. I follow the instructions with the slight alterations of digging a hole through the wax and plant the wick in the hole. These burn slowly and work like a charm!",5
B097D7S6KB,"Muy conveniente porque trae todo Para hacer velas,",5
B097D7S6KB,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was surprised that you get so much for such a low price! I haven't used the wicks just yet but I love that there are 3 different sized wicks, glue dots,the blue thing to center the wicks, and also a clamp to keep it in place! Also comes with instructions on how to make a candle. So I def recommend.",4
B097D7S6KB,"a great occupyer, and also great learning tool for the kids and i too help teach and they make candles and sell in flemarkets.",5
B097D7S6KB,Simple to use and works well. No problems with this product and priced right. The wick burns great nd no smell,5
B097D7S6KB,It works fine if you make a tiny candle jar. I made about 3 inch diameter jar candles and it did not burn the wax on the entire perimeter. It could have been the type of wax issue but I did not find any issue before with other wicks for the same wax.,3
B097D7S6KB,"I love to recycle and reuse, so since I had a box of half used church pew candles in my basement, felt it was time to rebuild my candle supply after we lost power for what felt like 50 years...lol.  I have a bunch of glass jars I saved, so used those to replenish.  They worked great! Good value.",4
B097D7S6KB,"I do not make my own candles but have some custom made candles where the original wicks burn down faster than the wax (not exactly wax, but cannot recall what the specific material is).  When the candle has been burning, I can slide one of these in to replace an existing wick when it gets too low (the candle I have has 8 wicks in a long bowl).",5
B097D7S6KB,gfhgffh,5
B097D7S6KB,I got these candle wicks to make candles. They are the perfect size for my jars. It comes with everything you need to make the wick stand straight up. I will get more when I run out. Great product.,5
B097D7S6KB,Has been essential in making my first candles. These wicks have performed fine in a three wick container and in figural candles. I haven't used the stickers yet so can't comment on those. The holders are great tools that you will need. I've used the placer to stick into wax and it's an essential for containers.,5
B097D7S6KB,Amazing product.,5
B097D7S6KB,The kit is perfect for a beginner wanting to make their own candles like myself as a little hobby.,5
B097D7S6KB,"When I started trying to make soy candles, I sourced all my materials independently (string, metal piece, adhesive) and it cost much more and my adhesive didn't work (I used a paste before).I don't use the tools because I make big batches, but for making one candle at a time it's nice.Things are so much smoother having it all ready and there's so many, I still haven't run out.10/10",5
B097D7S6KB,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Simple and easy to use.,4
B097D7S6KB,"Many of my candles had melting awkwardly so I had to melt them in the over and replace their wicks. This set up came me everything I needed, containing multiples lengths of wicks that are easy to trim. There are tools that help you center your wicks and keep them straight. I have yet to have a candle get the ball shape at the end of these wicks!",5
B097D7S6KB,These wicks burn slowly and clean. I used them for my first attempt at candle making a this little kit made it a breeze.,5
B097D7S6KB,Wicks are.extra long,5
B097D7S6KB,"Melted all of the left over candle wax and tapers that were cracked,added some wax melts for scent,grabbed a few thrift store attractive bowls and made some great gifts! Fun winter project, includes everything you need!",5
B097D7S6KB,I bought these cuz I constantly have candles burning usually all the same scent. It is nice to be able to melt down that last 3/4 of an inch to half an inch that you never burn put it in one candle and reburn the candle.,4
B097D7S6KB,"I like the value of purchase, I like the wick if it was only being used for myself. But if you purchase these for a business, when you first light the wick it makes a pop like a firecracker. That is why I given this product a 4 star.",4
B097D7S6KB,"These are very sturdy wicks that burn with a big flame.  For my needs, I think the thinner wicks would have sufficed, but being a novice at this, lesson learned.  I bought these to make candles in jars out of the remains of many pillar candles I have burned and they worked great.  They stick well to the bottom of the jars.",4
B097D7S6KB,"Came as advertised, easy to use.",5
B097D7S6KB,"Everything I needed to complete the project I wanted...  I didn't want to spend a lot as my expensive candle's container was broken and I just wanted to melt the fragrant wax into a different container.  I used a clean disposable metal pie plate to melt the wax, followed the instructions included in this kit and I'm delighted!  I used a container of my choice, as this kit includes only various lengths of wick, adhesive for the wicks, wick stabilizers and cute gift labels. Great value!!",5
B097D7S6KB,easy to use and remake old candle leftovers into a new candle.,5
B097D7S6KB,"I wasted so much money not recycling old candles. I'm glad I bumped into this. Very easy to use just be aware when melting wax to make sure glass is room temp. Otherwise, any defects in the glass will make it crack open.Anyway, the extra gadgets put into package I am very happy about.  Very easy to use tools.",5
B097D7S6KB,"Our family loves making candles right now, these wicks were perfect and so easy to use!",5
B097D7S6KB,"These are amazing!!! I got the wick kit to combine a bunch of old candles into new ones. I'm sitting beside one of the lit Frankenstein candles now and it's burning perfectly. The wick stickers are wonderful and the tools are incredibly useful. I'm so beyond happy with this purchase. As a candle junkie, I'm always looking for ways to extend the life of wax. This kit made it incredibly easy to melt down and re-wick all the sugar cookie/pumpkin candles I burned through during fall and Christmas.This kit would be perfect to keep around for those moments when your favorite jar candle tunnels. This kit would also make a fun purchase/gift for anyone interested in candle making.",5
B097D7S6KB,This kit makes candle making so much easier!,5
B097D7S6KB,I am recycling our old burnt out candles and these are essential to making new ones! It gives you every tool you need but I found chopsticks work the best to hold the wick in place. The wicks are tall for larger candles and burn fast.,5
B097D7S6KB,"I got tired of the tunneling with some candles and the wax flooding the wick. So, I started ""remaking"" them with a new wick. This has all you need.",5
B097D7S6KB,I was satisfied with my candle making kit. I made my wick candles.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,They. Are a. Nice size  and good to have for putting on the back of pictures so you can hang them up I highly recommend them  they come with screws or you could hot glue them they are very sturdy hooks and not pricey at all,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Perfect hangers..... good quality, easy to attach",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Great quality, affordable, and great quantity. Hung up about 20 picture frames with them way cheaper than anywhere else.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Is very usefully,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I was trying to use a different piece of hardware to hang wall crosses I've been making and it was a disaster.  These things come with little screws instead of tiny nails, so right away it's much easier to install.  And because it's adjustable, it's not hard to get things to sit level.  Will definitely buy more!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,They are between small and medium. The screws are small. Had a hard time holding onto the screws will trying to screw them into the picture frames. Probably easier to put the holes in frame first so the screws will easily go in. Other than that they served the purpose. You get alot of screws and hinges. I recommend this product and seller.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"GOOD QUALITY, GREAT PRICE",5
B07L2NSJ2B,They worked out fine,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Work well,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Just what we needed. However the overnight delivery was a problem as we had to wait longer for the delivery,4
B07L2NSJ2B,The only thing I dislike is I assumed that they was a little longer. Probably my fault.  Other then that I'd buy em agin for sure.,4
B07L2NSJ2B,"Very small, but happy with my purchase.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Bought these for mounting European skull plaques, they work great and have a nice bag to keep them in. Really happy for how cheap they are",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Needed 3, got 27 spares. Installation was easy, I pre-drilled my frames with a small drill bit first and had no problems with the screws stripping.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Okay good,4
B07L2NSJ2B,Used this on a few pieces if art (they are heavy) and they worked very well. Few months later I have no worries.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Lots of hangers for the money.  Good value,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Sturdy and stable,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Sturdy, easy to install and cost effective",5
B07L2NSJ2B,They do what they claim to do,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"A great price, all black and comes complete with screws. If you buy frames you plan to wall mount, get these!!!  MOST wall mount frames that are heavier will snap over time bc of the small triangle wall mount installed on most frames. You can use an awl, start two small holes and just drill these into the back of the frame. Takes a minute but will las a LIFETIME on your wall! They will not come off of the back of the frame if installed properly!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,I will buy these again. I have purchased others in this same price point that were bad quality and had screws with no points. These are a winner with all pieces being functional,5
B07L2NSJ2B,They are a good medium size. Durable enough.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"These are strong and do the job but I found them hard to hold and get the tiny nails set in. I had to use a tiny pliers and try to happner them into a 6x6"" wood panel. I prefer the ones that are similar but have a build in 'nail' on each end; you just tap them in.  I should have looked more closely.",3
B07L2NSJ2B,Works with wood crafts,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Hangers are well made and include screws which a much easier to install than the usual brads. Also a fraction of the cost at the big box stores.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Just what I needed,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I have a crafting business and I make A LOT of wood decor and things you can hang. I always include these in a little business card kit, so my customers have the OPTION to hang their peice if they want to. Otherwise, many of my prices end up on decorate easel. I don't want to put holes on a peice of art, unless my customer tells me too. So this is a GREAT option to provide my customers.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Good quality.  Size as advertised.Thank you, to Everyone.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I occasionally hand make gifts for family (usually some sort of custom wood frame or decorative art), and instead of giving someone a desk piece, I wanted picture frame hangers so I could offer my pieces as wall art. These work as well as other hooks I've seen on store bought frames, and install with a couple pre-drilled holes. You'll still need some sort of hook or screw/nail in your wall to mount. Overall, they have worked well for the half dozen pieces I've used these on to date.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Arrived very quickly,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Perfect for my projects.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Need to hang up some wooden framed canvas pictures that are slightly heavy. I usually use the velcro sticky tape but it always rips the paint off the wall. Now I can easily hang up my pictures and move them whenever I want without issues.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I ordered a lot of canvas prints that had sticky tape for mounting on the back... That worked well, until it didn't They've been falling down all over my house, so I found these and now just screw one onto the back and it holds perfectly on the wood frame and with a little finish nail. Cheap and effective! Comes with screws and easy to install with a screwdriver! Would recommend!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,A good buy if you have a lot of frames to do. Far better than buying the little packs at art stores. We had 20 to do and always have more throughout the year. Mounting tacks for them might be a bit easier if you don't have a power screw driver. I have two different battery powered drivers though. Even at that the screws want to get away from you till they start as the tips aren't very sharp . I didn't take the time for drilling pilot holes though. Still all in all it makes for a really strong mount this way but that's why the 4 stars. I'm not complaining considering the quantity and price plus the durability factor. The wife likes that they are black.,4
B07L2NSJ2B,This container of picture hanging hardware is just what I was looking for and a quality product. I purchased the gold ones and they are attractive and sturdy.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Great product, only needed two and they sent tons,,,,Thanks!!!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"These were cheap, so keeping that in mind, I put one in a plaster item and it rusted during drying time!",3
B07L2NSJ2B,works really well,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Very strong, screws are perfect fit for the bracket.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,These are tiny but good for small projects,4
B07L2NSJ2B,"This item arrived in just 2 days after ordering. I like these because they are held in with screws, unlike most of them that you have to nail in.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Great replacement hooks for hanging frames - easy and quick to use.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"We had bought several picture frames that came with hanging apparatuses, but they sucked. This was a cheap and easy fix to make hanging them much easier. I like them to line up when hanging pictures and even use a laser level to make everything even, so being able to put the hanging spot where I wanted it made it even easier for me. Great purchase.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I loathe hanging frames on the wall!  I mean, they all come with different hanging mechanisms whether it be a loop, or a triangle, or a wire, or what have you... they all tend to be a pain in the a$$.  We were repurposing some frames (whitewashing them and wanted to hang them from a different edge than intended), so I bought these little do-dads.  We ended up hanging a bunch of frames, so we used a lot of these.  They are really simple and nice!  I pre-drilled holes for the screws (just held the metal hanger as the guide and drilled right through each hole), and that made install a breeze!  The screws are plenty strong when using a pre-drilled pilot hole.  They're are totally sturdy once attached.  I like them.  Small, simple, and strong.  Just what I was looking for.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Works well for small, lightweight projects.",4
B07L2NSJ2B,This make life way easier,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I had been looking in stores for sawtooth hangars with screws and they are just not anywhere to be found.So, when I found these on Amazon, it was a no brainer.  The value was great and now I have plenty on hand for all the things I want to hang.  I am a happy camper!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Work as they should,5
B07L2NSJ2B,I like the price,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Need to hang relatively light stuff on the wall?  These are perfect. Enough for you and your descendants.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,great quality. great price.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I'm so happy I got these, I'm set for a LONG time! So many for such a good price! I highly recommend this if you're a crafter!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Had a few older picture frames that needed new hardware to hang and these did the trick.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I use it to fix my picture frame on the wall, the old screw is too short, but this product has longer screw.It fixed frame and the picture is on the wall now.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,These are easy to install and do the job,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I had a heavy 8""x10"" frame that was designed to sit on a table, but I wanted to hang it on the wall.  The screws are much sturdier than nails.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Perfect hooks with plenty of screws . Was able to hang all my artwork just fine,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Really like,5
B07L2NSJ2B,These were great for my wooden plaques.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,These worked great for hanging all my cribbage boards and wooden decorations.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"These hangers are great, built very well, sturdy and the screws are surely a plus, no nails, thank you!!!  Recommend very highly. Thank you. HK",5
B07L2NSJ2B,This was what I was looking for,5
B07L2NSJ2B,My husband recently bought a beautiful picture that did not come with hanging hardware already on it.Cue Amazon!I ordered these picture hangers right away. I was able to install them into the frame of the picture without any damage to the picture. I used the instructions to hang them on my wall and voila! The picture has stayed in place for a few months now.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,The screws are a bit bigger.,4
B07L2NSJ2B,"I have a large art project using numerous different sized and styled frames. To make mounting easier, I removed the existing hardware and replaced with these brackets. Easy to install and sturdy!",5
B07L2NSJ2B,Exactly what I expected.  No faults.To avoid splitting the frame material I predrilled as these frames happened to be plastic but probably you could drive the screws straight into soft wood.  I found no manufacturing defects in the 30 or so hangers and screw sets I used.  Hey still have 20 sets left.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Would recommend,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"This is not for to heavy of frames or paintings. I put up 20by30 canvas art, light weight. It looks good thank you seller.",4
B07L2NSJ2B,"These are the best for the precision alignment of multi-frame arrangements.As advertised and pictured. I hold the attaching brad in position with needle nose pliers, then tack.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,I like this product I was hoping it was a bit larger though,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Great,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Cost effective metal picture hangersFriendly prompt serviceHigh quality good. Value hangersI do a lot of framing and hanging these are. GreatCan be hard to find around hereAmazon is my easy vendor and saves gas and time thanks anazon,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Takes some practice getting it installed exactly right but otherwise great product, great price!",4
B07L2NSJ2B,These were easy to screw in to the wall hangings I was making. Just be sure to size your nails for hanging accordingly as the teeth on the back were quite small!,5
B07L2NSJ2B,worked like they should. happy with product,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Although this specific size won't work for what I had planned I will be ordering a smaller size! Great Product!,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Very sturdy easy to install hangers for picture frame,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"Good quality, just what I need.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,These are very good for putting on the back of your pictures to hang them up,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Worked well for my Christmas art projects for gifts.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,"I decided to put a small bracket on an oil painting. This claw part was okay but the screws ( not nails, should be nails) were so small it took me forever to get them into the wood and another forever to screw them in. This product should come with 1 inch nails not itsy bitsy impossible screws.",1
B07L2NSJ2B,"I personally, did not use the screws the product came with because my frames weren't all wooden, so instead I super glued them, and they worked just fine! Very nice and small, exactly what I needed for my smaller frames.",5
B07L2NSJ2B,I would go to Home Depot and purchase my hardware but they were out so I decided to try these. When adding screws make sure to drill slow because you will strip the head if you go fast. Hangs up perfectly on my wall.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,Use for diy frames. Easy install and hold well on wall.,5
B07L2NSJ2B,I have a few cheap frames without a good back clip to hang pictures.  This metal hangers are perfect.  I have a very small crafting drill with the exact bits to drill tiny holes into the frame making it easy to install these clips.  Also used a tiny screw driver!,5
B071HH42WW,"I use these with an old, 60w glue gun once used for flooring. I specifically use these for wrapping gifts in brown craft paper, and for this purpose the glue works very well. It has a decent working time, on account of its melting temperature, I'd say 15s, and is viscous enough to be easy to work with. You can use a heat gun or even a hot iron to smooth out the glue under the paper, if you want to ensure there are no bumps.I've used it to bind glass and wood, and there it works pretty well too, better than you would expect, though I wouldn't necessarily say it is a permanent bond in the case of glass.The value is good - one bag lasts me three years or so. Are these better than any other glue sticks? That I do not know. However, they do work perfectly well for their intended purpose, so I see no reason not to recommend them.",5
B071HH42WW,Hot glue that works. Holds great!,5
B071HH42WW,"I always buy these for my projects. They hold better than any I have tried. They are very durable , dry quickly and a great value for the money.  The adhesive quality is very strong. The only kind I use to hold my  rope on my scratching post for my cats.",5
B071HH42WW,"So, I saw this lady reviewing the Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks on YouTube, whew chile, she was just bashing the product. I bought for that reason ONLY. C'mon now its GLUE!!! depending on a project it may or may not work.Well, I can tell you I bought 3 bags of the 45 count, (yeah I really needed that many) I had a big project with various media pieces that consisted of wood, metal, paper, foam and felt. Ya'll, it worked flawlessly it bonded everything solidly rock hard. I had one media's piece alignment (yeah crooked as it could get) I had to get a flat head screw driver and a hammer to break loose the adhesion. I tested it with another glue stick brand on the same project but only making 4 items. The Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks are still adhered. The other brand, well I don't know what you call it, but the temperature in my arts and craft room would fluctuate with furnace temp set to 60 and natural air outside (this has not been a normal 2020 season of temps outside with cold days and snow in April for example) when the temp dropped the heat would turn on. I found the non Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks adhesion no longer bonded to the media pieces. I say all this to say, check the packaging for the workable temperatures for your project medias allowing for the -/+ margin of error as to its adhesion hold. It was odd I would think ALL hot glues would do the same thing that's not the case so check with the vendor of the product.Well I just applied the Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks over the other brand and as of this review the adhesion is still bonded to the project media. So, overall I like Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks and have stocked up on it (right here can I make that scratched needle to record sound, ha haaaa I used up but 1/2 bag of my stock pile. Dog-gonit!!! Just went and check yeah 1/2 of bag left; AMAZON here I come another for another order of Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks because it works for me.Oh and I forgot to mention I have tested with and am using the following glue guns in the following order: #1 Ad-TechPro 200 corded; #2 Lowes: Arrow single temp cordless, #3 Arrow single temp corded; #? Surebonder cordless (sorry trying to figure this one out the ""2 minute glue time off the charging cradle"" not really liking that nor the leaking while on its base (they said it didn't do this), the squeeze trigger while using, fatigued my hand, I was literally squeezing it  so hard to make hot glue come out my hand was shaking ya'll know that was too much, what in the world is that about. I can barely press the trigger on my Arrow cordless and the glue just flows  and I don't have to return it to the charger in 2 minutes I get a good leisurely 30 minutes. So, I think with Surebonder it has to be the ""user"" <------ME I have to practice with it more because that first experience was from it coming right out of it's packaging  (last night 5/24/20) letting it per its instructions heat up for 5 minutes.I'm telling ya'll it felt like I was gonna snap that little trigger part right off that is how hard I was trying make it dispense the hot glue. Again, my Arrow, works great allowing 30 minute use time, I just wished like my others and the Surebonder that it came with that.43 bigger glue stick barrel. It only came with the small one and it gets so hot that I find myself going through the mini sticks like water. (note to self ---->> if that Surebonder don't work I will invest in more mini Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks for my Arrow that worked flawlessly<<). Ok, that's it for this review, I hope the information is helpful. Thanks for reading.",5
B071HH42WW,Not sure these are better than other glue sticks but they came on time and get the job done.,4
B071HH42WW,Easy to work with.  Good adhesion.  Use with my crafts.  Delivered as expected.  Will order again.,5
B071HH42WW,I make wreaths and floral arrangements.  This is the only hot glue I will use.  It will hold all in place even in the heat of the summer.,5
B071HH42WW,Always my go to brand for any adhesive.,5
B071HH42WW,Love,5
B071HH42WW,"So what more can ya say, it works",5
B071HH42WW,I love these they were great. I use them all the time.,5
B071HH42WW,Good buy,5
B071HH42WW,"I use these for all of my home and classroom projects.  They have a great hold with a small amount of glue. I have tried many brands but these are the best. I use them with the Gorilla glue gun, but I'm sure you can use them with any glue gun that's the correct size. One bag of these last me a whole school year. One of my must haves as a teacher.",5
B071HH42WW,Like gorilla glue. I have a mini gorilla glue hot glue gun. Good amount for the pricing.,5
B071HH42WW,Gorilla glue makes excellent products and these glue sticks are great.,5
B071HH42WW,"I'm a major crafter and seller. This is now the only glue I'll use. You can thrown one of my crafts across the room an nothing glued down will give way. It does dry within a min. And it's not stringy. A touch is all you need. I used it on ornaments,  faux foliage, satin ribbon, foam wreaths....the best.",5
B071HH42WW,"Descent price for what you get. FYI, look at the chart. Each type of glue is desighned for specific temps & moisture regions. Figure out wich one fits your climate conditions best.",5
B071HH42WW,Works great for our glue gun!,5
B071HH42WW,They are what they are,4
B071HH42WW,These are as advertised.,5
B071HH42WW,Work well,5
B071HH42WW,"This is what I purchase constantly. Love the adhesiveness. They melt well, I think they're a good brand",5
B071HH42WW,Please correct your description. The 1st part says 45 quantity then Below it says 1 pack of 20. I was not certain how many I was getting. 45 is the extended working time. Not quantity. Please correct for future buyers.,4
B071HH42WW,Good stuffworks well beyond what I expectedA rating,5
B071HH42WW,"My old glue sticks were getting jammed in my new glue gun.  It called for 1/2"" sticks but they didn't work.  These are 4.7"" and work perfectly.  I'm so happy that I found the right brand and size.  Great buy!!",5
B071HH42WW,"These are full-sized glue sticks, not the mini ones. I mostly use hot glue for small crafts or in combination with wood glue if its a small joint or in a weird place where I can't fit a clamp; the hot glue keeps it in place while the wood glue cures for the long run. Great stuff!",5
B071HH42WW,used these for a Halloween decoration craft and worked great. Strong hold and quick melting.,5
B071HH42WW,First time reupholstering anything and was nervous to say the least. But this fabric was easy to cut using my newly bought K20 German sheers. I used the old fabric as a template and the added about an inch all the way around so I could fold it under before stabling. I removed about 500 ancient square tacks from this and replacd the webbing too. Removed the hair and straw filler and added 2in foam which was a little too thick but I was able to pull it tight and stabled it. While it's not 100% perfect it looks good at 5 feet and I think only I see my few mistakes. Highly recommend as I did end up buying 2 addition yards after my initial 1yd. I used a 1in wide gimp because I thought for sure I'd have more oops moment that I'd need to hide but I didn't.tl The gimp was glued down initial with a fabric glue that was basically worthless. So I bought this Gorilla Hot Glue and it was FANTASTIC!!!!! It had 4 layers on it including a pink velvet top layer not shown. I decided to keep the memory of these past fabrics and but a piece of the pink into of the rainbow flower patter before adding my foam. The back has this new matching upholstery now and the bottom was done in a very sheer white that's hidden.,5
B071HH42WW,Good price and shipped fast and holds good,5
B071HH42WW,"As an avid DIYer and crafter, I've tried my fair share of glue sticks over the years. The Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks, Full Size, have quickly become my go-to choice, and here's why.Firstly, the 4"" length is perfect for both small and larger projects. I find that I'm not constantly reloading my glue gun, which is a huge time-saver. The .43"" diameter fits seamlessly into my full-size glue gun, ensuring a smooth and consistent flow of glue every time.But what truly sets these glue sticks apart is their adhesive strength. When they say ""Gorilla"" strength, they mean it! Whether I'm bonding wood, fabric, plastic, or a mix of materials, the bond is robust and long-lasting. No more worrying about my creations falling apart or needing touch-ups.Additionally, the drying time is impressive. The glue sets quickly, allowing me to move on to the next step of my project without long waits. Yet, it provides just enough open time for adjustments, ensuring perfect placement.In conclusion, if you're looking for reliable, strong, and efficient glue sticks for your crafting and DIY needs, the Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks, Full Size, are a top-tier choice. They've elevated the quality of my projects and have made the crafting process so much smoother. Highly recommended!",5
B071HH42WW,Super hold,5
B071HH42WW,These glue sticks are perfect.,5
B071HH42WW,Excellent adhesion.,5
B071HH42WW,As advertised.,5
B071HH42WW,Always a good quality product,5
B071HH42WW,"Great adhesiveness, dries quick, good value",5
B071HH42WW,I HAVE OTHER GORILLA PRODUCTS ALWAYS GOOD QUALITY,5
B071HH42WW,Perfect,4
B071HH42WW,Works great for the bigger hot glue guns. Also once cold sticks really well . Also cheaper buying here than in stores. I alway come back for more,5
B071HH42WW,"Good quality glue sticks no running or dripping, great price and value for the money!!",5
B071HH42WW,"This glue sticks are good, they do the job but I guess I was expecting too much.  I glued a piece of tile, it lasted 4 weeks then it came off again but perfect for everything else",4
B071HH42WW,I use this for all of my craft projects as well as anything else that needs glue.  It forms a strong bond that does not come loose easily.,5
B071HH42WW,Nothing bad to say about these.  Maybe they could be cheaper.  This was my 4th pack from them so I guess I like them! :-),4
B071HH42WW,Holds on tight.,4
B071HH42WW,This is some of the best hot glue I have used. It is tacky when applied and cools to a good level of adhesion. Everything a hot glue should be.,5
B071HH42WW,"Never used this brand before, will never use any other brand, uses a little more but the adhesiveness is worth the price",4
B071HH42WW,"I do not plan to go back to another glue stick after using these.So please keep these around, none of us want to use them old crappy sticks!",5
B071HH42WW,Best glue out there!! Great price,5
B071HH42WW,Very satisfied,5
B071HH42WW,"So I ordered this because it is gorilla. Glue in the regular glue sticks and holes well. 2 issues I have with this glue. It dries cloudy white, not clear and it also wants the glue has cold. It's easily applied off. It does not hold.",2
B071HH42WW,Good,5
B071HH42WW,"I like Gorilla Super Glue and decided to try these glue sticks.  I am SUPER happy that I did.  I use hot glue on MANY crafts, and this is the best I have ever used.  It really holds well and, not sure why, but does not seem to drip as easily as many others that I have tried.  I would definitely recommend this, and I will be buying more.",5
B071HH42WW,great so far,5
B071HH42WW,"Okay the only good thing about these Gorilla glue sticks is the hold is good and strong. The good abruptly ends completely right there.These dried white for me and strung up a lot. I got burned a few times. I've tried some of the more affordable gluesticks and one did string a little but I never got burned and those produced only very fine strings which easily rubbed off. These Gorilla glue sticks produced thick strings so did me some serious damage. I even bought a new glue gun, thinking that might have been the problem. It wasn't.Arrow brand has remained most superior in performance of glue sticks for me though I would prefer they were more affordable, though these Gorillas were not.I tried them based on reviews. This makes me feel like an idiot because I have already been dismayed in buying their black tape, crazy glue and wood glue. I wouldn't buy anything Gorilla again. I really don't understand how their products get such good press and markets like Home Depot.  I guess the higher prices they charge goes into branding/marketing?Buy these only if you plan to wear burn proof gloves, don't mind the waste and mess of a fair portion stringing up between glue spots and don't care it's opaque and it makes you feel cool to spend more money on a well marketed brand.Otherwise, learn from my foolish mistake and pass these over.",3
B071HH42WW,holds well,5
B071HH42WW,Works with any hot glue gun,5
B071HH42WW,These are great quality glue sticks.  I use them in my Ryobi battery powered glue gun and they work great.,5
B071HH42WW,The glue works very well in multiple arts/crafts settings. The adhesion is very strong and your projects will stick together!,5
B071HH42WW,"Love these glue sticks, it serves multiple purposes and delivered right on time",5
B071HH42WW,"I shoved these in my glue gun and they melted and came out the spout. The stuff I smeared it on is still stuck where I put it. Don't know if it will fall off in the future. I doubt it, since they have a brand they need to protect.It's 4 start cause I does what I expect 5 stars is for something that goes above and beyond. Under 4 is for stuff that does not do what I expected. Even lower is stuff that does not do something they say it does.",4
B071HH42WW,"These glue sticks hold better that standard glue sticks, but I still with their were options for even stronger glue sticks. I love the longer sticks so that I don't have to add additional one's as often or remember to grab one for a project.",5
B071HH42WW,Works well just wish they were longer.,5
B071HH42WW,It is very good and will stay the course.  I live in Southwest Florida with the front door directly facing the sun until about 2 pm.  The Custom Wreaths I design will hold up to the heat stress without a problem while other Hot melt glue will start coming apart. This stuff is great!,5
B071HH42WW,I use these glue sticks in my glue gun for everything including repairing sandals and shoes,5
B071HH42WW,"I think the Gorilla brand glue sticks have superior adhesion than some other brands.  I use them for crafting, especially floral arrangements.  I haven't used any other brand since I tried Gorilla glue.  Good value.",5
B071HH42WW,"These glue sticks are very good. They fit my gun perfectly, melt evenly and hold up very well my various projects. From holding boards together to filling in gaps in broken plastic parts and items. As the name says Gorilla glue. It gets the job done.",5
B071HH42WW,This stuff really works.  You have to work fast though because it has a 15 second window before the strong grip kicks in.  I didn't expect it to be as strong as it is.,5
B071HH42WW,I like these long glue sticks. They are easy to use for crafts and other products around the house,5
B071HH42WW,I purchased this to glue some sisal rope to a cat tree was very easy to work with melts very quickly very sturdy cats have gone ham on the tree and it has held very well.,5
B071HH42WW,"How do you rate a hot glue gun stick? Well, it is a decent sized stick but I goes through the gun kind of fast. I will say that the glue provides some good adhesion, but what would you expect from Gorilla. This sticks are longer than the standard ones so, I can only imagine how short the others last. I have used no other glue sticks in my gun since I bought it and I will probably continue to do so.",4
B071HH42WW,Excited to use this glue with the glue gun I just bought,5
B071HH42WW,"Us these in my new cordless glue gun, they work great!",5
B071HH42WW,Liked it,5
B071HH42WW,so good,5
B071HH42WW,"I buy these regularly for my gorilla glue gun. They work great, easy to use - no complaints.",5
B071HH42WW,"this hot glue had a super strong bond.  easy to use.  I use it on high heat, but low works too",5
B071HH42WW,works well,5
B071HH42WW,"Works great for crafting, will buy more in the future.",5
B071HH42WW,Perfect,5
B071HH42WW,"I used this to glue sisal around a PVC pipe to make a cat climbing post. I used the Gorilla hot glue gun on high setting. The rope is stuck well. Cat activity has not been able to loosen the rope. One tip, wear old clothes and gloves when you use it. The glue is very very hot (not like my craft glue gun) burned myseld several times and the glue will not come out of your clothes (or gloves).",5
B071HH42WW,Good glue.,5
B071HH42WW,I used a hot glue gun to make wreaths in other projects.Everything I've bought from Amazon is terrific.Thank you very much.,5
B071HH42WW,Used on several different projects and always work perfectly!,5
B071HH42WW,Good quality,5
B071HH42WW,if your using the hot glue gun nothing tops these,5
B071HH42WW,"Gorilla Glue is known for its strength and quality. The glue sticks are no different. We also use the Gorilla large glue guns too. We use the glue sticks for many uses  but mainly for cabinetmaking. They work great on wood, plastic and metal with no problems.",5
B071HH42WW,"Dog toys and accessories are expensive! That's why when one breaks, I repair it instead of buying another one. Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks get the job done. These are much better than the ones I used to use. They are stronger. These are a must-have for your DIY projects!When gluing, I recommend smoothing the edges with the glue gun. That way, it will be harder for the blob of glue to peel off.",4
B071HH42WW,I only buy Gorilla Glue Sticks.  The adhesive sticks so well. I don't have to go back to the item and glue it again. I appreciate the price and how many I get in the bag.,5
B071HH42WW,"I have been putting these Hot Glue Sticks to the test for the past several weeks!I took rough cut lumber and constructed winter bird roosts as well as BlueBird Boxes exclusively with Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks and no nails, no screws, no hardware.I used a high-temp hot glue gun also purchased on Amazon - I tried the Chandler gun and it could not keep up without me having to wait for it to heat more glue - Upgraded to a 300watt Pro Grade Hot Glue Gun and it makes ALL the difference - hotter application, no waiting, stronger bond!I put the bird houses and winter roosts outside and mounted them.They have endured 60 mph wind gusts, severe rain and sleet, as well as - 16 degree weather (not counting the wind chill) -I was going to wait until spring to post this review, but based on how this glue has performed, I'm confident in giving Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks a FIVE STAR RATING and would not hesitate to recommend it to everyone!!!STRONG BOND IN ALL WEATHER",5
B071HH42WW,This was a good purchase!,5
B0751VFF2X,"These are a lot better than the sticky ones you get from a fair or store. I've used a lot of different brands and after a few months, the adhesive would peel off, and my poster would fall. These don't seem to have that problem but I'll update in a year.",5
B0751VFF2X,These strips are great. They have held up a large wall banner and a tapestry without fail. They are easy to use and removal is a breeze.,5
B0751VFF2X,"I bought these to hang up posters and wooden boards, and it works very well. My items haven't fallen since I've put them up. They are very durable and are also easy to peel off if you need to readjust. Highly recommend!",5
B0751VFF2X,"They do what they're supposed to do well. Product came undamaged and the ones I put up on my walls months ago have not sagged or fallen off. I have yet to try and remove one but I haven't had an issues yet. Good price for the amount too, I reccomend buying larger packs than the smaller ones since these are way cheaper per each.",5
B0751VFF2X,"they work well and don't mar the wallsdownsides:-  they will eventually no longer stick and in hot rooms they will fail earlier. i have some that have lasted 10-14 yrs (and are still going) but others that have popped in 3-4 yrs (hot rooms)- do not use them on posters or art u care about! they can remove some of the paper stock. not always, but happens frquently",4
B0751VFF2X,Absolutely love command strips no holes in the walls. Easy to remove with out having ruined walls,5
B0751VFF2X,I love being able to hang things where I want them! Christmas tends to explode at my house and these definitely help me make that happen!,5
B0751VFF2X,Worked for me.,5
B0751VFF2X,I used on a cruise to hold magnets to the cabin cruise stateroom and these held for as week.  Still had staying power when I removed.  I will use Command Strips again.,5
B0751VFF2X,Perfect for hanging holiday decor with no damage to walls or ceiling,4
B0751VFF2X,As described,5
B0751VFF2X,My wife put together 2 beautiful wooden puzzles and glued the pieces of each puzzle together then used these strips to hang them on our wall. One needed a couple of extra strips because it was warped a tad. No problem just peeled the tabs from the front and back of a couple strips and carefully slipped them under the edged of the problem piece. Repair is invisible.  No frame for the puzzles necessary. They sit flush against the wall.,5
B0751VFF2X,I use these to hang our Christmas stockings up by the fireplace.  They hold great and the stockings get heavy!,5
B0751VFF2X,Does the job well and easy to remove.,5
B0751VFF2X,"it holds everything well and its easy to use. its so durable too like, nothing ive put up has fallen even when ive had my window open with air blasting through, highly recommend",5
B0751VFF2X,I use these annually to hang is pictures and signs on the fair horse stalls at the county fair every year. They are a great solution to use instead of staples or nails - when you are hanging something temporarily. I am sure they work well for permanent use as well. I am just glad they exist.,5
B0751VFF2X,Fair price and fast shipping,5
B0751VFF2X,They always work fantastic!,5
B0751VFF2X,"Used in a large scientific poster event on 'fragile' walls (renovated, repainted, white).  NO DAMAGE was incurred upon removal even after 4 weeks of use!!  Will definitely order from Amazon again for the terrific PRICE BREAK for bulk.",5
B0751VFF2X,Great,5
B0751VFF2X,These things are terrific. They stick very strongly but release when you want to take them down. I used these to hold LED wall tiles in my kids room and they can bear the weight without issue.,5
B0751VFF2X,"It's a command strip, you can't really go wrong with it. I've tried off brand, but they don't hold as well as the trade and true!",5
B0751VFF2X,"I post a lot of things on my walls of my home office and go thru a ton of these.  They work really well at holding things up and hopefully one day when I need to take something down, they won't pull the paint from the walls.",5
B0751VFF2X,"This was a good solution to my daughter scotch taping concert posters to her wall and ripping all the paint off.  Works well, good value, pretty confident they'll come off clean.",5
B0751VFF2X,"It hangs stuff up super well, but they all ripped holes in my drywall when I tried to take them off. Pretty easily fixed, but still super annoying",4
B0751VFF2X,These are perfect for holding up any items you have. I used them to hold up my bulletin board and it has not fallen off yet. Would definitely buy this again.,5
B0751VFF2X,Perfect solution for hanging posters to any surface with out damaging the walls.,5
B0751VFF2X,"The Command Poster Strips, Damage Free Hanging Poster Hangers are a God send when it comes to Holiday decorating. Apply & remove these strips with great ease. Am never without a supply of these in my home.",5
B0751VFF2X,These always stick and peel off as I expect them to.  Never a surprise.,5
B0751VFF2X,Love command of all sorts. These are perfect for posters and even light weight items and hooks. Command strips never mark up the walls or create messes or stick.,5
B0751VFF2X,"The product is easy to use and it didn't cause any hassle when removing it.However, it's also important to note that a few of the hangers fell off under the weight of a Christmas garland. While eight out of ten hangers stayed in place, the adhesion could be stronger, and customers should be mindful of the surface they are placing the strips on. It may not be the best option for brick surfaces, which are not even.Overall, Command Poster Strips are a good product, but they may not be suitable for all surfaces and weights. If you're using them for lighter objects such as posters or picture frames, they should work well. Still, for heavier objects, it's essential to be mindful of the weight and the surface you're applying them to.",4
B0751VFF2X,I put up posters in my classroom with these.  Low profile and easy to remove.,5
B0751VFF2X,Great for dorm use! Follow the directions to affix!,5
B0751VFF2X,"I love these 3M strips. I've used them many times for many different applications. We bought them once in my parent organization to tack up posters to painted cinder bricks for a week during the book fair. They worked very well. I did wash the wall as they recommend, or it's likely the wouldn't have held because that school wall was very dirty. I had no trouble removing them without peeling paint for that application. This time I used them at home to construct a marble run on the painted drywall. I was successful in removing all but one of the tabs without peeling paint, but they are so strong that when I had trouble getting behind the object I'd stuck to the wall (not enough room in between the object and my fingers) the piece with a chunk of wall came off with more than just paint. I've experienced this before even when being able to pull the tab down like they recommend for removal. However, the objects you stick to the wall are so stuck that if you can't easily pull the tab when wanting to remove the item you risk pulling the object away from your wall too far and ripping off a chunk. It would be great to add a small hole to the pull tab perhaps where you could hook a piece of wire or something to pull it down rather than trying to fit thick fingers behind something. Just a thought...",5
B0751VFF2X,"I use Command strips for everything. Love, love. love them.",5
B0751VFF2X,"It works, but mine was used already! It was opened with 4 out of 64 missing. Nice one Amazon...",4
B0751VFF2X,"I love these since I use the command hooks for everything and move pretty often. Have had no issues with paint coming off as long as I make sure to install it with the little tab down and pull straight down on it when removing. Great for hanging keys, hats, very lightweight wall decor like lights and plant vines.",5
B0751VFF2X,Don't buy the cheap ones. They don't work. These do.,5
B0751VFF2X,"I recently reordered these for my daughter. She brought a package up to college dorm needed another. She has cinder block walls so can't use tacks or nails, and these are better than most tape. They are easy to use, with multiple uses, and she loves the convenience of Command Strips!~ Kort",5
B0751VFF2X,Was able to hold up heavy furniture. Good buy,5
B0751VFF2X,Makes hanging posters super easy!,5
B0751VFF2X,I received size medium only. This is not the variety pack in the photo.,3
B0751VFF2X,I use these to hang everything and will always be my go to brand,5
B0751VFF2X,For college kid,5
B0751VFF2X,I have had trouble with my hung artwork becoming unlevel when my house vibrates with heavy trucks driving by.  Placing just two of these at the bottom corners of each frame secures the artwork to the wall - therefore eliminating the need to straighten on a daily basis.,5
B0751VFF2X,"I decorated a bedroom and placed 8.5x11 paper printouts of photos on the wall.  This was with normal thin paper, not heavier photo paper.  I first tried Command brand double sided mounting tape meant for posters and things, then I tried this product when those did not hold anything onto the wall.  I used a total of 2 Command Poster Adhesive strips at all 4 corners and 2 in the middle at both sides, top & bottom of each 8.5x11 piece of paper I placed on the wall.  I ate a meal and came to show the room off to someone only to find all papers on the floor and bare walls!  Both products should of held up to several pounds according to the boxes and company info.  My walls are smooth and clean as they were painted not more than a 5 days ago.  No dust or anything as the vents, windows, and doors were closed to the room since the paint dried until then.  Temperature in the room was 68 degrees so it was not too hot or cold for the adhesive to have issues.  Totall waste of money!  You should not use 16 poster strips on an 8.5x11 piece of paper and it still fall off a smooth, clean wall.",3
B0751VFF2X,Nice,4
B0751VFF2X,the strips are very strong and durable,5
B0751VFF2X,Command strips are just not as good as they used to be. I am about to give up on them.,2
B0751VFF2X,Worked as they were supposed to,5
B0751VFF2X,Holds stuff on wall. Pulled some paint off walls,4
B0751VFF2X,"I used this to hang posters in my classroom. Very few products will actually stick to the walls, but these work every time.",5
B0751VFF2X,"My life is on my walls and it shows. These little command strips let me go buck wild and experiment with more, more, more! I dream of new ways to surround myself with whatever is pleasing to my eye and creates a haven in my home. The strips let me hang a poster, a quilt, a coaster, a flag, a clipping, artwork, you name it. They remove cleanly for happy landlords!",5
B0751VFF2X,"Overall Command is a good product and I would recommend. My issue (and 2-star rating) mainly is with the supplier that sold the packs to me (Amazon was the shipper, but I don't know what company they got these from). I reuse the hooks every year for my Halloween parties and always order tons of replacement strips. I order multiple packs that were supposed to be 64 stripes each. Several bags only had half of what they promised, while the other packs had the correct amount. But when I tried to return the product Amazon needed the entire shipment back. I needed the full packs and used them. I feel a bit ripped off.If you are looking for a review on the strips themselves, they are very good. Better than some of the generic brands I have used. Command gets my two thumbs up.Pros: The replacement strips do work well. Depending on the surface, it does not always come off easily or cleanly. I have had a few times it took the paint or part of the wall off. The strips adhere fast and easy. You don't always have the wait a long time to place an item on your hook. If you use for paper posters, you will have little issue with it staying up.Cons: They do not come cleanly off 100% of the time. I have had no problem with some strips, but on the same surface wall, one will take a chunk of it off. I can't explain it. Sometimes the strip breaks with the hook still on the wall. It really is sticky! Once down it's down. I have had some hooks stay on my wall for years. I go through about 480 replacement strips every Halloween (hanging fabric, decor, lights, weighed decor and signage).I would buy again, but maybe from an actual store if I buy multiple packs, so I know that I am getting what i am paying for.",2
B0751VFF2X,"One of my entry sensors fell on the floor because the stickiness of the 3M double sided tape. It just wore out. Well, you can get these replacement units for free from the simply safe website, but it takes a really long time, and you only get a few to cover your need. Based on the cost alone, it is worth it to buy these replacement units from Amazon. So that you are ready to go at a moment's notice.",5
B0751VFF2X,Not what I was expecting very small strips,3
B0751VFF2X,"Easy access to materials I might be driving around all day to find. These Command products have all worked well for me. Having recently replaced and painted our walls, it's important that we not put holes back in while we decorate.",5
B0751VFF2X,Great for hanging pictures without damaging your walls. I'm a repeat buyer. I recommend it.,5
B0751VFF2X,Makes them easy to remove and place elsewhere; always have a few on hand.,5
B0751VFF2X,Their command strips? What can you say?,5
B0751VFF2X,I bought this to hang some small 8 x 10 frames and they have done their job. All the frames are still hanging on the wall and the prices are just right.,5
B0751VFF2X,"The only thing I dislike about these is when the tape tabs are on the wall a long time. The tape becomes brittle and snaps, and I've earned a few wallboard tears as a result. That's not very often, though, and I love being able to stick them up anywhere. The occasional consequences are well worth the flexibility and convenience.",4
B0751VFF2X,Great product use them all over the house.,5
B0751VFF2X,These work like a charm and you get a lot of them in the package which I like!,5
B0751VFF2X,The description said it was going to be a multi size pack. All I received were small strips.  Some of the strips were not sticky when you pulled of the backing.,2
B0751VFF2X,great value  performed beautifully,5
B0751VFF2X,Love it so much  Glen,5
B0751VFF2X,"When it came time to take down my pictures, they stripped the paint from the wall. Good if you want a permanent installation, bad if you have to move apartments like me.",3
B0751VFF2X,Good value to purchase if you need a lot to put up posters/photos or anything lightweight on the wall. Perfectly apartment-friendly and easy to remove.,5
B0751VFF2X,My wife is scared to death of sticking nails and tacks all over the walls so these things have been the answer.  They work well and are easy enough to use.,3
B0751VFF2X,"Love these things for hanging holiday deco in my apt. Keeps the walls undamaged and my apt deposit secure. Holds a fair bit of weight- loaded three fake-plant garlands and a string of lights on one hook, probably was a good 8 lbs, and not a wiggle. Comes off clean. Only downside is sometimes the tab snaps off when you're pulling on it to get the hook off the wall, but it hasn't effected the ability to get them off cleanly, with no residue or paint dmg.",5
B0751VFF2X,"6/26/2020 Update: so they worked really well but in the heavier posters start to come off and its a easy fix i just need to push the poster back and its good for another week or so before it starts to do the same thing. i finally just use a dab of super glue and it fixed my problem i would give it five stars if it wasn't for this issue.made the mistake not to buy some of these to put up my posters and stead tried duck tape on my newly painted wall and did not work at all. after that failed terribly bought these to give it a try, after trying flex tape that didn't work either, i finally gave in and when they came they worked perfectly and haven't came down unlike the other solutions i tried. save yourself the trouble unlike i did and buy these if you are looking to put up posters and such.",3
B0751VFF2X,"This command strips always work very well, just follow the instructions.",5
B0751VFF2X,After hanging several frames all the same size two fell. Also when removing a few older ones it took the paint off the wall.,4
B0751VFF2X,I used to put up posters had a little slip and one of them unstuck i followed directions like the package said (obviously be careful if you use them on posters like me) and removed and used a new one a little pice of the poster back removed but i wasn't gentle and i cant even see it from the front so im not mad other than that no problems works great,5
B0751VFF2X,I bought these to hang a variety of small things around the house. You really can't go wrong with these as long as you prepare the surface the way they tell you to. I used the 99% isopropyl alcohol to clean the surfaces. Worked incredibly well. I ended up taking my neighbors apartment building sign that had fallen off and re-hung it for them. I think the building will fall before the sign does. They work great,5
B0751VFF2X,"Good product for posters! The adhesion is good, but not perfect.",4
B0751VFF2X,"They're easy to put on and leave minimal damage to my posters, if I take them off right. Occasionally, it's a little awkward getting under the poster to take them off. I end up pulling on them at the wrong angle and they can rip, which is the absolute worse because then I'm under the threat of ripping my poster. Otherwise, they're my favorite tool for putting up posters.",4
B00DC4RXF6,"An 8 oz bottle will do about four 500 piece 24x18 puzzles with 3 coats on the front and 1 coat on the back. We do our puzzles on a piece of laminate countertop (a sink cut out) and I've found I can do the glue up right on that and dried puzzle glue peels off, easy as pie. That is convenient because you don't have to worry; you can just brush the edges to seal them too.I apply with a 3"" non-cheapo paintbrush. (Nothing too expensive, but if you use a 99 cent chip brush you'll end up with bristles embedded in your work.) Clean up your brush with water before things dry.  I do one coat on the front by pouring a tablespoon or so on a section at a time and brushing it out. It will pool in the joints, but that's good. Don't worry that it's very white and opaque, it dries clear.After the first coat is on reasonably thick, let it dry several hours, then flip the puzzle over, brush a single coat on the back, and let it dry for a few hours. Then flip back over to the front. At that point, you can do coats about once an hour to build whatever thickness you like. I do one more thick coat, sand smooth with 0000 steel wool to get rid of any brush marks and wipe it clean with a very slightly damp cloth. Then one last coat, very thin with a foam brush, and if there's any brush marks after it dries, a bit more 0000 steel wool. At this point the glued puzzle is quite study but with a bit of flex and a nice glossy surface (about as glossy as a standard puzzle's finish.)",5
B00DC4RXF6,Works great for keeps along and framing puzzles!,5
B00DC4RXF6,"I love this stuff!Dries Clear: The glue is fully transparent when dried so you can see the puzzle art clearlyThin & Runny: The glue is easy to work with and sinks in between the individual pieces, really adhering everything togetherDries Stretchy: I've used other puzzle glues that dry hard, which seems fine at first. If you're not gentle with it, it'll crack and break. Because this glue dries stretchy, it's easier to handle when dry.I recommend putting parchment paper under the puzzle before gluing. It will be an easy clean-up and the puzzle comes right off when dried",5
B00DC4RXF6,Works really well and I love the clear finish. The only things is that I would mostly prefer a sticker on the back rather than a glue now for bigger puzzles. They seem to hold really well but when you pick them up they bend way to easily and a lot of my puzzles have actually fallen apart but it might just be how I set them up for now. I would still use on puzzles less than 1000 personally,4
B00DC4RXF6,Worked perfectly for gluing two puzzles I had finished and wanted to frame. Easy to use and easy cleanup.  I let dry for two days just to be safe before I framed.,5
B00DC4RXF6,We always glue our puzzles once we finish putting them together. This is all i will use for that. Drys clear and firm. I will continue using for as long as i put puzzles together,5
B00DC4RXF6,Spread it in layers on the puzzle & it came out great.,5
B00DC4RXF6,Dries clear,5
B00DC4RXF6,Loved using it on his puzzle.,5
B00DC4RXF6,Not very thick but tick enough to easily use. Dries fast. Makes the puzzle stay together for awhile. Easily cleans up if you spill.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"This works well for gluing puzzles together, but the smell makes me nauseous.",3
B00DC4RXF6,"Bought this to seal a beautiful puzzle I intend to frame. It is easy to use and spread. I used a foam brush which was easy, you can rinse the sponge with soap and water to reuse if you want. Goes on white but dries clear. My only negative is when I used it the first time I noticed the odor others had mentioned. I didn't  think it would bother me but ended up with a headache. No other issues. I did the second coat in my garage and the odor did not bother me as before and no repeat headache. Great price for the amount as I have sealed another puzzle with only one coat and still have more to use on another puzzle.",4
B00DC4RXF6,"We get a lot of custom puzzles made from family photos and we have always hated to take them apart and put them back into the box.  We have used Mod Lodge to permanently bond the puzzle pieces together and we now can frame them as a picture.  Once cured, it is amazingly strong and durable!",5
B00DC4RXF6,"This worked perfectly for holding a 1000 piece puzzle together! The only reason that I took away a star is because I ordered the 8oz bottle and it didn't have a lid on it! Kinda annoying since I didn't use the whole bottle, but then didn't have a lid to store the rest! But as far as the product itself it appears to be holding up nicely on the puzzle and dries nice and clear!",4
B00DC4RXF6,"I thought I had ordered the matted version of this glue. I have used mod podge glue (non puzzle) on puzzles before and found out the hard way that the glue dries in a way that it sticks if you stack puzzles. I have a lot! I figured I would give this product a try since it is made specifically for puzzles, just didn't want them to have a shiny glare on them :(",4
B00DC4RXF6,"The product works as described. It took 2 applications to make my puzzle looks beautiful  and shiny.Although the smell is pretty intense,  this product is highly recommended. It is easy to use, I will buy and use it again if needed.",4
B00DC4RXF6,I just used a business card to spread the glue. It dried clear like second skin without showing any streaks that were visible when applying. I only poured the glue on the front side and it solidified in one piece. Great product!,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Mod Podge is my go to puzzle saver!  It's easy to use, dries in a few minutes and is ready for the next step. Pick up your puzzle in one piece and it's ready to frame. All the time and effort you've put into putting the puzzle together and now it's preserved.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"I bought this, firstly because Mod Podge is a trusted brand and universally used and secondly, because of the price. Compared to previous glue I used, this was a great deal! I have a 3000 piece puzzle that I just finished, and I wanted to preserve my work.Some pros:-Nice finish, although it is a white glue, it dries clear and it isn't too shiny or distracting from the puzzle itself-Plenty of glue to work with, I didn't run out with my 3000 piece-Dries fast! Was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the glue set-Easy clean up, warm water and some soap does the trickCons:-No applicator, I had to makeshift an applicator with an old plastic checkbook cover in order to spread the glue evenly. Don't buy something extra, just use something from home, it's not a big deal-Thin, you will definitely need multiple coats to ensure a secure finish (there is enough glue for this, so don't worry about it, just be prepared)Tips: The nice thing with this glue is that you can see exactly how much glue is in each crevice when you spread it. Focus on the cracks!!! Make sure that each of the crevices are full with glue and don't glob on top of the actual piecesWas my review helpful? I hope it was! If you liked my review, please respond YES below!!! Thanks for reading :)",4
B00DC4RXF6,Holds the puzzle together but is still very fragile,4
B00DC4RXF6,Yes it is a white substance when coming out! But it dries clear. I used 2 coats on the front of my puzzle and one on the back. And it is together. Makes me excited for the puzzle wall I am building!,5
B00DC4RXF6,Works well after 2 coats and has a a shiny finish not bad for the price. The not so thick consistency and smell reminds me of Elmer's glue but thats not a bad thing. Puzzels have held together so far. But I dont recommend  stacking your glued puzzles on top of eachother since they will stick together but that was more my fault than the product itself.,4
B00DC4RXF6,We loved this puzzle so much we decided to keep it and hang it up. Mod Podge puzzle glue dried clear and really does work in keeping the puzzle together.,5
B00DC4RXF6,love love love,5
B00DC4RXF6,"I received the hardest puzzle ever as a gift from my daughter and family along with a beautiful matching cloth bag for Christmas last year.  Her Dad and I spend months putting it together and we know we'll never work it again.  So we used the Puzzle Mod Podge to save it finding directions on the internet.  Since it was worked on a felt backing, we slid waxed paper under the edges to protect the backing and the tablecloth under that.  It worked!  Will we frame it?  Or just had a hanger?  Either way, it is going back to my daughter for her Christmas this year!  HA!",5
B00DC4RXF6,"I did 2 coats on the front of my puzzle, and it dried super fast and help up great!",5
B00DC4RXF6,"This works well enough for a puzzle glue and it does hold the pieces together. However, I had a hard time even a applying it because the odor is so strong and unpleasant. Worse than that, I'd go as far to say that, to me, it smells like a combination combination of rotten eggs and toxic glue. The price might be acceptable but the smell is not. Never again.",2
B00DC4RXF6,"I have done tons of puzzles.  I have never glued one, just looked at it for a few weeks then put it back in the box to put together again at a later date.  First time glueing one together, this worked great!!!  Will defiantly do it again on one that I want to display.",5
B00DC4RXF6,Product was delivered in good condition and got the job done!,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Don't get me wrong, it dries clear, but it goes on a little cloudy-like, which is great for knowing where you might have missed. Too many times I have used the clear kind of puzzle glue only to find after it fried that I missed a spot or two and a piece is loose. This one definitely shows up white between the pieces and you can tell where you need to add a little more. It does put off a smell that might be unpleasant to some. It doesn't bother me.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"Product worked well,looks great.",5
B00DC4RXF6,I started to get into puzzles and wanted to preserve them. I found this puzzle saver and ordered the 2 bottles. I was worried this was not going to work but this helped me preserve about 5-6 puzzles with the 2 small bottles. They definitely hold the pieces together as long as you do about 2 coats front and back but letting them dry completely between coats.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"I have a 4000 piece the world puzzle and this is my first time using mod podge.Pros:1. One bottle covered the entire puzzle with little left over2. Once glued its glued, so thats definitely a plus3. Easy-ish to applyCons:1. It does go on white and dry clear BUT I'm noticing that its not entirely clear. Its more of clear with light whitening, especially in lighter areas.2. It dries very very quick, which is nice but it becomes very tacky even while spreading the glue. I'd recommend working in small sections, but even if you make my mistake, you can semi easily scratch off excess glue with your finger nail and it'll still turn out nice.3. I know it didn't explicitly say it'd come with or without a sponge or spreader, but I wish it would have come with something like other similarly priced gluesIn conclusion I'd probably buy this product again but only if I have a spreader on hand. It'd make the whole process alot better.",4
B00DC4RXF6,I glued puzzle to put in frame and hang up. It did the job. I looked at a few glues and decided on this one.It may have been the Amazon choice and reviews were good.,5
B00DC4RXF6,I use this on my puzzles....2-3 coats and they are able to be hung on the wall.  Works well.,5
B00DC4RXF6,Love it and it works great of any projects that you use Mod podge on.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Covered 2 18 by 28 inch puzzles......3 coats on the front, one coat on the back.Nice finish. Cannot wait to frame!!!",5
B00DC4RXF6,How does this product not include a lid ?,2
B00DC4RXF6,I applied the glue on both sides with a paint brush. It is holding together.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Great product for the price.  We use this to glue our puzzles together.  Dries fairly quick and holds the puzzle together really, really well.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"used this before on another puzzle, i was gifted the same product but with the brush set. ran out of modge podge and had to buy more! i would 100% recommend!i used a silicone kitchen spatula to apply the glue and it worked amazingly :) i wouldn't recommend getting the foam brush set, they lasted me a while but because it is foam, the brush would soak up so much of the glue.i put wax paper under it so it didn't get all over the table. of course accidents happen and sometimes a bit gets where it's not supposed to. once it dries it peels right off, and it washes out with water, very easy clean up!loved this so much, will be buying again!",5
B00DC4RXF6,Works magic with puzzles,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Couldn't be happier with this product. Unlike other reviewers, I never heard of Mod Podge, but relied on the Amazon reviews and bought it. I'd assembled a Liberty brand wooden puzzle of an Audubon painting of Carolina parakeets - no border, all of what would be white space in a ""regular"" puzzle is open space, etc. Loved the puzzle and was hap-hap-happy to get it assembled. My husband and I have a little condo in south Florida and I thought the colors would go nicely with our decor. Is there such a thing as puzzle glue, I wondered? Why yes, there is. I put three coats on the front and one or two on the back, let it dry and just hung it on our wall today. LOVE IT! (Picture enclosed.) Couldn't be happier.P.S. I bought and used the foam brushes that were paired with the glue. I was kind of sloppy in applying the glue and ended up having to use a spatula to scrape the puzzle up from the piece of cardboard on which I'd assembled it, but that worked just fine.",5
B00DC4RXF6,Easy to apply. Holds together all those puzzle pieces into a picture.,5
B00DC4RXF6,Gives it a nice shine,5
B00DC4RXF6,"This stuff really works.  We wanted to frame a puzzle and simply followed the directions on the bottle and it turned out great.  If you are going to try it be sure to buy a few foam brushes, they tended to get saturated easily.  It will make the job easier and quicker.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"We used this on a puzzle we wanted to frame and it worked perfectly. It is easy to use. Initially it looked a little white when I was spreading it onto the puzzle, but it dried clear. In order to fully dry, it took a day or 2.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"Ideal if you are looking to convert your puzzle into a keepsake piece of art. I read a few reviews that mentioned a concern with the glue seeping through and affecting the surface below the puzzle. While it's always a good idea to protect the work surface (we used a 13 gallon white trash bag, flattened), we didn't notice any seepage. This is likely due to the various qualities of puzzles vs. Mod Podge itself. We happen to love Ravensburger puzzles, the quality of their puzzles is such that there is no room between the thick pieces for seepage to occur. The first coat we applied was to the back of the puzzle as it made sense based on our project plan. After just one thin coat to the back of the puzzle, I could carefully pick up the 1000 piece puzzle as if it were a single piece. Easy to correct mistakes, and clean up is a breeze. Highly recommended! We used Mod Podge Scrapbooking Foam Brush Set, 24959 (4-Piece) < https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CH9LH86/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_27 > with the Mod Podge.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"Ok this puzzle glue is amazing. I have added photos of the puzzles I have done and glued with one 8oz bottle. I also added a photo of the sponge paint brush that I used to apply the glue. One bottle glue I was able to do: 2-500 piece, 2-550 piece, 1-750 piece and 1-1500 piece puzzles. I only did one coat on my puzzles except the 750 piece I did two coats of glue on it. I used the smaller brush to make sure it got into every crack of the puzzle pieces. The glue dries fast. I didnt have any problem with the puzzles warping, however, I also framed all the puzzles as soon as they were done drying. I will, from now on, only use this puzzle glue.",5
B00DC4RXF6,I have been looking a puzzle glue for quite some time and this IS IT. This really works and you only need a couple thin layers. I applied one layer and then waited 30 minutes before applying the next layer. If you need a third layer I'd recommend waiting until the next day to apply that later so that it doesn't get too gooey and ruin your puzzle.,5
B00DC4RXF6,The media could not be loaded.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"I was skeptical but this would be worth the $9 oh, but a little bit went a long way and I will be able to use this multiple times. I did several light coats using a foam sponge applicator, and change directions each time. In certain lights you can see streaks, but I think this was applied smoothly, dried evenly, and overall I am very pleased with the product.",4
B00DC4RXF6,"I have glued 4 puzzles of 3000 pieces+ and the results are consistent.  It goes on white but dries clear. It does leave a texture behind, but in some way adds to the depth of the picture and makes it feel a little more alive. Usually we leave wax paper underneath our puzzle construction so that when we glue it the glue will just adhere to the sheets or the puzzle which is easy enough to clean up and throw away.  If you don't the puzzle does tend to stick a little more with whatever you're working on your puzzle with but wont ruin your puzzle if you're careful.  All in all this is the best puzzle glue on the market by the way it works.  Pair with some sponge brushes and fill every little crack and you won't be disappointed.",5
B00DC4RXF6,Easy y.to use. Dries quickly.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"The first bottle I every bought came with a spreading tool which I thankfully kept since these bottles do not. The glue itself is easy to apply and holds well, drying completely clear. I always glue the picture side first, let it dry for a day and then flip the puzzle over and glue the back side to ensure it holds together. If I were framing the puzzle I don't think gluing both sides would be necessary however since I can't afford to frame all the puzzles I do,I simply glue and hang them using Command Strips. Overall I've been very pleased with the product - have purchased at least 5 bottles over the years.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"My only downside to this is the size of the container.  When i get one puzzle done, i start on another. the just completed one is glued one both sides, front twice and rear once as i adhere to a slim panel and then hang on wall.  11 down and 12 to go.",4
B00DC4RXF6,"Recently, I used this to preserve a Baby Yoda puzzle that my boyfriend and I completed. The product worked perfectly. It goes on white, like Elmer's glue, and is easy to spread over the top of the puzzle using a basic brush. I opted to use a sponge which made it a bit easier to get the excess back into the container. Once you have it covered to your liking, just set a timer for about 20 minutes and let it dry. It does dry clear. I opted to do one coat on the front and the back and that seemed to do the trick. Highly recommend.",5
B00DC4RXF6,Worked great on the puzzle we put together. We put Mod Podge on both sides and mounted the puzzle in a large frame to hang on the wall. No glass cover necessary.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"I used it on a puzzle I put together.  I did wind up using a bit too much of it at first....but the results still came out great.  I used almost the entire bottle on a 1500 piece puzzle, but that's from me overdoing it a bit.  I also glued the front and back of the puzzle.  It goes on like a milky white, but dries with a nice added gloss to it.  I let the front dry for about an hour and then did the back.  When I did the back, I immediately attached it to a foam board for mounting and the glue held it all together.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"It was just what I needed, it kept the puzzle together.",5
B00DC4RXF6,First time I've framed a puzzle and this did a very good job. I highly recommend. dries fast and the finished puzzle is beautiful.  I chose the Matte finish.,5
B00DC4RXF6,Goes on easily and does not leave a residue. Just clear. Have used on other crafts and worked as well.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Good product but I had a brand new puzzle with 2 missing pieces. I made though pieces tried to get them to stay in place, but pieces would not stay in place and could not write with a marker on glue. I will not be buying it again.",2
B00DC4RXF6,Great stuff.  Some of the puzzle pieces weren't flat but this glue still held the pieces together.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"We have used this many times. We glued five 1000-piece puzzles with this one jar. It is effortless to use and dries quickly. It is nice and clear, so the puzzle looks great hung up.",5
B00DC4RXF6,It was very easy to apply and worked great. Only used it for the backside of puzzle. It can be used on front too. Will need a small paint brush.,5
B00DC4RXF6,works as it should,5
B00DC4RXF6,Used this to glue/seal four puzzles. Easy to use. No hassles. Product does exactly what it says it does. Great product.,5
B00DC4RXF6,I did 2 layers on the back and front. Be careful when you do the other side some of it seeps through the other sides or the edges so make sure to wipe it down.When placing it use a sponge or a good brush. Mine dried with some brush marks but could be better with a different applicator.Smell is strong so use a mask and place it on wax paper or parchment before use.,5
B00DC4RXF6,"Mod Podge may be a bit more expensive than other puzzle savers, but absolutely the best that I've used and I will not use anything else after experiencing disappointing results with other brands. This dries fast and clear, seals well and is very easy to apply. Be warned - it smells terrible when you are applying so do that in a well ventilated area! However, there is no residual smell when the puzzle dries. Typical I do two coats on front of puzzle and one on back - works like a charm.",5
B00DC4RXF6,"I painted this whitish liquid on a finished jigsaw puzzle and within minutes I had a solid puzzle.  It dries clear and glues the pieces together.  I recommend this for any jigsaw puzzle you just cannot bear to undo,",5
B00DC4RXF6,"We added this to our subscriptions, my dad swears by it and has puzzle hanging everywhere in his pool room.",5
B00DC4RXF6,As usual this is a great product. I wouldn't use any other glue for my puzzles.,5
B00DC4RXF6,Very easy to use liked the quality after used on puzzle and one coat was ample to cover my 750 piece puzzle. First time to use this so used on bottom of puzzle first to see how it worked and dried rather quickly and didn't lower the quality of the look of the picture so I did entire picture and after letting dry for about an hour maybe a little less I was able to frame and hangup. So I am pleased with and will continue to buy this product. Also I just did the front of the puzzle I could have turned over to do the back but didn't find that it was needed.,5
B00DC4RXF6,First time using this product and it went well.  I was a little apprehensive to paint this over the face of the puzzle as it goes on a little milky but it dried completely clear and made handling the puzzle to place in a frame so much easier than prior attempts.  I will use it on any future puzzles I plan on using as art.,4
B00DC4RXF6,"It was applied to a puzzle by my partner.  He had a difficult time spreading it evenly. He said you need a fine sponge, preferably one that has not been used before, to avoid streak marks.",4
B00DC4RXF6,It looks white and pasty at first but just give it an hour and it looks nice and glossy. Put a couple coats on my puzzle and it sticks together perfectly,5
B00DC4RXF6,The media could not be loaded.,5
B00DC4RXF6,I really like this product and it has a lot of different uses. It was at a good price too. Highly recommend,5
B00DC4RXF6,Worked great for our 1000 piece puzzle!We did 2 coats on the back and 3 coats on the front and still have left over!!,5
B00DC4RXF6,Very easy to apply delivering excellent results.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I made a few wax melts and a small candle. It took almost twice the amount of pellets as American Organic Soy wax that I also get off Amazon.,5
B07NMNDT1W,Perfect for my homemade lotion!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Good product for making salve,5
B07NMNDT1W,"Functional, Awesome valur for the money ,Quick shipping , a little goes a long way !",5
B07NMNDT1W,"These work great for my purpose but it's not yellow like the picture, it's white.",4
B07NMNDT1W,Very easy to use. Melted easily using a double boiler method.... I hung my glass pyrex measuring cup over another pan it worked great! I have enough left for many more crafts!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Loved how this melted and helped blend things together when we made homemade lipgloss!,5
B07NMNDT1W,"I put this on three different scales and it still comes up 3 oz short, I know and I realize that people are going to say wow it's only 3 oz, well I paid for those 3 oz. Three stars is what I'm giving it because it melts really well and it's a good quality wax and ,I don't understand why they wanted to short me on it. Maybe because it didn't fit in the box that they put it in it burst open Amazon had to repackage it in a bag. But the plastic bag was zip tied so it didn't open and the ounces spell out.",3
B07NMNDT1W,Perfect for my lotions and salves.,5
B07NMNDT1W,While the product worked fine it appeared to have been melted and clumped together making it a messTo measure out,4
B07NMNDT1W,Beeswax is sticky and has a relatively low melting point.,5
B07NMNDT1W,Love this bees wax for fall/winter candle making. This was the best deal I could find with the highest quality (for the price I was willing to spend :). it's a winter tradition and brings coziness to the house:),5
B07NMNDT1W,"Great quality, Great price, melts Great.",5
B07NMNDT1W,Quality,5
B07NMNDT1W,I'm always happy with this product that's why I have bought it several times,5
B07NMNDT1W,"The product itself is great - but, the first package to arrive, the bag was busted open and spilled out everywhere upon arrival. The second package (to replace the first), was also busted open on the bottom upon arrival, however, was not spilled out. I love the product, but packaging is poor and always breaking.",3
B07NMNDT1W,These pellets were used to make chapstick. They melt down easily and have no odor. The final product wasn't waxy but left my lips feeling moisturized and soft.,5
B07NMNDT1W,Love this product love the bag seals !!! Easy to use and store and works amazing in my face creams !!!,5
B07NMNDT1W,"These beeswax pellets have been a good purchase. I have used them for coating fabric for beeswax wraps for food, coating outside linens for summer. The key to coating fabric is either ironing the fabric when flat or heating in the oven to coat and cooling. The smell they have is neutral and it melts without issue. I plan to use them to replace candles that have been used. The pellets hold essential oils well in the candles and burn cleanly. Would purchase again!",5
B07NMNDT1W,Requires a higher temp to melt then real beeswax.  I suspect this is largely paraffin.,3
B07NMNDT1W,I love this product.  It's  totally easy to use. The quality of the candles are sturdy and glossy when fully cured. This product is definitely a great value for the price. You can create loads of candles depending on the sizes. I can't say anything about the smell except there wasn't one unless you add your own scent to it. But overall it's a great product to use for your candle making needs.,5
B07NMNDT1W,"We made some lavender salve and boy, this product combine with the oil made skin so soft.  Nothing is greasy - just really soft skin.  We were surprised at even with pellets being this small, it took about 20-25 minutes to dissolve.  We love the white color, but I will be purchasing the yellow option if they have it.  We love this beeswax.",5
B07NMNDT1W,Worked wonderfully,5
B07NMNDT1W,Very pleased with this product - will be my go-to for all my product recipes that call for beeswax!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Exactly what I was wanting and no rips or tars in the bag thank you so much,5
B07NMNDT1W,"While I'm still very new at making my own diaper rash cream, When it doesn't come out right, I do more research. It said this time to add Beeswax for a creamier feel & less greasy. Problem I run in to is I don't use a recipe. It's always guess work with something new added to the mixture. So far, I'm on the right track with all the recommendations. Still working on finding the right mxture but before trying it on the adult that needs it, having had to deal with dry skin my entire life, i always try it on myself first. If it helps me and no allergic reaction, it works on the person that really needs it & BEST oF All, when you see what stores are charging for 14,15,16 oz jars, this is so much more affordable than not only the brand names but the store brands and everything else available......AND IT WORKS.",5
B07NMNDT1W,"I use beeswax for various household uses including lotion making, candle making, and woodworking.  This beeswax is excellent quality with no additions or fillers.  Because it comes in these small pellets, weighing and melting is super easy and the melt point is consistent.  Overall I'm extremely happy with this beeswax and will undoubtedly order more.",5
B07NMNDT1W,I used these to make homemade lotion and they were fabulous! Great for skin and worked wonderfully! Highly recommend!,5
B07NMNDT1W,High quality.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I read 2lbs and was expecting a small bag but it's honestly a lot!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Ok,5
B07NMNDT1W,I use this wax for the tea light candles and 3 inch cancdles and it works very well.,5
B07NMNDT1W,"Melts easily, nice sized packaging. Works for me.",5
B07NMNDT1W,This product did everything we were wanting,5
B07NMNDT1W,Exactly as described and easy to use.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I used this beeswax to make some lip balm. This was my first time making lip balm so it was a learning experience. I did have a hard time melting the beeswax the first time. My double boiler was just not getting hot enough. I did my research and after learning how hot it needs to be to melt and trying again it worked great. Great product. I will be ordering again!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Unfortunately I don't believe this is pure beeswax. It smelled like crayons and when it burned it did not have that purifying sweet smell that organic beeswax has and held a harsh flame with a lot of soot. I also noticed the texture is off. I'm wondering if this was mixed with parrafin wax or cut with a lower quality beeswax. Either way I learned my lesson buying from amazon and will stick with my local beeswax seller.,2
B07NMNDT1W,Ive made tons of candles with this wax! Would buy again.,5
B07NMNDT1W,No complaints here. Use this with olive oil to make comfrey salve and it works great.,5
B07NMNDT1W,Much easier to use then shaving a block,5
B07NMNDT1W,"This product doesn't smell like real beeswax. The strange petroleum or motor oil smell is overwelming and makes me doubt the discription of ""Pure"" ""Natural"" and ""Filtered"". I don't feel right about using this on bare skin. However, if you plan to wax furniture, shoes or other objects then I guess it is fine.",2
B07NMNDT1W,Great product!!! Melts easy like it a lot!! Using for homemade lotions and deodorant and salves!!,5
B07NMNDT1W,"When receiving my product, it appears to have been cut open or ripped  :(",2
B07NMNDT1W,Great value and easy to use.  I use them to hasten shampoo bars.  Work great.,5
B07NMNDT1W,"One bag of these pellets made a decent amount of four oz candles. I am now on my second bag from the company to finish out about 9 candles! I may also use for lip balms and hand lotion. I just used a soup pot filled with water and glass measuring cup to melt the beeswax. We added coconut oil to help lengthen the amount of wax to make more candles as well. Overall, very pleased with this product! Cannot wait to gift the candles.",5
B07NMNDT1W,Bought to make homemade breastmilk lotion for my newborn.  I had no idea how little I needed and how much came in this bag haha.  I'll be using this forever. Worked great though!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Got these as I am starting on my journey of making all the things instead of buying. These worked great! They melted well and I am very pleased with the ease of using them.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I like this bees wax. Easy to melt. I didnt expect the package to be this big. Its a lot,5
B07NMNDT1W,This has worked well in the creams and lotion bars I make,5
B07NMNDT1W,love this wax. i make a lot of candles and i have tried other wax and i come back to this. love it,5
B07NMNDT1W,"This is our first experience making candles, I am not convinced this is actually beeswax but it did work well for us to make hand dipped candles.",4
B07NMNDT1W,Used this to make dog paw balm. Packaging is great and easy to use. Pellets were easy to work with.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I initially bought the stuff to re-waterproof one of my Carhartt jackets. I would recommend getting a double boiler and a paintbrush to do that but super easy to use pellets melted evenly and easily no complaints still holding up to this day.,5
B07NMNDT1W,These are so cool and useful,5
B07NMNDT1W,I was surprised at the quality of the beeswax especially given the price. The resealable packaging was also a huge plus since I only needed a little to make my chapsticks. Highly recommend!,5
B07NMNDT1W,I bought this beeswax to make reusable food wraps. It worked perfectly and I loved that the tiny pellets were clear so it didn't stain the fabric. My beeswax wraps came out perfect!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Great quality! You get what you pay for. Small and easy to use (melt) pellets. The color is perfect for making candles because you can add whatever colorant you want and the color of the wax will not affect it!!!,5
B07NMNDT1W,Used for making salve.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I use this beeswax in my THC lip balms and salves.  Love the fact that it's low odor so I don't have to try and cover up the beeswax smell.  Melts great! Great product.,5
B07NMNDT1W,"Perfect for making your own candles and much more! I made lotion out of them, and it worked really well! No strange scents.",5
B07NMNDT1W,"If you are looking for bee wax, this is the one you've been looking for!",5
B07NMNDT1W,"Back when I first began making salves in my herbal kitchen...I purchase beeswax in blocks or bars.Sometimes they would harden very quickly.However, these beeswax pellets melt very quickly and easily.  The melted form is smooth and consistent in texture.",5
B07NMNDT1W,"While I like the wax, and it works for what I need, I was a little disappointed in the packaging. The bag had ripped in the corner, and the wax pellets had come out all over the outer box packaging and items in the same shipping box. Great product, but packaging should be a little more flexible if possible.",4
B07NMNDT1W,Works really well for making bullet lube. Melts easily and easy to measure,5
B07NMNDT1W,"Used these pellets in a magnesium, cream.  They take a little longer to melt than the other ingredients, but once done, worked perfectly.  Good product.  Good price.",5
B07NMNDT1W,I ORIGINALLY thought this product caused contact dermatitis but it was something I was taking orally. This works just fine for my home-made flea salve.,4
B07NMNDT1W,"I bought these beeswax pellets to create beeswax wraps, and as some other reviewers have noted, there is a faint whiff of something that doesn't smell like beeswax to these pellets. I hope they're pure beeswax, as advertised, but I have no way to check.  I used them with jojoba oil to create a few wraps and I hope they're going to be OK. Otherwise they melted fairly quickly and made for nice wraps.",3
B07NMNDT1W,Bought these for use in craft projects. Very happy with the purchase.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I just thought it was a great product.,5
B07NMNDT1W,This is a great project for making salves and lotions.,5
B07NMNDT1W,Easy to measure,5
B07NMNDT1W,I apply food grade mineral oil let it dry. Then heat and apply this food grade wax.,5
B07NMNDT1W,I've purchased this product  many times this last year and it has always been soft and silky feeling. This last one is very hard and clumped together.  Some of it even feels crispy.,2
B07NMNDT1W,"The product is WAY TOO PROCESSED to the point of barely being beeswax anymore. Open the bag and the odor of gasoline/petrol is overwhelming. I ordered two bags and both smell so bad that I cannot use them in my skin care products. I even let the bags off-gas for a week (standing open) to see if that helped- it did not. What a waste. Do not order this. ""Triple Filtered"" apparently means they over process it like plastic. All nutritive qualities of natural beeswax are gone.  Would you put lotion on your skin if it smelled like car exhaust and gas?!Cosmetic grade.",1
B07NMNDT1W,I bought this to seal a wooden cutting board & wooden teething rings. It suits its purpose perfectly.,5
B07NMNDT1W,"I bought this some time ago and just had the opportunity to use it for making some balms.  Although it does has a slight yellow tint, the product came out completely white once melted down.  I did not detect an odor as the other reviews stated.  It has been perfectly fine for me.  I am kicking myself now for not putting it on auto-ship now that my business is running well.  This product is wonderful and was not waxy at all.  Will definitely buy again in the future.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Great for posters and small metal signs. Holds good adhesive good easy to use easy application. Durability good totally recommend,5
B00BT0MW4W,Purchased to use for a party I was decorating to put up decor. It did its job and i would purchase again for upcoming events. Great product!,5
B00BT0MW4W,"I got nothing else to say really, I guess the stickiness near the corners weren't working sometimes, but it still did it's job and there's a lot for a low price, so that's why I give it 4 stars.",4
B00BT0MW4W,3m makes the best wall hanging products. These were easy to use.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"Bought an off-brand...was garbage, didn't stick after a few weeks in multiple instances.  Never again.  Some of my stuff has been hanging for years.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Like using those on posters or pictures to hang on the wall great quality,5
B00BT0MW4W,Loved these! Used them to update an apartment and left no residue!,5
B00BT0MW4W,These things really work,5
B00BT0MW4W,Just ok,4
B00BT0MW4W,"The tape failed after 2 months.  Also, the tape did not come off cleanly, it took off the paint under the tape.",3
B00BT0MW4W,I use these for my kpop posters all the time. I love them! Super easy to take off as well.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"These strips are okay. I'm using one on each corner of some cardboard box art to hang on my wall plus cleaning the area with alcohol. They hold up the cardboard pretty well unless I get into some that have thicker sides and doesn't hold. So far I've had a few that didn't have the sticky part that goes towards the wall. I thought that was how the strips were supposed to be at first but they aren't. The ones that work are sticky. Last thing, I had to remove them a few times and they were easy to pull off (pull down towards the ground, not towards yourself) without damaging the wall or my box art. Overall, not bad.",4
B00BT0MW4W,They stick,5
B00BT0MW4W,Arrived quickly,5
B00BT0MW4W,I have used a lot of these and they work great.  Just don't think you'll be able to put them in your drawer for 2 years and still expect them to work.,5
B00BT0MW4W,I hung up posters on my walls at work and didn't want to make holes. The wallpaper is textured. My first attempt had the posters falling off the wall. Apply the strips to the wall first rub well then apply the poster. It's been weeks now of them staying on the wall.,4
B00BT0MW4W,These do a pretty good job. I used them to hang a bunch of posters in my office. They all stayed up but a couple of them came loose after a couple of years. I went to replace them and discovered all the leftovers I had were entirely dried out and had no adhesion in them whatsoever.,4
B00BT0MW4W,"These are amazing -- easy to place, easy to remove. They don't damage walls or paint.  Our classroom has high humidity over the weekend when they turn off a/c or heat -- and too often on Monday you find all your posters, etc, lying on the floor. These consistently hold up-- stay put.  Yet, they're so easy to remove with the pull tab.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Works exactly as I expected.,5
B00BT0MW4W,Command Strips to hang stuff. Always work when I use them.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"I used these to adhere thin glass panels to the wall for my home gym. They do an absolutely amazing job of holding the glass panels to the wall. A little too amazing. I cannot get them off without taking the paint with it. I realize that this is the point of command strips. In fact, I bought them because I thought they would allow for easy removal without destroying my wall. However, the ease of removal without taking the paint depends on what you are adhering. You either need to be using a pliable material like paper so that you can pull up a corner to access the command strip or you need to allow the command strip to hang down past the end of the material so that you can pull the strip. This I did not do because a) the instructions did not say to do it and b) then I couldn't have gotten all my panels to line up without gaps.",4
B00BT0MW4W,Great for posters/pictures. Has all held up well,5
B00BT0MW4W,"These definitely DO work with soundproof foam. You just have to install it correctly.1.) Peel one side of the command strip, place it on one of the top corners of the foam piece. Do this again for the opposite bottom corner. (Just like in the picture.)2.) Firmly press both strips against the foam by pinching your thumb and fingers together for 10 seconds. You will not damage or alter the foam in any way by doing this.3.) Peel the other side of the command strips. Place it on the wall in your desired spot and press HARD against the wall for at least 10 seconds. Make sure you're applying that pressure right on top of the command strips. Again, this won't hurt the foam or your wall.Works great! I've had zero issues with the soundproofing falling or not sticking properly. Just make sure to follow the steps and you'll get great results. Hope this helps!",5
B00BT0MW4W,Works well and holds as needed,5
B00BT0MW4W,"The strips are easy to use, and if done properly, will keep pictures up on the wall.  They are easy to remove and don't leave a mark on the wall.  Great product.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Gives my posters a secure setting. Thanks for the timely service. Peace,5
B00BT0MW4W,"I bought several of these 5 years ago, two have fallen off the door.  I decided to remove them and install screwed on hooks, and I discovered that the thin sticky backing does not come off.  I researched and found little good advice.  So I tried WD-40, and it worked with much effort and scrubbing.  I also tried plastic razor blades, and this also worked with much effort.  I highly recommend against them as they do not come off cleanly.  I will not use them again.",1
B00BT0MW4W,Love that I can get 'replace' strips for the hooks.  Use them all the time.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"Y'all what can I say? I use command hooks, strips, velcro picture hangers, etc for just about any purpose. I challenge myself to find new uses for them around my house. So far, they have never failed me. I have tried alt products (off brands) and some of them work great but others fall off the wall, with Command, every single one holds until I cleanly remove them.I have used them to secure full length mirrors, measuring cup holders, and coaxial cable line.  I pop a few velco command strips onto the bottom of my echo dots to secure them vertically to any surface, even the mirror in the bathroom. Perfect.Just clean the surfaces well (I use rubbing alcohol), let them dry and get busy.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Good value,4
B00BT0MW4W,They do what they say they do. Ithey hold a good amount of weight. If you take them off correctly they don't peel paint. Be careful that you don't break the tab when removing.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"These are for hanging paper!Thats all. I  attempted to hang foam 12""x12"" and immediately fell to the floor. PAPER ONLY!",4
B00BT0MW4W,"I've been looking for a while now for a solution to mounting a sectional poster I have. The poster sections are spray-glued onto chalk board, so they're a bit heavier than just a poster and I'd been having trouble finding something capable of holding them up. But these strips did the trick! Two days later and they seem to be holding strong. I'll update this review if that changes. I saw a number of reviews saying that these didn't work well at all. Make sure you read the instructions! There's a poster side and a wall side to the strips, and it matters!",5
B00BT0MW4W,Good quality product.  Found for a great price on sale online.  Would buy again.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"I use these for almost everything now. I started using them in my dorm to hang my surge protectors, hanging organizers, pictures, and other wall decorations, and when they lasted all year without fail and were somewhat reusable in the years after, I brought them into my classroom and my home. I always like to have some on hand, and buying them Amazon at the price they were at was too good of a deal to pass up. This is a product I would be willing to pay normal price for.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"They work perfectly to hold the tiny 1 1/4""x2 1/2"" cardstock gallery labels that we have on the walls in our art gallery which is what we bought them for so I'm happy with them. So far they've also removed cleanly but I've been very slow and careful with taking them off because I can see their potential to take paint with them. Unfortunately I also tried to hang an 8x10 canvas temporarily with them and it fell off the wall and dented the corner even with three on each side and two across the top so don't try using them for anything even remotely heavy. That's not what they're made for though so I didn't dock them a star.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Very strong and hold up to its claims. Friends recommended I use it and it really is a good adhesive product. Works well for my posters and foam pin boards. I did have a mishap where the boards fell off the wall (this was about a month after I put them up) but I stick them back up and they still hold. I think the heat wave just cause my walls to expand (mobile home walls) causing them to fall off but otherwise they are on strong,5
B00BT0MW4W,work great,5
B00BT0MW4W,"It just doesn't work too well when it gets really humid. Things just fall down, so I wouldn't recommend it on heavier objets. One workaround is to put up your wall art when it is dry. Then it forms a stronger bond, and when the humid season rolls around, there is a better chance it won't fall off. Trying to use it during a humid season is a bad idea, in my opinion.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"Ive used these 3M strips for years in various apartments to customize closets, pantries, and hallways for hats, posters, and many kitchen utensils.I stretch the sticky tab and slowly pull down and the hook comes off easily. I have a lunch box full of hooks I reuse again and again. Even the ""velcro"" ones work well for many situations.You do have to be careful on very porous paint jobs because they CAN rip the pain off, even if you just stuck them down. The key to good removal is to follow the instructions, and pulling slow is best.These strip are really nice and just create a whole world of small storage ideas.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"These work great BUT they do not work with felt, foam, or acoustic foam. Works for everything else",5
B00BT0MW4W,"These hold well, yet release fairly easily.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"These are great and easy to apply.  The can be removed from walls and won't ruin walls or furniture BUT you must take them off correctly.  Pull the tab straight down so that the adhesive starts to stretch and slowly peel of the wall.  Hold it until it snaps off and voila - clean wall, no paint chip.  Highly recommend this for anyone who wants to hang up decor in a dorm or rental space without ruining the walls.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Work well and as intended,5
B00BT0MW4W,They are great and really easy to use but they don't stick sometimes,4
B00BT0MW4W,"I use these to hold up 12""x12"" acoustic foam and they work well if done properly. They're prone to fall if you place your strips on the wall first.Adhere your strips on the foam tile BEFORE you place on the wall. Firmly press the strips into the foam for a good 30 seconds. Then let the tiles sit for a few minutes before placing them.2-3 strips are good for walls. For ceilings, use 3-4 strips.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"These are great for holding paper, but not a whole lot else. In some ways they're more convenient than using tape or washi tape, but these adhesive tabs are thicker, so if you want something totally flat against a wall, just use tape.",4
B00BT0MW4W,These worked well to hang a very large print-out (large as in 3 feet high by 5 feet long). Six of them held the poster up well and allowed me to pull the paper taut - tacks would have worked but would have left pin holes and wouldn't have allowed me to pull the paper taut. My only issue is that the last one pulled up a bit of the wall paint when I was removing it.,4
B00BT0MW4W,I buy these for my kids every year. My daughter hung the same posters in her dorm rooms for 4 years without damaging them. They are a must have for college students.,5
B00BT0MW4W,Pretty simple and effective to use. Seems to hold its adhesion well over the past few months.,4
B00BT0MW4W,"I'm using these to help display some small stuff. They're easy to apply and hold great. No damage. They put different backings on the wall side and item side so you can easily use the correct one. This was a good value. Lots of them for a low price. It will take me a while, but I'll use them all eventually!",5
B00BT0MW4W,"Totally disregard any reviews saying these don't stick to acoustic foam, they just don't have enough common sense to know you're supposed to firmly put 4 command strips on each corner of the acoustic panel THEN stick it to the wall with considerable force for it to stay. It's been a month without a single panel popping off.",5
B00BT0MW4W,The strips worked very well. I was surprised how good they hold. The selling point for me was if you want to remove the posters (which we all do) they come off the wall AND off the poster without any damage.. As long as you follow the directions they  work perfectly,5
B00BT0MW4W,If you're reading a review on poster strips you're too particular. They're poster strips. They hang posters on walls. Done deal. End of story. They work fantastic & come off mostly clean. The poster is great too but y'all have no idea what posters I hung with this so oh well BUT without these poster strips it wouldn't have been possible so yay A+!,5
B00BT0MW4W,Love everything in the command line.  Things stick and there are no holes in the wall or residue/damage to paint.,5
B00BT0MW4W,Used these to decorate my whole house. These come in handy when you can never find the studs on your walls. I love the big pack because even though I finally have everything up in my home I still have plenty of command strips for whenever I need. These are just so convenient and a nice addition to the junk drawer lol.,5
B00BT0MW4W,love this product,5
B00BT0MW4W,"Good stickiness. I don't quite like that it can pull paint off of walls, but otherwise it's a good product. I don't stick these directly on posters that I use to hang up because the tape parts are quite strong. Strong enough to hang up photo frames and other stuff.",4
B00BT0MW4W,"I was very uncertain about these little things actually holding something up, let alone being removable. But they do both! I love them and try to keep them on hand. Trouble is I keep finding uses for them.",5
B00BT0MW4W,Great for posters and Prints but you would have to use more for much bigger posters. Overtime it does start to lose adhesion on bigger posters,4
B00BT0MW4W,Love the Command Poster Hanging Strips. They work great and hold just about anything. A great product and I love it and will order more. They hold nicely and do not loose the hold no matter how long I have it hung up. The take down is easy and simple as well. I love this product,5
B00BT0MW4W,This is a very good product and it does what it is supposed to do. I prefer not to have holes inmy walls so this is the perfect item to hang my frames. This product is durable and strongand holds up anything you hang on your wall in place. I highly recommend!,5
B00BT0MW4W,Perfect small size for posters and do a great job on delicate walls,5
B00BT0MW4W,"Used these to keep my posters, art prints, and frames up within a space I'm renting so that I wouldn't have to worry about putting wholes in the what with nails or tacks and it did amazingly. It kept all of my wall decor up with out damaging the wall or the stuff itself for well over a year. It came off the walls with ease and I seriously recommend these to anyone!",5
B00BT0MW4W,Worth the price,5
B00BT0MW4W,"It really holds up my posters well. Before this purchase, I just used regular Scotch tape and the posters would keep calling every few hours. I think it's because my walls aren't smooth. Ever since I bought these strips, they've all stayed sturdy on my walls and hasn't come off.",5
B00BT0MW4W,I only use 3M Command to hang posters on my classroom walls.  They are the only thing that sticks to the cement walls.  They are so easy to apply and remove.  I have been using them for 3-4 years and I will continue to use them.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"Decent product, don't want to penalize the company for my mistake in purchasing.. I thought I was getting the strips that lock together similarly to velcro. These will not suit the purpose for which I bought them, but they should be excellent for hanging posters without a frame,",4
B00BT0MW4W,Very useful,5
B00BT0MW4W,"Works great, and at a fraction of the cost you'd find in a Staples or drug store! I use them for everything and have never had an issue with residue, paint removal, or falling off.Make sure you follow their instructions carefully, and only use these for poster-like things (flexible). For stiff objects, like switches and picture frames, use the hooks or velcro variety.",5
B00BT0MW4W,I used them to hang a bunch of posters for a school party. They made the job much easier. Some posters were mounted on posterboards.  These were strong enough to hold the extra weight. I can not comment on how long they could last.,5
B00BT0MW4W,"I bought them for my daughter to put up her posters which kept falling down with other double-sided tape.  These, however, work great and keep the posters up on the walls where they belong.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"I used these straps for posters and then seem ok, there is one poster that is heavier than normal, probably 2 lbs, and it keeps falling. Likewise, if you hang any weight with these they will fall, no excuses.",3
B00BT0MW4W,"Seems fake or just low quality adhesive. Sticks on wall, but not stick well on foam pads. Had to drive to Home Depot to buy a roll of 3M TM double sided tape for the sound proof acoustic pads to stick better.",3
B00BT0MW4W,"Amazing product. Does just what it says. Used it to stick some posters on the wall ,was such an easy job to remove them and 0 marks on the wall.",5
B00BT0MW4W,"Wish they were a bit stronger and more versatile, had to use super glue to attach what I intended to use these for.",4
B00BT0MW4W,"We used them on posters of all sizes. Some as small as 8"" x 12"" some as big as 40"" x 60"". It was the same end result for all of them. After a couple of months all the posters started to get wrinkles in them. By 6 months one by one the posters started to fall off the walls. They all fell within the span of a couple weeks, no matter the size of the poster, meaning these strips clearly have a shelf life on them.",2
B07FFM3DPB,Super colorful and the perfect size! For 7 dollars you get a good amount and they seem really high quality. They were perfect for my Halloween costume and so fun!,5
B07FFM3DPB,Variety of crafty use cheap price soft size of fluffy,5
B07FFM3DPB,"The product was perfect for what I needed it for but smaller than expected. I did see that it was 400 and assumed it would be enough for my kids but we did run out quickly. Since the pompoms are small we did have to use more than anticipated for the project but otherwise the color was great and vibrant, the kids had fun, it was very soft and fluffy, and I was able to make it work for about 30 kids.",5
B07FFM3DPB,included with giggly eyes,5
B07FFM3DPB,Exactly what we needed for a project. Great choice of colors.,5
B07FFM3DPB,They worked great for a Halloween costume! Stuck on fabric perfect,5
B07FFM3DPB,Fun!,5
B07FFM3DPB,Product was delivered on time and met our needs.,5
B07FFM3DPB,Kids loved them,5
B07FFM3DPB,There was a nice variety of colors. However they were very squished in the container. I tried to fluffy them up but it was hard to. You can see at the top were I used the majority it's uneven and doesn't match the other pom poms that I bought elsewhere.,5
B07FFM3DPB,My cat is loving them !,5
B07FFM3DPB,This was perfect for crafts with children.,5
B07FFM3DPB,I bought these to put on top of miniature liquor bottles for and adult easter hunt.  It made them stand out and the folks collecting the bottles could see where they were.  It was a fun addition to an old school tradition.,5
B07FFM3DPB,na,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Good quality, color, size and value",5
B07FFM3DPB,"I purchased this for my daughter's 100th day project at kindergarten. I made a big heart shape with 100 of these pompoms. It was so cute! I have a lot left, so we worked on other craft project. Nice pompons!",5
B07FFM3DPB,"received just as advertised, no issues",5
B07FFM3DPB,Great color assortment. Like the 1 inch size. Glues to objects easily. Would buy again.,5
B07FFM3DPB,Comes in different sizes and colors. Great for arts and crafts. Good addition to any crafts materials.,5
B07FFM3DPB,We have so much fun using these for homeschool projects.,5
B07FFM3DPB,My Grand Daughter is a Nanny and uses these items for projects with the children she cares for.,5
B07FFM3DPB,This was exactly what I needed.,5
B07FFM3DPB,As listed. I like the container it comes in as it has a little carry handle and screw on lid.,5
B07FFM3DPB,Fun for little hands to pick up with little plastic tools I also got. Can also make pictures by gluing balls on paper.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"The pom poms are squished the in the container and lose their shape as a result.  While I made the best of the situation, given the craft project I needed them for, they never regained their shape.  The are not firm, circles.",2
B07FFM3DPB,"They came in a nice Container, they just are alot smaller than what was advertised. Glad I ordered 2 since the size is smaller and we need bigger ones.",3
B07FFM3DPB,Had a lot in it. And more small pom poms .,4
B07FFM3DPB,Love these and I will be using them on Wednesday when the clients make flower pot bunnies.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Cheap, easy, no mess fun for our cats -- they pretend they are mice",5
B07FFM3DPB,"The pictures show bright colors; however, I mainly received dark colors. The quality could be a lot better.",2
B07FFM3DPB,Fun crafting product. Many different colors.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"I purchased these to make pompom shooters for my kids. They will definitely work for what I ordered them for.That said, they are not the best quality. Honestly, the pompoms I bought at the dollar store were better quality.The google eyes that are included are perfect and we will definitely be using them for crafts.",4
B07FFM3DPB,I just know the quantity because I need 200 pompoms. black came only 8.,3
B07FFM3DPB,Nice for a pompon relay race with tongs.,5
B07FFM3DPB,I purchased these to use for crafts with my kids. I liked that all the Pom poms were the same size. There was a good variety of colors. My girls liked that they came with little eyes.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Have ordered 5 packages of these. White, brown, and multi. Love em",5
B07FFM3DPB,"These pompoms are great entertainment at my house!  From crafts, to sorting, to being used as cereal in dramatic play, we are never disappointed!",5
B07FFM3DPB,me imagine el producto mas grande,4
B07FFM3DPB,Nice colors and great for crafting,5
B07FFM3DPB,These are shown coming in a bag but when they arrived they were crammed into a jar that wasn't large enough. So they are all squished up and not round and fluffy.,3
B07FFM3DPB,Bought these to make a Pom Pom color sort game for my toddler. Super cheap easy game to set up and replayable! When we get tired of that we can use them for crafting later.,5
B07FFM3DPB,Like,5
B07FFM3DPB,Did not buy these for crafting. Bought them for a toddler that likes to drop things into cups and stuff. We do all sorts of things with these. He likes these more than actual toys,4
B07FFM3DPB,"Perfect for crafts. Great size and colors. These are denser than some other pom poms that I've bought in stores which I like as they are easier for a toddler to grip and seem to be more secure when glued due to the increased density.  The only negative (which wasn't an issue for my needs) is that they can pile.  I pulled off a bit of hot glue and doing so left a little ""snag"" that I had to trim off. Not a deal breaker for me.",4
B07FFM3DPB,"Although the quality of this product was nice, the size and portions are not accurate. This is definitely not worth $8",3
B07FFM3DPB,It came in a bottle not in a bag,5
B07FFM3DPB,Very good for my art project,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Find them everywhere. Cheaper than cat toys and keeps cat entertained. Depending on your cat, would recommend watching them so they don't swallow anything, my cat doesn't, but I can see other pets doing so.",5
B07FFM3DPB,"They felt a little cheap, but definitely, you get what you pay for.",3
B07FFM3DPB,"I've used these for my artwork, and I got beautiful results. Perfect for creating trees and landscapes.",5
B07FFM3DPB,Multiple uses and great value for money. I usually keep a handful in the diaper bag in some Tupperware as sorting them keeps my 20month old amused for a while,5
B07FFM3DPB,To give my toddler utter happiness in playing with fuzzy colorful tiny balls of joy I continue to sacrifice the cleanliness of my house and continue the wear and tear of my back to get down on the floor and pick these up. Toddler loves them. In all seriousness great for many activities from sensory. To colors. To counting. To sorting. Solid purchase. They are like glitter though. You will find Pom poms amongst the house for years to come.,5
B07FFM3DPB,I work in a preschool. Kids really love the bright colors of the poms. And the googly eyes are a bonus!,5
B07FFM3DPB,They were all different sizes and the container had a weird tape ball in the center of the container.,1
B07FFM3DPB,In a nice container and you can see the colors you want,5
B07FFM3DPB,Perfect for making a poster project for my daughter!,5
B07FFM3DPB,"I sorted and counted these pom poms so you'd get a sense of the variety and distribution of colors. In total my bag had 301 pom poms in 20 different colors, ranging from 10 to 24 pom poms per shade of color. I'm using them for kids crafts so that's fine with me, but if you're looking for an even distribution, this is not it.",5
B07FFM3DPB,They are not smooth and puffy. They lack volume,1
B07FFM3DPB,Good value. It comes with googly eyes.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Bought these for my pompom obsessed cat, but these were much smaller than pictures made them seem. Frankly don't want to deal with the hassle of returning so I guess they'll be donated somewhere for kid crafts",3
B07FFM3DPB,"Dense, fun, colorful, perfect for crafts and sensory play.",5
B07FFM3DPB,"We bought these for our toddler to play with (while carefully supervised) and she loves them! It's such a simple thing, obviously, but the imagination makes them all kinds of fun.The only downside is that our order took a ridiculously long time to arrive. If a timely delivery is important, this may not be the product for you, but if time isn't an issue, these are great and reasonably priced.",5
B07FFM3DPB,Item purchased & confirmed was to contain 200 color puffs & 100 Googlie eyes.  Gave this item as a gift and no eyes were in the sealed packet.  HELP,3
B07FFM3DPB,My students will use these to make music notes safely and I think they will enjoy it.,5
B07FFM3DPB,A lot for the money,5
B07FFM3DPB,Great craft item. Arrived early and just as described.,5
B07FFM3DPB,This was a project that was done by my dad he was 98 years old and he loved all the beautiful colors it made him very happy.Sadly he passed away 6/3/22,5
B07FFM3DPB,The product was exactly what I expected!,5
B07FFM3DPB,It was fun for the kids,5
B07FFM3DPB,My granddaughter enjoyed playing with the Pom poms,5
B07FFM3DPB,Perfect size,5
B07FFM3DPB,Exactly what I was hoping for. Good quality and colors.,5
B07FFM3DPB,Ordered these for a school project for my daughter. They worked perfectly.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"These pom poms feel terrible to me. I got them for my kids' for a sensor bin, and they just aren't as soft and nice feeling as other ones I've gotten. They'll be fine for crafts, but not great for a sensory bin in my opinion.",3
B07FFM3DPB,My grand daughter loves them,5
B07FFM3DPB,"These are the perfect size!! My kids enjoy color sorting and we like to make container with the colors, and sort the pom poms out. We also like to throw these into the bathtub for some water play!",5
B07FFM3DPB,They are very firm and easy to handle. Beautiful colors and my sign turned out amazing.,5
B07FFM3DPB,I got these to do crafts with my grandchildren. They are wonderful. Very well made. Wonderful colors. Easy for preschoolers to manipulate. Highly recommend for many of the projects for preschoolers shown on Youtube.,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Different colors and packaging than pictured. Quality is good, though",3
B07FFM3DPB,Perfect for kids craft,5
B07FFM3DPB,"Mostly blue and purple color, black  - was hoping for more red, yellow, pink",1
B07FFM3DPB,Got this for my Glider's ball pit. He enjoys burying himself into the pit and playing with the fluffy balls.I recommended washing the balls in a washer/dryer safe bag as they smelled some from the packaging. After the wash they smelled just fine and they were softer.,5
B07FFM3DPB,A craft project!,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I bought two of these and used them to attach a power strip to the inside wall of my desk where my chair goes.  I have a bunch of things plugged in, including my computer, makeup mirror, personal fan, phone, etc.  These sticky nails were easy to install, easy to remove (when I had to redo one to reposition it), and they seem to be sticking really well.  Each one holds up to 5 pounds, so that was more than enough for holding up a full-loaded power strip.  I first placed one with the nail peg at the bottom, and one the opposite way with the nail peg at the top.  That didn't work because of the shape of the back of my power strip.  Instead of making the thing more stable as intended, it made it unstable.  The power strip would slip off the pegs when I pushed a plug into it.  Installing both sticky nail strips in the same direction solved that problem, and it's still sticking really tight after a week.  I have used 3M sticky hooks for other things and they always last until I deliberately take them down.  Removing them is always easy.  I love these things!  I have my device cords all out of the way of my feet but within easy reach for plugging and unplugging.  Annoying situation SOLVED.  And no damage to my desk.  :D",5
B00OFNM2TU,"Used to hang a large painting, works like a charm as long as you follow the instructions provided. Since these are so wide, I applied two command strips side by side on the back of it.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"These are my favorite picture hangers for apartment walls - they mimic a nail head, and stay secure with heavier frames, too.",5
B00OFNM2TU,Came as described! Works great.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"This review is for the Command Universal ""Jumbo"" Picture Hanger - basically the double wide one with the round peg which requires TWO strips.1st Downside is that unlike the two-piece ""Hooks"", these Picture Hangers are a single unit.  Attach (two) glue-strips to back of the metal and PRESS.  Stronger hold, but at least twice as hard to remove.2nd Downside is that these items ship with the lesser-quality glue-strips, NOT the ones designed for a higher moisture environment.  When I order these ""Hangers"", I pretty much dispose of the glue-strips that ship with them, and instead order-and-use the ones designed for higher humidity.3rd Downside is that having TWO of these glue-strips close together means that removing them will be that much harder with more force being exerted on the fragile wall (paint).  Depending on what kind of paint was used and how it was applied, you will either Luck Out or have some Patch Work to do.  I heard once that Flat Paint may have been the Most Friendly, but there's always a risk.  I have tried to use these only on non-painted surfaces (or flat paint) and have had pretty good luck.  When used with glossier paint...  ....Patch Time!Also never expected whatever Laboratory Conditions used to come up with the 8LB figure to function on my planet.  If using something which is HEAVY, will double up the hooks.  If they say it holds 8Lbs, will assume 4 tops.  Have seen various types of hooks hold All Day Long, but when one interacts with the object on the hook, it can act like a lever and apply significant force.  Eventually it may pop off the wall.  Just like flexing a credit card - it's rigid till it snaps.That being said.  Using this item (within limits) works quite well.  Just had an issue where a piece of Annoying Plastic Equipment had to be mounted in an enclosed confined space where drilling into the walls was either Not Recommended or...  A Pillar.  Plenty of Objects already present, so attached ""Hangers"" to Objects and the Annoying Plastic Equipment was off the floor and out of the way in moments.  Equipment even had holes on the back which fit the Pegs on the ""Hangers"" perfectly!  BUT, the Equipment also comes with an (optional) Something which is 12x12 inches and weighs around six pounds.  Would use at least two hooks for that, and would still try to find a way to support some of that weight from below.  Still, it worked GREAT, and I immediately ordered some more ""Hangers"" (and the Higher Humidity Strips) to have these on hand for Future Use.FYI:  Have been using Command products for many years, and the only ???? Issue which I've ever seen is the Strange Design Flaw many Command hooks have.  On the back of one's ""hook"" near the bottom/center is a Sharp Point.  When one ""slides"" the hook up and down on the wall, the Sharp Point does what Sharp Points do and gouges up the wall.  Thankfully not all Command products include the Sharp Point, but it's usually pretty easy to spot - look at the bottom/rear of the hook, and if you see Something Sticking Out - oops!  If it's Perfectly Smooth - no worries.  Thankfully these ""Hangers"" do not need to ""slide"" up and down the wall, so there isn't an issue.",4
B00OFNM2TU,Found these in a store one day and I have fell love with them! Perfect for pictures that weigh 8 pounds or less and you just tired of asking your husband to hang something!! Easy set up and hanging pictures on walls.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Holds heavy pictures. Strong. Discreet. Doesn't make holes on the wall. I rent and can't use nails to hang pictures. Perfect for my needs,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I like these for my canvases bc they have back coverings on them, so the canvas hooks wont work. The only thing thats crappy is these 8lb ones dont come with stabalizer strips so i have to buy them seperate..... yet the 5lb ones come with them, and are $4 cheaper for the set of 3",4
B00OFNM2TU,Followed the directions.. has had a wood framed picture (under the max weight stated) hanging on it a few weeks now with no issue so far.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I needed picture hangers for two oil paintings I have. I live in a park model trailer and the walls are really too thin to hang a picture any other way. I was a bit skeptical at first, but the paintings have been up for about a week now and the hangars haven't budged.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I have been using these rather than putting on nails to hang some pictures, and they work so nicely.  I am really pleased with the results.  It is so great that I don't have to put any holes in the wall.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"Love these command hook, I use them to mount anything and everything to my walls saving me a lot of unnecessary holes.",5
B00OFNM2TU,And it comes off very easily reducing fees for damage walls,4
B00OFNM2TU,"The instructions are clear and the product adheres well.  The only issue I had was in the design.  The protrusion that the picture hands on is on the bottom of the metal piece, which makes sense because the weight is spread throughout the adhesive strips.  However, when trying to hand a picture with a top frame mounted hook, the top of the metal piece is visible above the frame.  Turing the metal piece around is not advisable, since it was designed to be at the bottom.  So, these are only usable for frames with a center hook, and most likely a wire on the center of the frame back.",4
B00OFNM2TU,"Perfect! Trial done with applying and removal, no marks on the wall. Now the pictures have been up for over a week. Will buy again!",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I hung a clock with one of these years ago -- I mean like 15 years ago! When I finally moved, the Command Strip came off the wall without leaving any residue. Now I'm in a new house, and I intend to use Command Strips to hang as many things as I can. The strips sure beat patching holes and painting! I just ordered a package of these because I needed to hang a water de-scaler in a spot where it would have been awkward to use screws. I used the old hanger to check that this particular hanger was a good size. It was perfect! I have to say, I really like the idea of being able to hang things without putting holes in my nice new walls!",5
B00OFNM2TU,I have seen these but figured wouldnt workwell let me tell you they are awesome!I used two for large pictures wood and glass framesthey hold up beautifully.,5
B00OFNM2TU,I use these All the time.  Best way to hang pictures.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Not exactly as we were expecting but does the job,3
B00OFNM2TU,Working as described for my large artwork! They have not failed me yet !,5
B00OFNM2TU,Super simple (just follow the instructions fully) and save your walls from damage. Worked great!,5
B00OFNM2TU,Easy instructions. Holds up a heavy board with no problem.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Nice to hang items on wall and easy to take off.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Big picture (slightly bigger than recommended) but waited a day hung it on the wall weeks ago. Looks like a good product,5
B00OFNM2TU,"Finally, something to mount all the frames without resorting to permenant hardware.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"These command picture hangers are great when you need to hang something and not leave any damage. I used these on the end of my kitchen cabinets for some lightweight decor, and they worked perfectly. I plan to use one on the end of some large bookcases as well. These are good for pictures with sawtooth hangers and could also work for other types of hangers. Just test these first before installing them on your surface since you have a limited number of ties with the adhesive. The frame stabilizers are a great added bonus.",5
B00OFNM2TU,works well,5
B00OFNM2TU,I used 2 of these hangers to hang a 20lb mirror with a wood frame. A few months later and they're working great. I've bumped the mirror a bunch of times and everything's staying put.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I recently had the exterior of my house painted and I needed something to hang a medium weight metal planter (for fake plants) in my covered and screened in patio.  The planter has 2 of those hangers that have a large round hole that leads into a small slit for nail heads.  Because the intended location may not be the permanent location, I used 2 of these metal hangers, and 3 Command strips for 16 pounds, to hang the planter.  2 strips for hanging and 1 strip for support along the bottom of the planter, as a just in case.  Voila!  No holes in my house and I can move it if/when needed.  I will definitely be using more, as time goes on.",5
B00OFNM2TU,great product,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I have been using command strips for years as I have consistently rented my homes and did not like the idea of fixing holes or paying security fees. I have a collection of some nice pieces, and due to often having success with these I did not blink an eye at putting a few up with these jumbo hooks. Had this piece up for about a year, and this evening I came home to find glass everywhere, print damaged, and the paint on the wall was not damaged. Typically one could assume that on painted drywall the paint would be the weak point, but it appears that the strip lost contact with the metal of the hanger itself.The strip and hanger were installed correctly, and the weight of the print and frame was well under what these are advertised for.Now I have a damaged print on my hands that put me out a good bit of money, and I also need to get it reframed.If you are looking to use these with thrift store finds or inexpensive art that is not terribly valuable I would go right ahead as they mostly have caused me no trouble, but if you have something valuable or sentimentally important to hang up I would avoid the worry and use a nailed in wall hanger.",2
B00OFNM2TU,"Enough can't be said about the brand command strips. I've been using these for years and have quite a few around the house that I absolutely love. This one is being added right along with that. I love that this comes with 3 picture holders and both adhesion pads as well as velcro holders. I only needed one but quickly found uses for the other ones. Especially the velcro holders. I used in particular in the picture above one of the picture holders, 1 adhesion strip and 2 velcro pieces at the bottom. I put the adhesion strip on with the picture holder first on the wall by itself and allowed it to sit for the recommended hour I then added the velco pieces to the frame and stuck those alone with the frame all together. Have had no problems. I also used the extra velcro pieces for the back of my remotes to stick to the tv which is a fantasic way of keeping track of them and them being out of the way. Overall I am a huge fan of command and highly recommend this brand.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I've wanted to put art on my walls for so long but was terrified of drilling holes. I've used other command hook styles in the past and didn't even know they made command frame hangers until recently. Best decision ever. They are a game changer. If you don't want to drill holes in your walls, this is the item to buy.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I have tried the plastic version of these (white ones with a ""tooth"" design hook), and both perform really well though these metal ones I have bought multiple times. None of the wall art that is currently using these metal frame hangers have fallen of the wall (yet), and its been almost a year since I applied them to my walls. They hold my picture frames/wall art with such grace and stability, and for the most part they do not stick out from the wall that would make them an eyesore. Great product!",5
B00OFNM2TU,These command strip picture hangers are excellent!  I have used them multiple times around the house instead of putting holes in the wall. They are very easy to use and very sturdy.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Hung a large clock,5
B00OFNM2TU,"Worked at advertized for hanging picture with keyhole slot. Head sticks out enough for 3/16"" deep slot.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"installed 3 frames the same way, 2 held up and one fell, re-installed and the third holds now...not sure what the difference was, maybe curing time for the adhesive?",4
B00OFNM2TU,I've hung up large paintings and frames with these command strip hangers. I currently have 4 items using the heavy duty hooks.  I've had a framed wooden board that weighed 11lbs which the limit of the hanger is 8lbs. So I just used two and it's been hanging up for a month so far (wire backing)Make sure to read instructions. Clean your walls before and if you're using a wire backed frame make sure the nail bit is at the bottom and not the top.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"Strong hold, easy to install, up about 3 weeks and so far no problems",5
B00OFNM2TU,"These Command picture frame hangers are great for minimizing the amount of wall damage I need to repair before moving (which I typically do every one or two years). I also no longer take the time to measure before hanging picture frames like I previously did with hooks that damage the drywall. It's much faster and easier for me to eyeball the position on the wall and remove/adjust when necessary.I've only had these fail once when I didn't take the time to properly clean the wall before applying. I assumed it was unnecessary because the wall did not appear to be dirty or dusty, but I've had no issue after wiping the surface with rubbing alcohol and reapplying.Occasionally they do tear the drywall outer-paper layer upon removal, so it's not a perfect solution. But, I suspect this has more to do with the quality of the drywall than the adhesive properties of the Command strips.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I have multiple sets of these, using them for multiple pieces of artwork that use a wire hanging method. These are perfect. The adhesive is strong and will last a long time.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I have always had a problem with command strips, even though I let them on for an hour before placing the canvas on the hooks. I still think nails are the way to go but since my apartment requires these, I bought them to hang a three piece canvas painting.  The set comes with 3 canvas hooks and extra adhesion strips.  One of the hooks did not adhere properly and left one painting on the floor and the paint pulled off of The wall. However, I did not use rubbing alcohol like the package suggested, so maybe for those of you who do, you might have better results.  After hanging the canvas again and letting the hook adhere for a few more hours than recommended before hanging, it seems to be holding the canvas much better.",4
B00OFNM2TU,"living in a place where you aren't allowed to put holes in the walls but have a bunch of movie posters I want to hang is a challenge. Being an adult, I have poster frames for my movie posters. But when I moved to a place where I wasn't allowed to use hangers that went into the wall I first got the Velcro style frame hangers (still 3m command brand), but the frames kept falling down because the backs of poster frames are made of basically cardboard and the cardboard ripped leaving the hangers still on the wall. I finally found these & they work much better. Poster frames have metal hangars that work great with these.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I used this to hold up a large, but very light-weight, frame with poster. Despite following all installation instructions and the total weight of the frame being about a quarter of the max weight of the adhesion strips advertised, the adhesion disconnected from the wall less than a year later. As a result, the corner of the frame that hit the floor is now shattered.I have two other pictures hung up with these hooks that are still holding strong. Although they are slightly higher in weight compared to the large frame that fell, they are much smaller in dimension. So if you are planning to use these hooks, dimensions appear to be a bigger factor in functionality than the weight advertised.",3
B00OFNM2TU,Exactly what i was looking for. Holds up my art work like I want it.no problem.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I have been using 3M products for a long time for various uses in order not to mess up walls, both in my home and at work.  I love the new universal hanger.  It is just what I need to hang anything in my new home office without damaging the paint.  There are so many different 3M products made just for what you need.  If it isn't working for you, it is probably because you installed it incorrectly or sometimes the product could be old in the package and the adhesive is not as good as it should be.  I have only had an issue once where I used a package I had saved for over a year.  The adhesive dried out, which is totally understandable.  Overall, these things WORK and work well!",5
B00OFNM2TU,"Just moved in to a new house and did not want to put holes in the walls.  Never used these before but decided to try them.  They work!  Hung all the pictures, from small to large, using the correct size Command Strip for each picture.  Also,  they are forgiving in case your measurement was not exact and you need to reposition the hook.  Or someone changes their mind where they want the picture at.Update:  These are not friendly to textured walls.  In the first year I have had two pictures fall because the hanger failed.  One picture weighed about 5 lbs and the other under 4 lbs.  Both were on textured walls.  Will end up with holes after all but will try the 3M Claw hangers to minimize the holes.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"All of the pictures I used these with fell unfortunately. Even the ones that were very light weight, after cleaning the wall per instructions, and applying per instructions. I used them on nontextured walls. Otherwise I usually I have good experiences with command strip items and will keep getting them but these ones didn't work for me",3
B00OFNM2TU,"I purchased a massive amount of different types of command strips in the first part of 2019.  We were painting the inside of our old house to sell it.  I wanted to put things back up on the wall so there were no holes when I took them down.We moved to our new house in July 2019.  I used Command Strips on almost everything that went on the wall except for the very heaviest things.  My walls have a texture but it is mostly flat so I did my best to make sure the Strips were placed where they would have a flat surface.  I also wiped down the walls with alcohol per the instructions.  3M says they are only for use on flat surfaces.  Good grief!  Where does any house have a completely flat surface other than on cabinets?Anyway, I overestimated the weight of everything and used bigger Command Strips and put a Strip on every corner of everything, except for the hooks.  In October 2020 my things began falling off the walls.  I wrote to 3M and, basically, it was my fault for using them on textured walls.  I proceeded to screw and nail up my wall decor.  However, I had a temporary, light-weight decoration to hang so I peeled a Command Strip and found it had no more adhesive whatsoever!  I pulled out a different size and it was the same thing!  I started checking them all and most of them had no more adhesive!  No wonder my things were falling!There's no expiration date on them so should they poop out like that?  I don't think so.  I wrote back to 3M saying I no longer wanted to use their product and wanted to send everything I had left to them so they could send me a refund.  They sent me a label so I'm returning everything!By the way, I kept them inside the house so they weren't exposed to sunlight or temperature extremes.",1
B00OFNM2TU,My wife was skeptical that this would not work and I didn't listen. I hung a piece of art that is expensive but weighs less than have of what these claim to hold. I prepped the surface exactly as described in the instructions.  The art was fine for about 3 hours and then one side let loose from the wall. A very expensive painting came swinging down off the wall. Luckily I was sitting right there and jumped up but not before it smashed into a brand new lamp throwing the glass lamp to the ground and breaking it.  A very expensive lesson,2
B00OFNM2TU,"I love 3M hooks for apartment hanging. Like others have posted, I follow the instructions carefully, clean the wall with alcohol, and wait the time stated or more before using the hooks, and I've never had an issue.For these nail hangers - make sure you are getting the style you want. The current product listing has a ""Medium"" size and ""Large"" size, but in addition to the number of pounds the package states it can hold (5lb vs 8lb) there is also a difference in how you're supposed to place them.The Medium is actually the ""Sawtooth"" type, which is designed to have the nail at the top of the metal plate (this means most of the metal plate is below the nail, which you need if the hook is at the top of your frame.) The Large is the ""Wire-back hanger"" type, which is designed to have the nail at the bottom (this means the metal plate might stick out above your picture if the frame hook is at the top.)",5
B00OFNM2TU,On time and As advertised,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I gave it 4 stars because the packaging was misleading. It said for 8 pounds and yet the card that came with it said 3 pounds. I had to do more research to make sure it was indeed 8 pounds and not 3 pounds and so far it is holding my big painting (12 pounds, I used 2 of them) without any problem. I love these command strips because they really hold everything well without my having to put holes in the wall.",4
B00OFNM2TU,"I find that the recommended weight limits for these hooks are too optimistic.Recently I used a Command hook with an 8-lb weight limit to hang a picture that weighed 7 lb, 2 oz. I followed the instructions scrupulously. To make sure the hook was stably glued to the wall, I even waited 24 hours before cautiously hanging my picture.Overnight everything seemed good. The following morning, however, the picture fell off the wall onto the floor, taking the hook with it.Only consolation: as advertised, there was no damage whatsoever to the wall!",3
B00OFNM2TU,These never fail!!! So easy to use!,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I am not a fan of hanging pictures.  I hate putting a hole in the wall to then find out the picture is too high or off center.  These are great as I can avoid putting holes in the wall and get the desired hanging strength from just one anchor point.  I hung about 10 pictures in a matter of a few hours, I allowed 1 hour from applying command strip hanger to hanging picture, and my wife was so happy.  We totally changed the look of our home and put up some great pictures of our kids that we had sitting in frames waiting to be hung.  I am really happy too because when we want to change things up we can remove without having nail holes that need to be filled and painted.  Really simple to use.",5
B00OFNM2TU,To date all my pictures that I have hung up have NOT fallen at all. Unfortunately I had to move from the house i was in and into another one. So all my pictures on the wall had been up for at least 2 years. To my surprise all of them came off and no paint was removed after all that time. Which also meant no holes in the  walls to fill and paint saved me money. Thank you for this great product.,4
B00OFNM2TU,"We went to hang art in our new house and these allowed us to limit the nail holes in the walls. If we decided to move something, no problem an no patch work.",5
B00OFNM2TU,The packaging includes directions for a variety of command products. It's poorly designed and I had no idea it was for multiple products. It had my head spinning.,4
B00OFNM2TU,"easy to install and hold tight enough for medium to little heavy objects such as clocks, frames and mirrors.I live in rent house and this hanger helps a lot. not damages for the wall and I don't have to worry about cleaning/fix if I have to move-out. I highly recommend!",5
B00OFNM2TU,"Followed the instruction attached and it works pretty well, is able to hold a heavy framed picture with no prob :)",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I am fickle. I like moving things around. The old days of the hammer and nail and subsequent holes in the wall were the only thing stopping me from moving things around as much as I would have liked. I no longer have this problem using Command hanging products. These frame hangers are life savers and you should absolutely get these without worry. I have so many things hanging in my home using command strips. Even my bathroom mirror is hanging using command strips. Not this hanger in particular, but I wanted to give an example of how confident I am in Command strips ability to hold just about anything (as long as you get the correct tool for what you are trying to hang).",5
B00OFNM2TU,I love these. Have repurchased multiple times and in different sizes. They're the only thing ill use to hang my frames.I ran out of the command strips that came in the original package with the hooks (product of moving apartments too many times). Can someone link or direct me to the appropriate strip refill pack? Im not sure if the normal strips can be substituted here.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"Command products helped save my marriage.  I like to hang things on the wall and my husband stinks at hanging things on the wall.  It doesn't matter what kind of level or other tools he uses, he can't hang these centered or even.  Now, instead of dreading the wall repair I would have to eventually do because of all the extra ""wrong"" holes he would put in the wall, I can use these and the biggest issue is getting a few extra adhesive strips to use in case we need to move things around. I used these for larger poster frames and only had to use one per frame.  The hangers have been up for almost a year with no problems.  I love all the Command products I have used and plan to keep on using them.  The ones I have had to remove or move have left no marks at all on the walls. Awesome product!",5
B00OFNM2TU,Product works well just make sure you read the instructions properly,4
B00OFNM2TU,"The perfect hangers. I strictly follow the rules of cleaning any wall with an alcohol pad before mounting the hangers. If the canvas is heavy, i actually wait 24 hours before putting weight on the hanger. I love and trust the jumbo ones that take two strips per hanger. Days and weeks and no sign of the hangers to losen. Very much recommend if the price is in your range. I also tried the other hangers of the commander series and all are working flawlessly. Do mind the many cheap counterfeits from  China and stick with M3!",5
B00OFNM2TU,I have several of these in use and absolutely love them. They go on easy hold a bunch of weight and come off with no damage. I wish I had seen them earlier so I could avoid nails. These also work great on wallpapered walls. My only suggestion is to use the metal ones over the plastic version.,5
B00OFNM2TU,We used these hooks to hang a basket in our RV. They work great. We fill the basket with books and the hooks have stayed up in the heat of the RV and while being jostled while we drive.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"These sticky nails work so much better than the sticky tape you put on the sides of the frame. They are more sturdy.  There are some reviews that say things fell, thats only becuz they didnt follow instructions carefully. You need to wipe the area with rubbing alcohol first, let dry, position the sticky nail making sure the long side is hidden behind the frame and not peaking up over the frame. Then you press and hold it on wall for 30 seconds, then be patient and let it stay on the wall 24 hrs, before hanging picture. Simple, and it works so well! Love these command sticky nails, plus you dont see it on the sides like u do with just the sticky tape alone.",5
B00OFNM2TU,"I like this particular Command product for hanging pictures as it will accommodate several types of hangers.  I was having trouble finding a Command product for sawtooth hangers that mount to the picture frame itself..  I could find them for the circle type hangers mounted to the backing but not the other.  This product is really versatile.  You can use it for sawtooth hangers, circle type hangers and wire hangers as well as with  slots in wall hangings such as tiles, etc.  No more looking for 2 or 3 different hangers.",5
B00OFNM2TU,I don't like drilling holes. I know this product cannot hold heavy stuffs. So I just stick with the weight limit when I'm considering a purchase. Worked great!,5
B00OFNM2TU,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is perfect to hang artwork or photos on your walls without drilling a screw into it or hammering a nail. Easy to install. Easy to remove.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Has to be very light.,3
B00OFNM2TU,Well designed way to hang a picture with a wire hanger.  Sturdy and stays up.  Great product.,5
B00OFNM2TU,Use these to hold Christmas picture from Hobby Lobby and no problems.,5
B00OFNM2TU,"I live in a historical building where the walls can't be disturbed. These got me out of a bind with all of my picture frames that only have a notch to hang from a nail or screw. I have not tried them for heavier pictures, but they were just right for my small frames. Easy to install, simple instructions, and they do come with extra small stabilizer strips for larger pieces (which I used with other command hooks as the small frames don't need them).",5
B005IZLXPI,nice and strong,5
B005IZLXPI,"I bought this ruler for my basic projects, it was cheap and I didn't expect much. I wanted a wooden ruler as I expected it would be easier to read than a plastic, colored ruler. It is. I was a little worried that it would be a little bumpy as you tried to draw a straight line along the edge, its not, its smooth and gets the job done.",5
B005IZLXPI,"I know that it's kinda silly to write a review for a ruler, right?? Cause really, what can you say?Well if you are like me and have been stuck using a really awful, flimsy, plastic ruler for the last few years - believe me you can think of a lot to say about a ruler!!First thing, the brand. It's a very trustworthy company, so that right there tells you that you are getting a quality product. As for the ruler itself, I could not be happier. It is very lightweight. All of the markings are very clear to see. I have no problem seeing them even without my glasses on. It's just a great quality ruler, hands down.The last wooden one I had years ago was very heavy and had a thin metal piece along the top of it that always ended up cutting my fingers somehow. With this one, you have a clear piece of plastic that is not going to harm you whatsoever.So I highly recommend this ruler to anyone who needs one. It's the best I've had to my life!",5
B005IZLXPI,Y'know what I used this for...,5
B005IZLXPI,"measures well, sturdy, good product",5
B005IZLXPI,Great for school,4
B005IZLXPI,"I bought this ruler for some basic home projects, and overall, it does the job well. The measurements are accurate, and the metal edge adds some sturdiness, which is helpful for straight lines when cutting. However, after just a few uses, I noticed the printed numbers and markings started to fade, especially on the parts I use frequently. It's lightweight and easy to store, which is a plus. If you're using it for light tasks, it works fine, but for heavy use, the fading issue might be frustrating!",4
B005IZLXPI,This ruler is a good size ruler for crafts which is why I got it. Thanks!,4
B005IZLXPI,Nothing more or less than what I expected.,5
B005IZLXPI,Does the job,4
B005IZLXPI,"The Wood Ruler is of average quality, but considering the low price, it's a good choice for students. It gets the job done for basic tasks, and its affordability makes it a practical option for school use.",4
B005IZLXPI,"I needed a light, simple ruler to mark the rows of my manuscripts, and lo and behold, one lightweight, quality ruler that is better than many I've had!  Recommend",5
B005IZLXPI,I like the natural colour and solid size,4
B005IZLXPI,Good ruler,5
B005IZLXPI,"This ruler is durable and accurate, suitable for various tasks. However, it's lack of non-slip backing sometimes causes it to slide on smooth surfaces, requiring readjustment.",4
B005IZLXPI,The two most important things here are that it was cheap and accurate.,5
B005IZLXPI,Good quality,5
B005IZLXPI,"I used the rulers for their three holes in them as a special education teacher.  I used the sticks for sight word flashcards. Know, working on, new.  Each student had their own stick (ruler).  The rulers are accurate, readable, flexible, sturdy, and lightweight though.",5
B005IZLXPI,I use this for measuring a knitted piece as I progress and need to know how m any inches have been accomplished.,5
B005IZLXPI,Great wooden ruler. Was made very good. Just like one I had purchased at store.,5
B005IZLXPI,Nice ruler. Cheap and does the job just fine. What else is there to say?,5
B005IZLXPI,Nice wooden straight edge wooden ruler. Seems accurate to me!,5
B005IZLXPI,This is a pretty high quality wooden ruler.,5
B005IZLXPI,Good choice to a back to school ruler that is easy to read and is spot on accurate.,5
B005IZLXPI,As expected. It's a ruler what can I say.,5
B005IZLXPI,"Classic ruler, timeless.",5
B005IZLXPI,It's an old fashioned ruler.  Can't screw that up.,5
B005IZLXPI,"Needed for my son's school supplies, best price I could find, it will serve our purposes well. Quality is ok but as expected for the price",5
B005IZLXPI,"No complaints, it's a wood ruler.",5
B005IZLXPI,I had several plastic and metal rulers that faded which make them worthless. This wood ruler has lasted and will continue to last. Sometimes you don't need to reinvent the wheel when the original design is better. I'll never used anything but a wood ruler.,5
B005IZLXPI,Product works as expected and is readable.,5
B005IZLXPI,Nice but extremely thin. Probably will save alot of Catholic kids knuckles,2
B005IZLXPI,Great as pictured. Needed it for my kids as I am teaching them how to measure things. Great buy and great price.,5

B005IZLXPI,Good wooden ruler. Does its job. Lol.,5
B005IZLXPI,The item broke when placed in the child bookbag.,3

B005IZLXPI,This is just your typical wooden ruler.,5
B005IZLXPI,"My kids colored all over my ruler and needed something clean to use when I am taking pictures.  This ruler is clean and easy to read.If you need a really good ruler and one that will not hip the wallet hard, I would suggest this ruler.

B005IZLXPI,"he Fiskars Wood Ruler is a fantastic budget-friendly option that doesn't compromise on quality. I was pleasantly surprised by how well-made and durable it is despite its affordable price. The wood material feels sturdy and substantial, providing a reliable tool for measuring various objects and drawing straight lines.",4
B005IZLXPI,"It's durable, accurate, has one metal edge, my nephews NEVER DRAW WITHOUT IT! Very Highly Recommended!!!",5
B005IZLXPI,"Notice: I got this ruler for $.47, so this is the reason why.Currently of writing this its $4.74 and its a big no no to purchase again.So im writing this review based on how much i paid.The ruler is a good quality ruler that made from wood.It doesn't start measuring at the edge of the ruler as some people may like it.so zero starts about 2 cm from the edge. Some of the color is slightly faded but it is also okay for the price.There is a plastic on the wood ruler when measuring with pencil, it doesn't get on the wood and make it have leadOverall the ruler is great, i was able to measure paper lengths and the height of figures and such.For 47 cents it is also a cheap way to buy replenish your supplies of rulersif it is more than 47cents probably look for other ones",5
B005IZLXPI,Buying this ruler reminded me of my childhood days. A wonderful ruler that will hold up to use day after day. Seller was quick to ship and item was as promised. Excellent Product!,5
B005IZLXPI,BEST RULER EVER  - very clear and easy to read. Hole in one end makes it easy to hang it on the inside of my desk - easy to reach and I WILL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT.  Soft wood - easy to mar. Plastic edge makes it easy for drawing lines.,5
B005IZLXPI,Great for a ruler,5
B005IZLXPI,It's just a ruler. Nothing more nothing less.,5

B005IZLXPI,I just needed another ruller for fabric measuring.  It works fine for my needs.  Also works great for tearing paper.,5
B005IZLXPI,"Update: BEST SEWING RULER, EVER!Just what I wanted, an easy to read ruler. The contrast of the printing against the light wood is wonderful. I love this little rulerA good value for the money and it has the Fiskars quality.",5
B005IZLXPI,Fantastic ruler! Excellent quality. I was not expecting to receive such a wonderful ruler for the price I paid. Now I have a good ruler every time I need one. You don't realize how much you need a ruler until you need to do a measurement and can't because you didn't have a ruler.,5
B005IZLXPI,"When I saw this, I had visions of the solid wooden ruler we had back when I was in school and before most of you were born.  What I received, admittedly for almost nothing, was a shadow of that.The ruler is thin, maybe 1.8"" thick. It weighs next to nothing, about 0.4 ounces, about as heavy as two quarters.The ruler has a transparent plastic edge, back in the day it was brass, to help draw straight lines. Being able to see through it makes it easier to line up when drawing those straight lines.I bought this as a prop for photographs and for that it's okay. It's also OK, I guess, for small kids. However, if you use a ruler frequently for work or crafts, something like the  Officemate 15 inch Stainless Steel Ruler        will probably serve you better. I've been using the Fiskars version for decades and have no complaints other than it doesn't show up well in photographs.",3
B005IZLXPI,nice sturdy hard wooden ruler. Great product as super heavy duty!,5
B005IZLXPI,Wood is best for ruler,5
B005IZLXPI,"this is a useless review but amazon is jamming it down my throat in my email inbox, so yeah. it's a ruler. this baby is packing a WHOPPING 12 inches, A WHOLE 30.4 CENTIMETERS, AND IT'S MADE OF WOOD! its a ruler...it works...",5
B005IZLXPI,Nice works well,5
B005IZLXPI,"don't let your dog get it or they'll chew it and split it like a stick, lol. unbeatable price!",5
B005IZLXPI,"Nice wooden ruler. Seems sturdy enough to withstand serious manhandling from my elementary schooler. So I call that a win, especially for the price.",5
B005IZLXPI,Bought several of these to use in our homeschool. Was tired of the numbers wearing off of the plastic rulers. These are nice old school quality and we have no trouble seeing the marks and numbers. Hoping they will last quite a while.,5
B005IZLXPI,", Good price. Helps a lot with school work.",5
B005IZLXPI,Works great!,5
B005IZLXPI,"Does the job, cheap",5
B005IZLXPI,Certainly can't argue about the price.  My gripe is that the ruler's first marking (indicating the zero point) is about 1/4 inch from the start of the ruler which can be an issue if you want to get the zero point at the beginning of the item you are measuring.  I taught math for many years and have never seen a ruler not start at zero.,3
B005IZLXPI,Good quality.  Will use for crafting.,3
B005IZLXPI,I got this because I was about this amount awsy from free shipping. My 5 year old likes to measure everyone with it.  He said I was big. Like a hippo.  Not my favorite compliment. Pretty sturdy ruler,5
B005IZLXPI,Not much you can say about a ruler. This one is worth it's admission price. The plastic edge is nice for drawing straight lines. I must say the ruler is must lighter than other ones I've owned. Feels like balsa wood. So it'll be no good when used to strike people.,5
B005IZLXPI,"A nice, simple, sturdy, straight ruler.",5
B005IZLXPI,I like this ruler.,5
B005IZLXPI,"didn't know they still made these wooden rulers, takes me back to grade school 60 yrs ago!  I keep it right by my computer - so handy when shopping amazon to check the given measurements on all kindsa stuff.",5
B005IZLXPI,"My only complaint with this ruler is that the plastic straight edge is not straight. Can't complain too much for the cost, though!",4
B005IZLXPI,NOW I CAN MEASURE IT,5
B005IZLXPI,It came broken and isnt worth the effort to return it.,1
B005IZLXPI,"Man...what a difference this ruler makes when measuring. I was using my thumb and forefingers and found them to be highly inacurate. This gives me the ability to lay it across a distance and see the difference between numbers and them, bam...there's your measurement. It even came with a nifty hole so you can stick the eraser end of a pencil in it and spin it like a helicopter blade (be careful not to lift the pencil too soon or it could go flying!). Added bonus features are the security metal detector alarm activator and built in table marring edge.",5
B005IZLXPI,Need a ruler? Here you go. Seems accurate,5
B005IZLXPI,It was exactly as described.,5
B005IZLXPI,It should work,5
B005IZLXPI,It works for getting me free shipping on 25 or more,5
B005IZLXPI,its a ruler. could be cheaper but its better then the ones at the dollar store. it wasnt warped and has a good edge. marks don't start at the edge tho.,4
B005IZLXPI,A bit flimsy but it's a ruler  so who cares,5
B005IZLXPI,"What to say? It's a ruler - has a soft metal edge, markings are accurate, works nicely as a straightedge, and will kick your order up over the $25 barrier for free shipping. What's not to like?!?",5
B005IZLXPI,Good ruler strong,4
B005IZLXPI,It measures things.,5
B07YNW3GC2,"Fun mica powders! Can use them for coloring clay, making lipsticks or eyeshadows. Can even use them in nail art! Coloring cosmetics in general work very well with this mica powder. They don't glow, but some of them are neon. They aren't sticky, but they do attach to fabric and is very hard to clean. The bottle's are very small, tho. But that's okay because you only need a little bit to color some things. If you are buying these to color polymer clay, don't expect them to color completely, they will just give a hint of color. Go with a tray of pastel pigments to color polymer clay completely and densely. I used them indoors and they floated all up in the air, so heads up! Using them outside or in a garage would probably be better then in your house.",5
B07YNW3GC2,"Vibrant colors, stains, easy to use, great quality for price, good amount in containers, functional",5
B07YNW3GC2,Pretty colors. The caps weren't tightend all the way causing them to spill onto my daughter's hands. But overall pleased with the colors and application of the product.,4
B07YNW3GC2,"This is my first time doing epoxy resin and after a ton of research I found out that mica powder was what I was looking for. All of the resin that I've done so far turns out really well and looks shiney and pretty. It works really well and gives you exactly what you want. The bottles were actually bigger than I was expecting and although I've used each multiple times I'm not even close to running out. It does take a second of stirring to get it in but other than that it's really easy to use. It was fairly cheap and is really worth it. It also has a variety of colors, more than I would think I would get for that quality and price.",5
B07YNW3GC2,The mica is great coloring for melt and pour soaps.  I have made a few batches using this mica pigment so far and it mixes well.  Very little needed for coloring compared to other micas.,5
B07YNW3GC2,Nice selection of pigments and reasonably priced.,5
B07YNW3GC2,This is an exceptional array of mica powders. Can't wait to try them out!~,5
B07YNW3GC2,I love these Mica powders while making resin coasters. The colors that I've used so far are beautiful! I definitely recommend!,5
B07YNW3GC2,"Nice pigment, am in love",5
B07YNW3GC2,Comes with different colors and they are easy to include in using Epoxy pours.,5
B07YNW3GC2,These really popped,4
B07YNW3GC2,Beautiful colors,5
B07YNW3GC2,"As a candle and spa item creator, I have tried color in many forms. This is absolutely the best color form hands down. Thank you for making them available!",5
B07YNW3GC2,This stuff works the same but better cuz you can create any color you want and soooo affordable,5
B07YNW3GC2,Everything showed up on time and the product was what was advertised.Thank you,5
B07YNW3GC2,Everything is ok with this.,5
B07YNW3GC2,Very nice,5
B07YNW3GC2,Shipped fast & excellent product!,5
B07YNW3GC2,Works will to tint the two part epoxy,5
B07YNW3GC2,very vibrant colours,5
B07YNW3GC2,Every single jar was half open. I had to check all and now my fingers are sparkling.  Each jar had some magic leak out.,4
B07YNW3GC2,"Ordered the autumn colors. My son wanted to make his own fishing lures. So far, the colors that he's used have turned out really well.",5
B07YNW3GC2,Colors worked great,4
B07YNW3GC2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Wow are these amazing, so many beautiful colors, and although a little powder cam out I'm super excited to see what burgundy looks like. Comes with a cute little spoon to scoop with!!",5
B07YNW3GC2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As the packaging states, this is a powdered pigment, so it can be messy. When you open it just use caution that you're opening it in a space where nothing's going to get stained. The containers look little, but the pigment is very strong and a little bit goes a long way.I am very satisfied with this product and would buy it again for the price. Can use for various arts and crafts projects. Beautiful shades!",5
B07YNW3GC2,Will be buying again!,5
B07YNW3GC2,Seem fine for resin. looking forward to using them,5
B07YNW3GC2,"So far the product is OK.  When it arrived, one of the jars of powder had opened slightly in spite of having inner seals.  Made a bit of a mess on the inside of the box.  On further inspection, about  4-5 jars' lids were loose.",4
B07YNW3GC2,"These are great deep pigments. They are beautiful colors, and a good variety of colors. I will happily purchase more in the future",5
B07YNW3GC2,This mica powder works really great when mixing into epoxy resin. It only takes the tiniest amount to get a wonderful color. I don't have much to say beyond that other than...Do not spill this stuff in your carpet. I spilled a full container of copper color pigment and LET ME TELL YOU it's still in the carpet after vacuuming many many times. It's like glitter... spill it and get ready to have a life long guest in your room :),5
B07YNW3GC2,What variety! Can't wait to try multiple combinations. Just getting started with epoxy inlay into my woodworking projects. I used an alcohol based pigment but the color was just too bland. I think these mica based pigments should add more color and opacity to the epoxy. I think that the price is fair and it will let me experiment before purchasing larger quantities of a particular pigment.,5
B07YNW3GC2,Great color pigments. Explaining to wife why you have this all over you not great.,5
B07YNW3GC2,"Mica is vegan which can be added to soaps and candles. I loved the variety of colors and how easy it was to use. Keep in mind that the color will be a slight bit lighter, depending on how much you use on candle wax, once it dries. More colors would be appreciated. I would also prefer the bottles to be a bit bigger. That is the only reason I gave it  4 stars.",4
B07YNW3GC2,Right now we are starting a new business with candles and this ink powder just give us the colors we want!Completely recommended!,5
B07YNW3GC2,Muy rendidor. Excelente paleta de colores,5
B07YNW3GC2,It is wonderful that i have the opportunity,5
B07YNW3GC2,I love the colors alot. The delivery driver was kind and gentle. But the box packer that packed my delivery packed them upside down. Luckily it wasn't out of plastic wrap. But it still is really messy.,4
B07YNW3GC2,Making watercolor paint,5
B07YNW3GC2,"These Packets are small, but that's ok because a little goes a long way. I didn't want to get the larger size until I could see if I liked these pigments. They are beautiful in my resins! There is a wonderful selection of colours and a lot of them. They mix very well in resin and have a beautiful colour when they dry. This is a very good value for your money! I will definitely purchase more and recommend this product. I purchased this and have no affiliation with this company. This is my honest and true opinion.",5
B07YNW3GC2,I used the powder to color and epoxy countertop in my kitchen. All the colors were just what I wanted and the price was so cheap compared to the high quality results. I would recommend to anyone.,5
B07YNW3GC2,"I find the colors great for what I use them for, except the gold and white. The gold had more of a brass tone than a vibrant flashy gold tone but still very gold. The white well let's say that was more  like clear glitter when applied. I Didn't like it at all. It also had a different  texture than the rest more course than fine ground. I think if it was fine ground it would have been usable I still don't have a use for  it because of the texture.",4
B07YNW3GC2,"I'm making Lazy Susans from 12"" wood rounds.  I'm needing to use more of this Mica than of other brands to overcome the transparency, at least for the three colors that I've tried so far.  Most other Mica I have cause it to become opaque much quicker.  But . . . when using enough, it gives a nice appearance.  Or adding a pure colorant along with the does help.  I would not have purchased this Mica for this project if I had known of this ""transparency"" through the product description.",3
B07YNW3GC2,"Package was a bit beat up and looked damaged or open.  Inside the powers were still in there clear plastic wrap.  Upon opening that powder was everywhere.  Most lids were loose, thank goodness the powders were still in their jars.  Looks like most jars were still full, some were not as full.  Could be powder from another open jar or done at manufacturing.",4
B07YNW3GC2,My husband does epoxy and stainless concrete and really liked the colors in this kit and will definitely buy for future clients looking for a similar look.,5
B07YNW3GC2,good buy for what you get vs. price,5
B07YNW3GC2,"Well packed, but wear gloves when opening and using. Very wide range of colors and enough for a deep-pour ocean floor.Colors will be translucent no matter how dark so base layer will still show through. Colors spread and thin while setting and drying on deep pours so go darker than your final project needs.",5
B07YNW3GC2,Great variety of colors -awesome quality for price-love the tiny spoon addition,5
B07YNW3GC2,Worked very well. Not tricky at all to incorporate into the epoxy. Will use again and ads a great dimension To the piece.,5
B07YNW3GC2,Will be ordering larger jars in the future now that I know what colors I like.,5
B07YNW3GC2,Used these to mix with epoxy pours for woodworking and worked great. The colors easily mix into the epoxy and leaves a nice appearance difference throughout. Use the mica powder type unless you want a boring appearance that is solid throughout (think like paint),5
B07YNW3GC2,Tons of colors to choose from. They are beautiful. I am very pleased with this purchase. I have used many of the colors. I will be buying more and trying the other colors/kits as well,5
B07YNW3GC2,Have not used yet plan to enhance wood defects on table Im making !,5
B07YNW3GC2,"Me gustan mucho los colores y el brillo que tienen pero para las velas que hago no, no he podido lograr que el color quede parejo",4
B07YNW3GC2,The colors were perfect for this project.  Had to use the copper and the brass or gold to help ffill some epoxy gaps and with high quality epoxy it turned out Awesome,4
B07YNW3GC2,but the green looks more like gold than green . that's why 4* not 5,4
B07YNW3GC2,Colors mix well and are a gorgeous colors,5
B07YNW3GC2,"I bought this set because I like to highlight areas on greeting cards with a little shimmer. The brand of mica powder I used to use got very pricey so I thought I'd try these. The only problem is that the powder is extremely fine and flies all over when you take the lid off. I don't like breathing in the dust so I stopped using them and checked the web for ideas on what to do with them. I didn't want to mess with resins and molds but I found instructions for making your own shimmer watercolor. It worked great! The videos said to use a heavy glass plate and glass thing you hold in your hand (like the thing in a morter and pestle set) to grind the powder and gum Arabic together, then add distilled water. This mica powder and the gum Arabic was ground so fine I didn't need to grind them together. I used a popsicle stick and a small bowl and had no lumps at all. The paint works great. I painted the raised area on a dry embossed piece of paper then mounted it on a card base. Then I punched out tiny four petal paper flowers and glued a few over the flowers. I used the white shimmer paint to add sparkle to the extra flowers. It looks great! I have lots of powder left for other projects. I wore a mask when I worked with the mica powder because even a small bit in your lungs can cause silicosis.",5
B07YNW3GC2,True to color in pic.,5
B07YNW3GC2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I used it in my candles not realizing it would clog the wicks lol but no better way to learn! Despite that issue, they made my candles sooooo beautiful when they melt!",5
B07YNW3GC2,Epoxy,3
B07YNW3GC2,"I have read that others were disappointed in the packaging. Mine came with full jars and minimal powder within the shipping package, I used it to color the books Ifold. The colors are brilliant.",5
B07YNW3GC2,Love how bright the colors are and a little goes a long way. Easy to add and mixes well with current resin I am using. Will look for another color set for more projects. Will be on a recurring list to reorder in the future.,5
B07YNW3GC2,These beautiful colors were possible because of this product! Making beachy wave coasters,5
B07YNW3GC2,The colors are very pretty. The only thing that bothered me is that there was power everywhere in the package and I had to clean all the jars. I used a white base for my soap so I didn't get the pearl look in mine. I will get clear and try it out too,4
B07YNW3GC2,Mixed well with resin and gave good colors.,5
B07YNW3GC2,So many nice colors to chose from!,5
B07YNW3GC2,Worked out really well for my application.,5
B07YNW3GC2,The powder mixed very well with the pearl wax. I would definitely buy again.,5
B07YNW3GC2,I liked the variety of colorants in this kit. Seems like a decent quantity of each one. Fast shipping and decent price,5
B07YNW3GC2,Worked great with liquid glass deep pour epoxy. Mixed very well. No problems.,5
B07YNW3GC2,Pretty color pallet combination and possibilities. Keep cheap my color variant methodology.,5
B07YNW3GC2,as described,5
B07YNW3GC2,use to color soap,5
B07YNW3GC2,I Love Them,5
B07YNW3GC2,This color collection is great . Easy to use .,5
B07YNW3GC2,"I decided to make soap for my Christmas gifts this year, and this mica set worked perfectly for the idea I had in mind. I just painted the mica powder into a silicon mold and then poured in soap base.I do want to mention that all of the colors were a fine grain mica powder, however the white was very chunky/coarse. You can compare the purple vs the white in the picture. Not a positive or negative in general, just depends on what you want to use it for. Was a positive for me though since the only mica I have other than this set is an extremely fine white so now I have a variety lol. The coarse white in this set worked better to create the snow on my Christmas trees, while the fine white I already had worked better to paint the frosting eyes/mouth/buttons on my gingerbread people.",5
B07YNW3GC2,"The reasons I chose these were: 1. Lots of colors. 2. They came in jars and not little baggies.The good: The colors are beautiful; they blend well, and they are vibrant.The bad: Some of the jars don't open and close properly. I have opened about 10 and so far, 3 are defective. The jar for the purple is so bad I'm going to have to move the powder to a little baggie. I have to fight with it for several minutes to open it and I have to bash the lid down in order to close.This is enough for me not to buy this brand again.",3
B07YNW3GC2,"Green some what metallic look, the gold is also in this design. This is a painting it's satisfying results.Depends on what you want to do with this material you do have to blend it with something you don't have.Clean surfaces cover surfaces while using compound, Once liquid it's ok.You will buy more anyway clear allows the pigment to have its natural effect but use materials that will bind with the surface only add the same material. Don't water to oil to glue. Clean your brushes and dry them out so you don't cross contaminate.CautionNot for children use with adult supervision. PS.First mix in a room with windows or purifier. adults slight movements will cause breathing issues. Measure use, and protect the product don't pour the dust it will pollute the room in seconds",5
B07YNW3GC2,"My first attempt at using Mica powder and resin molds. Im a newbie but I'm hooked. I used a small soft paintbrush (dry) and applied the mica powder on the molds, and poured the resin. This was the result! Gorgeous! The mica powder washes off the molds and your hands easily with basic soap and water. There are so many colors and they are packaged well. The colors are pearlescent, giving just the perfect glow and shimmer. I had no spillage or other issues. So excited to include more color into my molds! Great product!",5
B07YNW3GC2,These give such great colors and are easy to use.,5
B07YNW3GC2,I'm new to using this product. I have been having a lot of fun making all sorts of colors and combinations into my crafts. It's kind of addicting actually. I want to add the color to everything. A little bit of the powder goes a long way. Powder mixes in nicely after some stirring and does not clump or chunk up.,5
B07YNW3GC2,A little bit goes a long way. Excellent colors that can achieve different effects based on concentration and mixing. Particular affinity for the Silver Ash along with the pinks and purples.,5
B07YNW3GC2,"Good size for epoxy projects, only need a scoop or two",5
B07YNW3GC2,"The colors are very bright and vibrant. The bottles are a little smaller than expected but a little goes a long way and they have lasted us a really long time. I bought for my daughter for slime and they are messy, most cleaned up easily but the blue and green did stain my table so beware of using it near furniture.",3
B07YNW3GC2,Colors are great!  The lids were not on tight so I received a very sparkly mess.,4
B07YNW3GC2,Small pots of color but they are vivid and highly pigmented,5
B07YNW3GC2,Great for turning tumblers and crafts,4
B072RV8SC7,"Perfect for my on-the-go junk journaling, it is small enough to fit in my pencil case and is a nice precise cut, very sharp.",5
B072RV8SC7,"I really like these little scissors they do the job I needed something that was quick, strong, sturdy, and sharp for my little crafts that I do around the house. They have worked out well and I would highly recommend them.",5
B072RV8SC7,These are the best. They are comfortable and hardy and boy are they sharp. My only critique is that the screw that holds them together will rust quickly so they must be taken apart and thoroughly dried before putting back together. I usually take a little vinegar to the screw area if it rusts at all and that fixes it.,5
B072RV8SC7,"I use these scissors for many things, sewing, hair bangs, clothing tags, etc.  They are a good smaller pair of scissors and are sharp and cut well.  They are good for light fabric and sewing jobs, but I need a stronger pair for thicker fabrics.  Good product for the price and recommend at this price point.",4
B072RV8SC7,"These are excellent quality for cutting! Even just trimming something, it has a very fine tip, which is nice. Great design.And it is definitely comfortable to use. All of my scissors seem to dull very quickly, but these have stayed true! They are extremely sharp, though, so be careful.",5
B072RV8SC7,"I use these for building paper airplane models. The do a good job of cutting paper accurately. They are a little small for my hands, but they are still usable.",5
B072RV8SC7,Good,4
B072RV8SC7,Nice and sharp also small so easy to pack away nicely,5
B072RV8SC7,"These are nice scissors. I got them to trim my bangs. They won't do that. So I marked off one star. But other than that they work well. They are easy to hold, even with my large hands. They are ok scissors for the price but I've noticed that they have raised the price. I don't think they are worth paying and extra 25%.",4
B072RV8SC7,"After hundreds of uses , still sharp. Worth every penny",5
B072RV8SC7,"I believed the blade size was 5 in., not the entirety of the scissor. So, I was a bit disappointed. They do work  well though, so they get a 4-star rating.",4
B072RV8SC7,"These are very good scissors. They are very sharp so cutting is a breeze. I like them so much that I bought 3 of them. When my office supply junkie husband abscondes with them, as he always does,I will buy them again. Now if the could make a scissor with a security alarm I could stop having to replace them all the time.",5
B072RV8SC7,"These are absolutely perfection for larger hands, and should that be an important factor for you, look no further.  i have purchased three of these many years ago, and I am still using the first one is still daily.  i have Never had to sharpen it yet.  Trust me, you will Never need or desire to purchase any other scissors!  Just save your money and gets these.",5
B072RV8SC7,I was looking for a small pair of scissors and these are just what I wanted.,4
B072RV8SC7,I would never buy any other product!,5
B072RV8SC7,They do the job.,5
B072RV8SC7,Only get these for little children because the holds for the fingers is too small.,3
B072RV8SC7,Good for a multitude of household uses and the right size to keep in a desk drawer or in the magnetic pen/notepad cup on the fridge.  I've always been a big fan of Westcott scissors and have them in all sizes and colors.  Quality products reasonably priced.,5
B072RV8SC7,Great design and good grip.,4
B072RV8SC7,Sturdy little pair of scissors. I bought em for my tackle box thinking they would cut braided line. They kinda do but not a really good clean cut. I'm sure they're good for most anything else.,4
B072RV8SC7,These scissors work great - they even cut through light-weight plastic bags like a breeze.  Don,5
B072RV8SC7,"they are sharp, I bought these for fussy cutting  with  my  decoupage and when I cut with  the tip the blades stick and catch. not pleased, I probably should give it less then 4 stars",4
B072RV8SC7,Nice s issors.,5
B072RV8SC7,"Wonderful - The Westcott crafting scissors are easy to hold and use. They are a small size and fit great in a bag on the go or in a small pencil case. I have purchased them a few times and have given them as gift to people who create arts and crafts or do sewing projects. The quality of the scissors is very nice. The price on Amazon can range from $5.98 to $15.98 for the same scissor. It tends to shoot up and down. If you watch, you can get this scissor for around $6 dollars. That is when I've been able to get a few. While it is worth $15, not everyone has the money to pay fifteen bucks for a pair of scissors. They are very nice quality and I will keep buying them and using them.",5
B072RV8SC7,This scissor is fantastic. Very precise and Sharpe.  I have one very similar one to this one in the past but lost it at the airport. Little expensive but worth the money.,5
B072RV8SC7,I use these scissors to cut and wick my rebuildable tank atomizers and boy do they make accurate cuts. As well are they comfortable to use. The price is unbeatable.,5
B072RV8SC7,"I bought the 5 inch version. It's nice and sleek looking. Plain, simple, sharp, and does a good job cutting. However be aware that the tip is sharp like a knife tip. Be careful using it.",5
B072RV8SC7,"i really like that they are sharp and compact,and priced right as i keep them in my bathroom, and ise them for many different purposes and usualy take them with me when traveling too as i may need to trim some facial hair, but it's just good to have a nice pair of sharp compact scissors with you as you never know when you may need them. if your looking for some scissors that are sharp and compact at a good price point, you found them,now just pick a color and order them.",5
B072RV8SC7,I wanted a small set of scissors to have in my bandage box in order to cut larger non-stick bandages into numerous small ones.  These scissors are perfect.  VERY sharp with perfect control to make those perfect snips!  :-)  Would definitely buy them again.,5
B072RV8SC7,The scissors I purchased was a disappointment for the price that was paid. Due to the structure in materials used on these scissors they not going to last long,3
B072RV8SC7,"I'd been on the hunt for a good pair of small scissors for a while now and I almost gave up only to go to the dollar store!! LOL I'm happy I didn't though!I came across these, looked through some reviews, additional options of scissors and just kept coming back to this one in particular!!!I did purchase while it was ""on sale"" (this was NOT a VINE item) so I was excited about that however, once I received them and tried them, I was beyond satisfied with the purchase!!!They're small (which is AWESOME for people with smaller hands), sharp (probably not a great idea to let younger children use-obviously!), comfortable grip due to having a rubber lining inside the handles, ambidextirous so either a Righty or Lefty can use them, and I mean, they're GREAT quality!!If you need a good set of scissors that is small, able to reach tight cutting points, etc...Here they are!!!",5
B072RV8SC7,"I am an artsy person who is always making something and fixing something around the house.  These are solid and nice!  Perfect.  They cut so nice.  I am not cutting metal.  All types of fabric, vinyl, cardboard, canvas.  Works great.",5
B072RV8SC7,"Well made, comfortable in the hand and sharp",5
B072RV8SC7,Nice scissors. Very sharp.,5
B072RV8SC7,Fav wee snippets. Love them,5
B072RV8SC7,"These scissors are small, sharp, and priced right. Just what I was looking for!",5
B072RV8SC7,"I got these today and almost everything about them are great.Now I'm not complaining, it might be my own ignorance but when I saw ""6"" inches I thought it was the shear size and not the entire length from handle to tip.They are made well and kind of on par with Fiskars.The rivet that holds the entire thing together is nice and sturdy. They are sharp but I JUST took them out of the package.I needed a little bigger because I now have Primary Progressive MS and I need scissors for common things I used to do everyday like opening packages or anything plastic. My hands only work when they are in a good mood but scissors to cut through packages/ anything plastic wrapped with very few cuts sometimes means the difference in opening packages or waiting until my fingers and hands are in better moods... possibly for days or even a week.So far they seem to be well worth the money.",4
B072RV8SC7,"Simply put, these scissors are great! They only fit two fingers in the handles so it's not the most comfortable to hold for extended periods of time, but they're perfectly designed for cutting open bags, tape, letters, string, and more! These have definitely replaced my previous scissors by and far!",5
B072RV8SC7,"Just the right size for my hand, very sharp.",5
B072RV8SC7,Works good.,4
B072RV8SC7,These are just what I was looking for. They cut thicker items very well. The scissors are very well built. Reasonable price for a great item.,5
B072RV8SC7,"Not super heavy duty, but certainly sturdy and a good product for the price.  It cuts through plastic feed bags easily.  I'm quite satisfied.",5
B072RV8SC7,"These scissors are a good quality and are good for general cutting of small items like paper, thread, fabric, etc. They're a nice addition to my craft/sewing scissor collection.  I only gave them 4 stars, however, because they are not good for snipping things.  The scissors do not cut even 20 lb paper all they way to the point of the blades.  The cut is excellent up to the point, but if you're needing scissors to do snipping in tiny places, these are not the best choice.  For general use, however, I recommend them!",4
B072RV8SC7,Bought it for school and my kid can cut cardboard without any issues. Very well built.,5
B072RV8SC7,"These are my favorite brand of scissors and they've never let me down. They are reasonably priced, often on sale, and they are great multipurpose scissors. Good comfortable handle. Will cut cleanly to the tip and can be adjusted for cutting thicker items or using as a single blade. Stay sharp a long time and then can be sharpened as needed. They clean up well if they get dirty or sticky. They cut everything the package says they do and more (I've used these to cut memory foam up to 3"" thick.) I have all the sizes and shapes they sell and have never been disappointed. I buy them as gifts too. I will note that I have average size & strength hands and no serious mobility problems in my hands/arms. I also use scissors in a right-handed way and haven't tested them with the left or for left handed people. Overall, a good buy that gives value for money, especially if you can get them on sale.",5
B072RV8SC7,"Cardboard I thought is the most annoying thing to cut. Not with these scissors. Cutting cardboard is like cutting paper, easy and smooth. Buy it! You need this product!!",5
B072RV8SC7,"Started used small scissors when I had wrist surgery and discovered it was far easier to use small pairs of scissors when hand/wrist mobility is reduced. Now that I have my mobility back, I still prefer them over larger scissors. This particular pair is especially well made.",5
B072RV8SC7,Sharp and pointed for craft use.,5
B072RV8SC7,Wish I got 2,5
B072RV8SC7,"Good price. Cut well. Small size, but that's what I wanted. Good deal",5
B072RV8SC7,I love these and use them all the time.,5
B072RV8SC7,"All 3 clippers (large, small, and angled), the cuticle nipper, cuticle scrapper, and the other various scrapers were impressively sharp.My overnight bag was recently stolen, so my first purchase to replenish my hygiene tools was a 4pc set from a blue big box retailer for aprox $8. I got it out to the car to test it and immediately returned it. The tools in that set were dull and horrible. I was unsure how sharp these items would be when I saw them listed at this price but I couldn't be happier. The wife was so impressed with the two cuticle tools she wants to order a kit just for those tools.I honestly can't imagine what kind of nails or talons some of these people who wrote negative reviews were trying to clip.I will admit the case, although it's kind of nice looking, is a bit cumbersome and overall cheaply-made.I recently noticed that most of the tools have holes pre-drilled in the. I'm currently experimenting with some type of key ring or quick release mechanism I can put my favorites on for easy access when traveling. No need in traveling with a case filled up with tools, half of which I have no idea what they are.",4
B072RV8SC7,"Nothing wrong with them, per se, but I'm sure you can do better at the same price.  I would not recommend them for sewing, and I personally would not buy again",3
B072RV8SC7,Buena calidad,5
B072RV8SC7,"I use these for many small places with sewing, paper, ribbons etc.  just perfect.",5
B072RV8SC7,Great little scissors. Really sharp. Easy to handle. I use them to cut out decals for model cars and they work great. The price was terrific for such a quality piece of equipment.,5
B072RV8SC7,They seem solid and do what I expect them to do... cut yarn. No complaints.,5
B072RV8SC7,Great for cutting yarn,5
B072RV8SC7,"Sharp. Small, good for everyday light use. Seem sturdy like they will last.",5
B072RV8SC7,"I wanted something small to cut things out from my Cricut stuff and these work very well, and are the perfect size.",5
B072RV8SC7,As a collage artist sharp pointy scissors are super important- these scissors give me more control and maneuverability thus allowing me to cut more accurately.,5
B072RV8SC7,Tiny point where blades come together is perfect for snipping tiny pieces when crafting and card making!,5
B072RV8SC7,These are great for scrapbooking! Precision tool.,5
B072RV8SC7,Hard to write a review when headline says it all.,5
B072RV8SC7,"I have a pair of these in the kitchen that are used daily by everyone in the house from opening packages to making projects for school. They always end up in someone else's room because they are the best scissors and stay sharp. So it was time to buy another pair just for me. Good as the old pair, but no glue, gogurt or stains on these.",5
B072RV8SC7,"Quick shipping. Item as described. I keep this scissors in my bathroom. Used for trimming bangs to cutting strings off clothes and anything else you need! Sharp, fits in hand nicely and gets the job done.",5
B072RV8SC7,These do exactly what I want them to do. I use them in my boat for cutting the fishing line. I really like them.  I will buy them again. They are nice and sharp.,5
B072RV8SC7,"Got this for my wife.  When I tried it, it was easy to use and sturdy.  The best news is that my wife likes it for the same reasons and more.",5
B072RV8SC7,I use these scissors at work and put a set of scissors through thed grind more then most will ever use scissors and i have nothing negative about these scissors. I always keep a backup set which i havent needed to goto yet except when i miss placed my first string set haha. worth every cent,5
B072RV8SC7,Was excited to purchase these scissors but after I got them found out that they are not set right so that they would cut evenly. They cut best close to the point but not so good further back on the scissors.,4
B072RV8SC7,A little smaller than I expected but still a good price and it worked for what I needed them for. Thanks,4
B072RV8SC7,"These are handy to keep around the house (kitchen, office, bedroom/office) for quick snip use. In the kitchen, I use these to help open things like seasoning packets, bags inside cereal boxes, cookies, etc. In the bathroom, they are often used to remove tags from new clothing, to trim loose threads, and aid opening those 'bubble on cardboard' things that hold dental floss, toothbrushes, cotton swabs, and the like. This particular style is best for our house with a southpaw in addition to normal persons, because the are not specific for right and left hand use.",5
B072RV8SC7,Very handy for small projects. Very sharp. They have become my go to for many different things.,4
B072RV8SC7,"I like how well these cut heavy paper, craft board and cardboard.",5
B072RV8SC7,I need to get a lot of tight spots for my crafts and these work perfectly for them! Definitely recommend!,5
B072RV8SC7,These work great for all my yarn crafts.  They are sharp and cut evenly without creating fraying.,5
B072RV8SC7,Excellent performance.  Cuts foam tape without leaving any residue or sticky particles. Great for scrapbooking papers amd sewing fabrics. Highly recommend item.,5
B072RV8SC7,"I have already misplaced both of mine, so I won't be posting pictures, but they are indeed scissors, and for a gadget guy like myself, they were beyond expectation on the material I had a chance to use them on! I will no doubt send some to my daughters. Just because I like them to have good stuff, and it confuses them when Dad sends them scissors or battery testers. Eventually, they get it.",5
B072RV8SC7,ease of cutting comfort good grip,5
B004M59O4C,"This was a great find.  Very good price for very nice paper.  The surface is perfect for painting as the colors stay true, and the brushes slide easily across the surface.  I have painted for years and this is my favorite!  It is well priced and very good quality.  it absorbed the moisture with no running or curling.",5
B004M59O4C,I like the texture and sturdiness of this paper.,5
B004M59O4C,"I use this paper to make professional watercolor and gauche cards that don't require tons of layering or reworking. The texture is fine enough that it does pretty well with masking fluid as well as pen and ink. It's about what you expect for cold pressed paper. If you're going to be doing more complex layering work or even a lot of wet techniques, you'll want something better suited.This paper is also excellent for testing colors, trying a new technique, or painting a draft piece before doing it on more expensive paper. I have tried several different inexpensive watercolor papers and this one is my favorite because it is heavy enough and performs well enough (under specific limited conditions) for professional use.",5
B004M59O4C,"I'm just getting started with watercolors, so I don't have much to compare. But this paper seems nice, and takes the paint well. Good value. Hefty enough and doesn't bleed through.",5
B004M59O4C,To print photos,5
B004M59O4C,As expected,4
B004M59O4C,Great quality & price,5
B004M59O4C,This paper is okay for beginners but I would not purchase again. It warps even while being fully taped down! Very frustrating and not great for all types of watercolor.,3
B004M59O4C,"I use a lot of this paper, because Im trying to learn how to watercolor.  Iv tried in the past, but the paper was so doggone expensive, I didn't want to waste it.  so, I didn't get a lot of practice that I needed.Im so glad I found this affordable good paper.  It won't stand up to a lot of scrubbing, and layering like Ttrathmore or Arches, but its thirty sheets for half the price of a ten sheet arches block.I finally got brave enough to buy a big size paper, too.  I got the big 18x24 too.I find the 9x12, is the perfect size for travel, and holds up better than the larger sizes.  Iv used one a month for several months now, and Im actually seeing some decent progress in my abilities to end up with a nice watercolor.I gave landscape as a Christmas gift!  He loved it, and got misty that someone would give him such a great gift.It is not matted, and put into a nice $6.00 frame.I use drafting tape for creating a nice boarder.  other art tapes, and painters tapes tend to pull off the top layer of this paper, which is disheartening after ending up with a successful painting.  Be very careful about how you pull the tape off this paper.Just as well, if not for the great price,  how readily available it is,  (its what walmart uses. I was so happy when walmart began to stock this paper)I get this paper as gifts now from my loved ones.  they are actually taking calling dibs on my paintings now.Iv been posting a painting a day on facebook.  My friends are calling dibs on some of them.  one person has a collection four paintings that they kept offering to pay for!Im telling you all this, because it just wouldn't have been possible to learn anything while being afraid to waste expensive paper.If I do get a nice painting, this paper is still archival quality paper that will last, and it frames up very well.I think this is very funny, but I have another friend who keeps saying Im so talented.  Im not.Iv been painting my tail off.30 pieces of paper for ten bucks.  Iv gotten it as low as 7.99.No one would be calling dibs on my daily dabble if I hadn't found this wonderful affordable paper.good product,  varying prices, and readily available just about anywhere.",5
B004M59O4C,Love it.,5
B004M59O4C,"This pad is a great starting point, especially for beginners like myself! It is hard to beat the price, especially when the pad is on sale. I seem to have a preference for working with 100% cotton paper, personally. I can't hold that preference against the item, however.",4
B004M59O4C,"I paint and occasionally teach watercolor painting.  This is my ""go-to"" paper for students and me alike.  I recently demonstrated on the most expensive paper and had a student practice on it as well.  Neither of us considered the 100% cotton paper noticeably or significantly better than this product.  It may be a personal preference or the techniques you use that make a difference.  I assume, for example, you cannot scrub this paper as much without damaging the surface, but that isn't something I do or encourage my students to do. My recommendation is to purchase this paper and see if it meets your needs.  If you don't like it you can always use it for quick studies, greeting cards, or experimenting with color swatches.  I think you will find it works well and is a bargain.",5
B004M59O4C,The teacher requested; the kids loved.,4
B004M59O4C,"I love the texture of the paper.  The price point is unbeatable. It does warp a bit with heavy water use; however, I just tape the page down before painting to prevent it. Arrived as indicated in perfect condition.",5
B004M59O4C,"Perfect for watercolors, and the size makes this paper perfect for other projects, as well. Super easy to carry. Fits right into your backpack. It's great, too, that the pages don't stick together in the pad, because of the high quality texture of the paper. Highly recommend.",5
B004M59O4C,Nice weight. Works very well for watercolor painting,5
B004M59O4C,Very good quality,5
B004M59O4C,"I use this paper to test colors and values. I also use it for my beginner water color classes. It is one of the best student grade papers I have found. It certainly is not like a good 100% cotton paper, but its hard to beat for the price.",4
B004M59O4C,"This was recommended on one of my Pinterest pages for creating a fun pic collage and this paper does not disappoint.  The color, texture and sturdiness are exactly what I was hoping for.",5
B004M59O4C,"Not well packaged - just a plastic envelope and the cover ended up ripping.  Inside pages are ok and useable, but would not purchase from this vendor again.",3
B004M59O4C,i buy art supplies for my grand daughter. she tells me what she needs and i get them. she was happy to get these,5
B004M59O4C,Paper is good quality,5
B004M59O4C,great for my art class,5
B004M59O4C,"Very smooth. It takes water color, pen and ink, markers and charcoal very well. Not expensive but worth the price.",5
B004M59O4C,"I have been using this Canson Cold-Press Watercolor paper for years and it works great! The paper has a porous texture to it from the cold-press process.I have used it with ink, watercolor, and watercolor markers. The only medium it worked poorly with were felt-tipped watercolor markers and nothing I have held up to those things!",5
B004M59O4C,"I couldn't decide between hot press, and cold press, so I got both!Hot press has less texture but can be more controlled, and sometimes that's what you want when creating.Cold press has a lot of texture and more 'bleed' or 'flow', which is also sometimes what you prefer.The paper is a great quality and arrived very quickly.",5
B004M59O4C,This watercolor paper is top of the line quality! The price was great and the delivery time was fast!,5
B004M59O4C,Part of a gifted. Nice weight and works well for their paintings,5
B004M59O4C,The paper is thick like card stock. One side is texture while the other side is smooth. This works well for my child's art class.,5
B004M59O4C,I like heavy weight paper for watercolor and acrylics paintingThis is an inexpensive nice weight paper to practice with.,4
B004M59O4C,Would recommend,5
B004M59O4C,Bought for my daughters new acrylic pen set.  She loves the paper.,5
B004M59O4C,Pleased with purchase.,5
B004M59O4C,"I recommend this for small projects only, sketches just because simply there are better quality papers for watercolor,but this is a good paper for acrylics, gouache or maybe other mediums rather than watercolors.Is cheap if you are looking to practice and don't want to spend in really expensive quality paper.",4
B004M59O4C,Great quality watercolor paper for the price,5
B004M59O4C,"This is a joy to work with,  especially wet in wet.",5
B004M59O4C,"Perfect size, excellent water resistance and loveeee the texture of the paper",5
B004M59O4C,Just what I needed for my artwork!,5
B004M59O4C,I have heard many great things about this paper from other artists in the community. I hear it makes a great practice paper for watercolor artists of any level. I bought this pad to use for practice at home as I learn new techniques and try new media. I am pleased and will buy again.,4
B004M59O4C,"This paper is great for beginner learners, especially to learn technique. It's also thick enough to be great for wet painting, as the paper absorbs water but doesn't break down under constant use. Obviously, Arches is some of the best out there for wet painting and more experienced painters, but if you're on a budget or just want to practice, the quality of the paper and how much you get in this notebook is great.I'd definitely purchase again, even if for casual practice and learning.",4
B004M59O4C,"I am artist who has always had a disdain for watercolor art.... until NOW! I finally forced myself to confront the medium I've so LONG dreaded and despised... initially as a challenge to my proud and competitive self, lol, but I have realized that so much more than idyllic lake scenes with mild flora and fauna can be rendered with vibrance, energy, and even abstraction in watercolor! Now that I'm jumping into the water...color... it's exciting and this paper is surely helping along with my success! I am not a formally trained watercolorist, so I'm learning as I go, but as long as I use my Frog Painter's Tape underneath the paper to bind to my masonite clipboards, with the four sides taped on the outer edge, I have no warped and curled up paintings. After several days of being allowed to dry with the Frog tape left on, the paper comes up from the board flat and beautiful. It's so thick, and the size is ideal for me. A few times, I've used my bonefolder to fold it in half and tear so that I can get two smaller paintings from just one sheet. I also recommend the Canson XL Mixed Media Pads! They are thick and smooth papers that aren't as thick as watercolor paper, but way sturdier than typical sketch/drawing paper and are great for printmaking/drawing/acrylic painting, even light watercolor works. Thank you, Canson!!!",5
B004M59O4C,I make a lot of cards and this is a good choice for a paper that doesn't cost a lot but works pretty well for watercolor cards.,5
B004M59O4C,"Really happy with this purchase as a beginner to watercolor painting.  In the end, I went with 4 stars simply because it's not without flaw.  But I would be amazed if you could find a better paper for this price and without wanting to invest a lot into a new hobby, it is perfect for my need.Edit: Increased the rating to 5 stars as I have learned the bubbling problem is due to me not wetting the paper prior to painting.  Once doing this, the bubbling became so much less severe that any flaws are meaningless when considering this price point.  Definitely recommend this paper!Pros:1. Bright, white color to the paper.2. Absorbancy seems on par with what I expected it would be.3. Bleeding was nearly non-existent and the paint stayed where I placed it.4. Pleasant matte texture per standard watercolor paper.Cons:1. The bubble/warp issue.  This is probably my fault, but I didn't feel I was even using that much water.  It settled down after it dried, but the massive bubbles while I was painting made it hard to do straight lines and get even coverage.2. The cover of the pad was glued slightly askew so the edges of the paper are exposed in one corner.",5
B004M59O4C,This paper has done all I asked of it.,4
B004M59O4C,We do a lot of homeschool painting projects. This is our go-to watercolor paper! I like to order this size and then cut it into halves or fourths depending on what we are making. I've also cut and bound it into books for us to paint in.,5
B004M59O4C,"My kids love love love watercolor, and we go through the paper at our home.  The price on this product fluctuates quite a bit so keep it in your cart for a bit and watch it - when it dips under $7 I stock up.  This is a nice heavy weight, with light texturing to it.  I like this large size because I can cut it in half or quarter it and the kids still have a nice size surface to work with.  I am puzzled at the poor reviews.  To be fair, we don't super soak/saturate the paper normally.  But it does NOT dull colors and it does NOT pile on us.  Perhaps that's because my children aren't using any advanced techniques on the paper.  I have worked with Strathmore paper before and did not find it noticeably different in how much it warps or how it absorbs color, but again - we are novice painters.  :)I attached two pictures of some of the vivid colors we get from this bright white paper.  Be kind, the work is from my three year old!",5
B004M59O4C,This is nice paper. It does have a slightly yellow tint to it which you can't really tell unless you're directly comparing it with another paper.,4
B004M59O4C,Good quality for the price,5
B004M59O4C,"This watercolor pad is a dream for artists! Its thickness prevents watercolor paints from soaking through, ensuring vibrant results. It dries flat every time, and using painters tape for clean lines is a breeze - the paper doesn't tear when peeled off. A must-have for any watercolor enthusiast!",5
B004M59O4C,"I like this paper, doing watercolors.",5
B004M59O4C,Bought as a gift to pair up with water color markers. Paper is nice quality and should hold up with the markets.,5
B004M59O4C,"Disliked that Amazon search for 100% cotton watercolor paper always brings up Canson Not Cotton results. Trying to make it do what 100% cotton paper will do in my self study WC course is a recipe for heartbreak. Get the real thing, using my several packs for testing colors now. Lifetime supply.",3
B004M59O4C,shipped quickly,5
B004M59O4C,"I do chuckle with some of the reviews from elite artists.  This paper is an excellent value at its price and is great for its intended uses.  It is also an excellent example of what we used to see more of in the commercial marketplace.  Canson will develop products for different uses and price points, but never a ""cheap"" product.  If they couldn't maintain a certain standard for a ""student, budget, entry level,"" whatever you want to call it. they wouldn't compete in that market.  In some cases and days, brands still do matter.",5
B004M59O4C,Using for a craft project later in Feb. Im sure the paper will be fine.,4
B004M59O4C,"Nice, thick paper perfect for watercolor artists. I bought these to use over the holidays with kids and it worked great. We cut in half and made 5x7 cards. Definitely thicker then I was expecting which is a pleasant surprise, especially when doing watercolor! I recommend this for those just getting starting and wanting an affordable paper product.",5
B004M59O4C,The product came in good condition.,5
B004M59O4C,Love the pad. I am a beginner but absolutely love how easy it is to paint on the paper.,5
B004M59O4C,"For such expensive paper, they should have packaged it better than in an envelope. Now every page is damaged, so I will have to size down my paintings. Not my money's worth.Edit: Amazon sent me a replacement and this one has no damages. Thank you, Amazon!",5
B004M59O4C,"I have always been a big fan of canson paper, good product at a reasonable price.The XL watercolor paper does not disappoint. And with just starting with watercolor I feel like I can experiment and make all the mistakes I want with out breaking the bank",5
B004M59O4C,"This is some of the best watercolor paper for the price I have ever used. I started watercoloring in 2020 during the pandemic...fell in love with it and have been doing it ever since. I knew nothing about papers, etc..I tried this, being a beginner, and was very impressed with the quality...It is my favorite now...expecially if you're jus starting out and don't want to get too involved financially... this is the paper for you...",5
B004M59O4C,"I'm a professional watercolor artist and have used all the best paper out there. Arches, Hahnemuhle, Baohong...all have their quirks. This paper is no different. It's not cotton but it works. This little line and wash I did behaved quite well. I'm enjoying the paper. It just might be good enough to handle a commission or 2.I ordered the 2 pack but only received one. I hope the seller makes it right. The paper gets 5 stars, the seller...not.",4
B004M59O4C,Great for watercolor,5
B004M59O4C,"I purchased this for class. It worked perfectly and paper did not curl on edges, easy to use.A great product, worth it.",5
B004M59O4C,"I've never seen a product advertised for watercolor paper be so unbelievably bad at being watercolor paper. Color pools on the top and the paper warps a lot. You can't layer colors because the paper doesn't absorb anything and you just pick up colors you've put down.That said, it's excellent for inks and markers and pencil work. It's super smooth and lays down ink pens really well and doesn't bleed through. Definitely my go-to for Copic marker pieces and just black and white pieces. So if you need good marker paper, this is the one.If being used for watercolor purposes, best save it for testing colors or kids use only.When it comes to watercolors, even poor quality watercolors can look amazing as long as you use high quality paper 100% cotton paper. Save this paper for other projects.",4
B004M59O4C,Disappointed that its not white. My clouds look more grey.,3
B004M59O4C,My son loved it,5
B004M59O4C,"This was my first time buying this type a paper. A true beginner to watercolor painting.I've used it a few times already and find it easy to work with. Great quality paper, heavy and durable. Easy to paint on without bleeding through. Even after drying that paper is not distorted from my lack of training on how much liquid to use while painting. Will continue to use this paper, as I continue to grow my skills.",5
B004M59O4C,Easy to remove from the pad. Great watercolor paper. Very durable.,5
B004M59O4C,The paper is inexpensive.  However for watercolor purposes its characteristics do not allow for the type of results that can be achieved with 100% cotton paper.  I tried to use it as practice paper but found it limitations to be frustrating.  I would not recommend it for experienced artists or beginners.,2
B004M59O4C,. . .great products. Been buying their products for years. I appreciate their consistent quality.,4
B004M59O4C,"Beginners and experienced watercolor painters will enjoy this high quality, thick and absorbent paper in standard sizes.",5
B07H4LTQ1D,"I have become accustomed over the years to scissors that don't work very well.  I blamed it on user error, as I have severe arthritis as well as carpal tunnel.  I spent $30 each for 2 pairs of scissors that allegedly has lifetime warranties, that is until the plastic hinges broke, and that voided the warranty-Ha!  Then I bought these scissors and  life was good again. They are as smooth as butter.  I just wrapped all of my Christmas gifts, and it was an enjoyable experience, primarily because of these excellent scissors.  It was not a struggle to cut wrapping paper and my hands did not hurt at the end. If you need a good quality pair of scissors, do yourself a favor and buy these.  It'd money well spent.",5
B07H4LTQ1D,"Got them for paper crafting, and they work well. They are moderately comfortable, would be very comfortable if they added just a tad more room for fingers.",5
B07H4LTQ1D,I love these titanium scissors!  The retain their sharpness and perform exceptionally well over many months of use.  They put all my other non-titanium scissors to shame.,5
B07H4LTQ1D,"I'm using this scissors in the kitchen. It is nice and sharp and opens plastic bags really easily. A good size and weight. The only problem is that it takes a bit of effort to open and close. This is helped by a drop of oil, but the problem remains. Not the easiest scissors to use, but it is sharp. Blades are nonstick-coated, which is nice.",4
B07H4LTQ1D,Not super sharp but sturdy Lived up to promise that it was good for cutting cardboard Did cut cardboard boxes with no trouble,4
B07H4LTQ1D,"These scissors are intensely sharp and extremely easy to maneuver. We bought these over the holidays and used them to help wrap gifts, open gifts and assemble gifts. There is a special satisfaction when cutting wrapping paper and the scissors slide straight across without you having to push down on the handle at all and these scissors totally gave that satisfaction! There were no snags or weird cuts while using them! They were also very handy while cutting through the titanium cardboard that held many of our daughter's toys hostage. Oh and we've used them to cut the stems of 5 sunflowers at the same time- the large, tall sunflowers that tower over all other flowers of the field! We totally recommend these scissors, it's a great deal for a great product!",5
B07H4LTQ1D,Great price for these and comfortable to use,5
B07H4LTQ1D,"Other low cost scissors I have tried were so dull and disappointing.I thought I was going to have to pay big bucks for scissors that are sharp and well  made.But these LIVINGO scissors are great. They are nice and sharp and appear to be very well made.  I could not be more pleased. But them, you will like them!",5
B07H4LTQ1D,"I'm making face masks and needed a new pair of scissors.  Although these scissors rate excellent, they are not smooth and have some drag when cutting cotton fabric.  They could be sharper too.  Good for cutting other things, maybe, but not what I needed them for!",3
B07H4LTQ1D,"I am a left handed person and I often have problems using scissors.  I was thrilled when I tried them out, they worked just fine for my left hand.  In fact, they were very easy to use and were quite sharp.  I also like their balance and weight.",5

B07H4LTQ1D,"These scissors are fantastic for everyday use. The comfort grip makes them easy to handle, and the stainless steel blades cut smoothly through various materials.

B07H4LTQ1D,I use these scissors for my embroidery work,4
B07H4LTQ1D,Incredibly sharp. Be careful. I literally almost cut the tip of my finger off....think 'pac man'. My finger is still healing after over a month since I severed it. These are really good scissors. Just be sure you're treating them as if they are a razor blade until they start to dull......lesson learned.,5
B07H4LTQ1D,"As soon as I got these scissors, I tried them out on double stick foam tape.  It cut like paper.  Nothing stuck to the blades.  Made a nice clean cut - no matter how small the cut was.The blades are very sharp and the handle grip feels very comfortable.A lifetime warrantee is a major plus too.If you're using these for paper crafts, the point is kind of blunt, so if you need to do 'fussy cutting', these may not work for you - depending on how detailed your project is.",5
B07H4LTQ1D,"I use one in the kitchen and the other one in the office. In both of them, they cut perfectly fine and they are sharp enough. Thank you!",5
B07H4LTQ1D,I initially purchased a pair of these scissors to replace a pair of Wiss scissors I used for cutting fiberglass cloth.  I loved the price and the sharpness of  the these that I decide to buy a bunch to keep around the house and give one to my wife.,5
B07H4LTQ1D,"These are the first scissors from this manufacturer that I have not thought were excellent. These seem pretty good, but I noticed that occasionally the scissors do not close to the tip unless you exert a lot of pressure. I cannot see a reason for that.",4
B07H4LTQ1D,"I've been on a mission for a good pair of scissors for a while.  Mine had gotten dull or weren't that great to start with, but then I found and decided to try these out.  I was impressed with sharpness, ease of cutting, durability, easy to handle and use, and the value for the price.  Definitely recommend!",5
B07H4LTQ1D,Very sharp and comfortable to use.,5

B07H4LTQ1D,"Scissors were okay for about a month and then became so dull as to be worthless, though they were used only for ordinary tasks (cutting string, paper, packaging, etc.). I do not recommend them and can't imagine how these other reviewers could rave about them.",2
B07H4LTQ1D,Best scissors I've found for the price!,5
B07H4LTQ1D,"Comfortable and stylish, perfect for older kids' school supplies! Blade is super sharp for cutting.",5
B0038F1A0S,Works as expected. Good quality. Very useful,5
B0038F1A0S,"This is usual Fiskars quality - well built, cuts cleanly, and works as it should.The only nit - that blade is sharp and you have to be cautious when handling.  It doesn't take much of a swipe to give you what'll hurt like the worst paper cut, ever...",5
B0038F1A0S,"works great.  Custom cut paper and card stock. Not designed commercial or heavy duty use.  For what I need it is great.  I did order extra cutter blades.  Firm believer in ""Murphy's Law""",5
B0038F1A0S,"I just received this and put it through the basic paces, and am very happy with what I see so far.  I'll update if there are any significant changes when I put it to more practical use.tl;dr - I was able to cut precisely on a line without specific measurement; I was able to accurately measure a distance from the paper's edge; I was able to cut 6 sheets of paper cleanly; they advertise it for 7 sheets, but the 7th sheet tends to get scored instead of cut.The sheet count is questionable (maybe they somewhere specify a weight of paper for which it cuts 7?) and some specifics of the design could be a little better, but the cutline wire is a very nice addition over others I've used and it seems up to any task you could reasonably ask of a portable paper trimmer.Some more in-depth points:  Before I bought this, I read through a bunch of the reviews, and want to address a couple points from the negative reviews...First and foremost: this is a portable paper trimmer advertised for ""trimming office papers, coupons, photos and more"". Now... I know ""and more"" is ambiguous, but I think given the general character of things it says it can do, expecting it to be good for professional card-making (to cite one example) seems like a stretch.With that in mind:1) Distance Scale IssuesThere is a gap in the scale for measuring the distance from the cut line.  The scale on the main body ends at about 3-11/16"" ; and the scale on the folding arm starts at 4-1/16"".  (Some reviews claimed that 4-1/4"" or 4 1/2"" were not on the scale; at least on the current model as I received, both are on the arm's scale.)Also I saw at least one claim that the scale on the arm is not accurate.  I did not find this to be true.  The arm is ""sunken"" relative to the main body, so there is a potential for parallax and it could be hard to read the scale correctly, but it is not mechanically off.  Again it could be an older model was less accurate, but I think it's more likely that the photo used to ""prove"" the scale inaccurate was taken at an angle that exhibited parallax.While the scale gap may not be at certain distance marks considered ""particularly important"", the gap does exist - as it must for this design of trimmer.  If you need to measure a cut that falls in that gap, you likely will have to improvise.  For one-off jobs that can be done.  For jobs to be repeated frequently, it could get very tedious.  Again note the type of job this model is advertised to do.And while the arm scale is not off, it is potentially hard to get a good reading.  It would be nice if they'd designed it to be on level with the main surface of the trimmer's body.  Still, it's a compromise in support of the small size - hence ""portable"" paper trimmer.  It may make accurate usage slower for cuts measured in that way, which again would be mostly a problem on repeated jobs for which a different class of paper cutter might be better suited.2) A few reviewers were unhappy that the cutline is in the middle of the plastic part that pins the paper down, rather than at one side or the other.  I found this to be a huge advantage, in that the paper is held in place on both sides of the cutline (unless trimming right at the edge of the paper).  The supposed drawback is that you wouldn't be able to see where the cut would be, but there is a wire running pretty precisely over the blade path - and as a result I can use this trimmer more precisely than the previous one I had (which had the cutline off to the side of the plastic).3) There were complaints about flimsy construction.  I guess you're going to get that with any light-weight plastic product, but... well, it's designed to be light weight.  Again: ""portable"".  If you're of the mind that everything has to be made of solid steel to be considered sturdy, then maybe this isn't for you; but it seems suited to stand up to the wear and tear of cutting through a few sheets of paper.Bottom line: if the measuring arm were a little better designed to make accurate measurements easier, and if the advertising set clearer expectations about page count, this would probably be a 5-star review.  It's still a huge step up from other inexpensive portable trimmers I've used.",4
B0038F1A0S,"Easy to use straight out of the package. Will cut through several pieces of heavy weight water color or other thick paper. Extension arm is great for larger paper. Other reviews say extension arm doesn't go out all the way, that is a user error, it has a safety locking feature you just have to push it a little and will easily lock out fully.",5
B0038F1A0S,I had a Fiskars trimmer for many many years and it just needed to be replaced...I got this one and it's fabulous. Cuts my paper straight and super smooth. Great product!!,5
B0038F1A0S,It says it cuts through 10 sheets but it barely can cut through 3. What's great is that the paper doesn't move as you slide the blade as it does with other style cutters.,4
B0038F1A0S,I love this paper trimmer. One of the best features is the swing out arm that locks into place while in use and in storage. I don't know why there are negative comments concerning that. It doesn't slip and slide on the table while using it. The scale and base deck grid are very helpful.This product is built sturdy and should last me a lifetime. I have used an Xacto (item # 26400) for many years but a hinge broke and made it even more difficult to use.Using it to turn my study Bible into a Journaling Bible by making insert pages. We also preserve food and cutt vacuum sealer bags to size.I highly recommend this product for home use.,5
B0038F1A0S,"I've had the chance to use both a roller-cutter paper trimmer and this fixed blade trimmer. The roller cutter is superior, by a wide margin. The roller concept is inherently better than a rip blade, which is what this trimmer uses.Occasional users will do well with this trimmer. It's a good value for intermittent users. It makes square cuts, & can cut strips down to 1/2"" consistently if you're careful. There's no paper clamp, and  you have to be careful that the paper doesn't slip while you're cutting it.I've used it to cut ordinary printer paper, inkjet photo paper, vellum, Bristol, and 68# drawing paper. Cuts on photo paper, Bristol and drawing paper are a bit ragged. Printer paper and vellum make clean cuts. I haven't tried it on transparency film, but considering how it works on vellum it'll probably make a clean cut -- until the blade gets dull, which I suspect won't take too long. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and I don't use it often, so this trimmer is adequate for my needs. It's not junk, and it's not great; it's adequate, sort of like your spouse.If you are a ""serious"" hobbyist, pay more and get a roller cutter. Note that replacement blades for this are only available from Fiskars and they have the plastic handle attached -- vendor lock and a lot of waste. Roller cutter blades are a commodity item that's available from many sources, and there are specialty blades for paper, plastic, or fabric.Bottom line: Use a trimmer a few times a year? Buy this one.  Use it every week? Buy a roller cutter.",3
B0038F1A0S,"I just finished  printing about 25 Christmas Cards,  and I had to trip the edges. I made 2 cards on each page so I had to cut the page in half.  Lots of cutting. So I decided I need a paper cutter. The Fiskars did the job.Yes it has a tight wire you can see to line up where the cut will be.  I works.  Easy to see and position the paper , then slide the blade along the track.  Bingo it's cut.  Very happy with this cutter.  I ordered extra blades, I'm sure I'll need them for future projects.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I love this, I use it almost everyday",5
B0038F1A0S,"Great product, works well, durable, would recommend",5
B0038F1A0S,Upon opening the item i noticed there was bubbles stuck beneath the decal sticker. Tried getting it out with a squeegee but no luck. Probably wont affect performance but still disappointing.,4
B0038F1A0S,Works well,4
B0038F1A0S,"Product was great, but it got shipped snail mail and was four days late to arrive.",5
B0038F1A0S,"Bought mine just about 5 years ago. Use it almost every day for about 50+ cuts. It is still going strong. Best investment I made for my crafting and Etsy needs. It's light enough to take with me, and solid enough to not bend under pressure. The little wire doesn't really help but I know how to eye ball it. When you need affordable excellence this is it.",5
B0038F1A0S,"In my card making I have been having trouble with my paper trimmer. I thought it was me, but the more I tried to be perfectly accurate, I would still get paper that wasn't square. My son gave me an Amazon gift card for Mother's Day and so I decided to use it to buy a new trimmer. What I appreciate is that the measurements that are pointed out are all in inches. Also for the most part, the measurements show the spots to make regular card sizes and not a plethora of different measurement which is what was thowing me off.  I had been wanting to make my granddaughter paper pieces to make quilt blocks with them as she loves to put actual cloth pieces on my quilt wall. I discovered that this new trimmer can sit on my lap desk that I use all the time. So while sitting on my couch relaxing I was able to cut up lots and lots of 6x6 paper to the sizes that I needed and they all turned out the same size and were square. I am very happy to have this trimmer. It doesn't have the different blades that my other trimmer has but I can get around that as needed. I am very happy that I got this.",5
B0038F1A0S,Love it!,5
B0038F1A0S,I love it! I had another brand and it was hard to use. The blade didn't cut where you thought it should. This brand has a small metal band that you line up to what you want to cut. Precise EVERY time!!! It's affordable as well.,5
B0038F1A0S,"As for doing the job, it is great.  Am now able to trim the coloring pages from c. books pages I am using to make quilts for the kids of the doctor's assistants.  The two ladies both have kids, ages from 2 to 5.I want to thank them for all the support and encouragement they have given.  Decided to make quilts for their kids.  Anyhow, in cutting of the top and bottoms and sides to get rid of extra paper and using sissors, I didn't do a very good job in keeping the cutting straight.When I saw the paper cutter and the low price, I ordered one.  It took me a few tries to get the position right, but it does a great job.The only negative, which I able to ignore is that there is a slight tear in one area.  It doesn't stop me from getting the pages cut, so no big deal, the good out ways the ""bad"".I would recommend it, unless you are Really picky.  Don't mean to sound snarly but some people get too picky, in my own opinion.  Not really judging, I can be picky in some areas, according to hubby.",4
B0038F1A0S,"I purchased this brand and model because I don't like guillotine paper cutters and I like to have the guide lines on my paper cutters. I'm not sure how this will hold up to a lifetime warranty, as I've had it about a month and it doesn't always cut all the way through one sheet of thin printer paper, and often leaves a ragged edge. My favorite and preferred paper cutter is in storage, so I needed a replacement that was approximately the same size and a similar model. I've had my other paper cutter for years (through graduate school) and have never had to replace the razor on it. It's plastic, too, but the part with the grid is metal. With my other paper cutter, you can see exactly where the cut will be made. Ironically, you'd think it would be easy to cut accurately due to most of the parts being transparent. This one slices somewhere in between the clear plastic part that holds the paper in place (not very well, I must say).  If you only need to cut standard-sized dimensions and don't need a clean cut edge, this will work for you. If you need a paper cutter that is precise, sharp, makes a clean cut, and is reliable, you'll have to keep looking, as I will be doing. I'm still keeping this one solely because I can't find the same model of Exacto paper cutter that I prefer.",4
B0038F1A0S,Bought this to cut food saver bags and it works well for it. Blade replacements are easy enough to find for it as I've owned these before but they were lost during a move. So I'm happy with it.,5
B0038F1A0S,"just as it is indicated, works with my project, it is sharp enough to cut a thick bond paper",4
B0038F1A0S,"I love this trimmer.  it is the second one I have had.  The first one is still useful, but I needed a second one.  There is a wire that run directly down where the blade is going to cut which allows you to place exactly where you want to cut.The wire on my first one after ten years did not have the tension the new one has.  I still use the first one for cutting things that don't need to be perfectly straight.  They are only off by 1/16 pf am inch.  but 1/16 of an inch in making cards look off... after 10 years I feel I got my money's worth out of the first one.  I have several other cutting boards, but this one is my favorite.  I highly recommend it. Cutting blades last a long time.  you can a blade for creasing too.  If there were 10 stars I would give it 10.",5
B0038F1A0S,"This may be a long winded review for a simple item, but I feel it appropriate because of the extremely high level of satisfaction I have with it.Originally purchased Dec 17, 2012, (Yes, almost 10 years ago!) I initially bought it for a project I was planning involving printing 75 candy bar wrappers for my niece's sweet 16 birthday party. The cut was always very accurate thanks to the guide wire on the slide for the blade. Had to actually trim 4 sides of each page I cut as I printed the wrappers two per page. I went ahead and bought a pair of replacement blades with it, which are now lost due to the fact that I only now need to replace that part! I also used it to cut another 75 wrappers for another niece's sweet 16. I've used it many times over the years to cut laminated pictures, and various other small projects. Always with great results. Sometimes I had issues with it leaving behind shavings of paper, or not cutting all the way through because I tried to cut too many sheets at one time. I used it to cut labels for 100 party favor jars for my sister in law's 50th birthday. That was on thick adhesive label paper. (One at a time.) Also did 100 candy bar wrappers for that event as well as over 100 invites on copy paper. I used it in 2019 to cut save the date cards for my wedding, (on card stock which I was able to cut cleanly 2 at a time for 150 cards, again 2 per page) and the wedding invitations, and thank you cards. Approximately 125 for each item. Oh, and I also did candy bar wrappers for my wedding as well. :-)I now use it every month or so to cut service tickets and sale order requisitions for my job. It is still going strong, save for the fact that over the years my heavy handedness has actually worn out the tabs that keep the blade in place as I use the cutter. I now need to keep the blade in place with a piece of tape in storage because it will simple lift out of the track anywhere on the slide due to extreme wear. (Until the replacement blades I just ordered come anyway.) The track itself is also showing signs of wear, and again I attribute that to my own ham hands. I do tend to use what is probably too much pressure, and make two passes to ensure a clean cut.If you're still reading, I decided to post this review because I am happy to see that others who have purchased this item recently are also very happy with it. And I was surprised that it is actually still in production.I recommend this item highly!",5
B0038F1A0S,"At last I have found a paper trimmer that does what I want it to but doesn't cost a fortune! I had an old Fiskar's paper trimmer from many years ago, which I put away in storage because I had stopped crafting for a while and didn't need it. I recently pulled it out of storage, dusted it off, and tried using it because I have embarked upon a new crafting hobby which involves paper cutting. I also pulled out an old Carl's brand personal paper trimmer to try out as well. Unfortunately, despite nice sharp blades on both my old trimmers, I couldn't find a way to line up my paper on either of them to end up with accurate cutting results. (Not sure how I accomplished this in the past...or maybe I never did.)So, based on lots of great reviews, I took the plunge and ordered this new(er) Fiskar's trimmer. It didn't come with any instructions, and I ended up needing to watch the video in this product listing in order to figure out how to swing open the extension arm and then give it that extra little push to secure it into place. Needless to say, I didn't want to accidentally break my new trimmer in the process of figuring out how to correctly use it!I am happy to report that, once I figured out how to position the extension arm, I was  thenable to easily use the trimmer without the need for further instructions. I was thrilled to have it cut through a sheet of my 140 lb. watercolor paper like butter, leaving the cut edge nice and smooth. Mission accomplished!My only concern is that I don't know how long the blade that came with this cutter will last, particularly since its main function will be cutting sheets of watercolor paper to various sizes. I am happy to see that replacement blades are readily available, however, I'm hoping I won't need to purchase them too often. I will update my review if that becomes a problem. For now, this product has earned my 5-star rating!",5
B0038F1A0S,It does what it's intended purpose is,4
B0038F1A0S,"I love this device. It is easy to use and very light compared to the guillotine style paper cutters. I made a denim case that it slips into easily and protects it when I take it along with me. I use this mostly to cut or trim pictures from magazine pages for decoupage and this easily handles a variety of paper thicknesses. For its price, this is a great tool.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I can make precise cuts with this trimmer, and the blades are replaceable. Much better than the one I used previously.",5
B0038F1A0S,I like my cutter but the measuring arm that folds out does not go straight out. It stops at an awkward angle.,4
B0038F1A0S,"I have a longer (12 inch) size but it doesn't fit in my carrying case. This version is much easier to use in a smaller space. I use both of the trimmers, depending on what I'm cutting. Whenever I can, I use the 9 inch one. Also, both of these trimmers use the same blades.",5
B0038F1A0S,"There's a wire running the length of the groove which you place directly over the thing you intend to cut. On mine, I can say that the cut is absolutely consistently just to the left of that line by a hair. So if I want to cut something off, I put it under the wire, slide the cutter, and poof, it's gone.Contrast that to the cutters I had which used wheels (required a lot of pressure and easy to let something slip) or the older models which actually used a similar slider I had but which had a *lot* of play in the the track the slider moved down. This doesn't have that play and yet, at the same time, it doesn't bind up while you are sliding. Now, as to whether you could really cut 10 sheets well with this, I have my doubts. I've done 4-6 sheets of 110lb cardstock with multiple cutting passes, so maybe that's the equivalent, but I can't get over how consistent it can be.One additional thing I want to complement is the surface. Once you've removed the protective film then the surface is something you can easily tape cardboard stops to in order to make sure that a series of cuts all match perfectly. I used that to do cards for a card game and the cards were not as good as die cut commercial cards, but they were indistinguishable for play and nothing I had done previously had achieved that level of consistency.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I cannot recommend this due to the poor design of the swing arm.  As you can see by the pictures posted, the swing arm will not swing out all of the way.  There is a clear plastic nub that sticks up that blocks the arm and I haven't tried forcing it because I don't want to break it..  That is a real detriment for me because I need to use that feature.  I will see if I can contact Fiskars to replace this.The nice features are having rubber tips on the bottom so that it doesn't move around and a good sized cutting surface.  The rail lock is also a nice feature.  It cuts nice when you are not using the swing arm.  This is the 2nd fiskars cutter that I have purchased.  The other one works fine, but it does not have the swing out arm like I had wanted.The lines that are on it are good for measuring your paper that you want to cut.If I can get this fixed by Fiskars, I will update my review, but for now, I cannot recommend this product.",4
B0038F1A0S,"Overall, I've had good luck with this cutter.  It's not perfect for what I do, but it's as good as any other cutter of this style.Cutting paper:I don't cut paper very often, but I'd say 3 or 4 sheets of standard copy paper will cut nicely, and just 1 or 2 pieces of card stock at a time, depending on weight.  This has a shallow blade, so if you're cutting lots of paper and need to cut thick stacks, this cutter is not for you.  You really need a guillotine cutter for that kind of work.What I cut:I use my cutter to cut sheets of vinyl decals, which are pretty thick.  There is a waxy backing paper, the adhesive vinyl, plus a layer of over-laminate.  With such a thick material, I only cut one sheet thickness at a time.  This cutter can handle 2 of my decal sheets, but I like precise cuts and the sheets slide against each other easily, so I just cut one at a time.  I've chosen not to use a guillotine cutter for this work because I want my cuts to be extremely precise, and I want to work quickly.  I have my decal sheets printed with cut guides, which allows me to line up my cuts quickly.BladesI'm often cutting hundreds of vinyl decal sheets at a time, so my blades dull quickly.  I tried the Fiskars cutter because I could buy a 2-pack of replacement blades for half the price of a new cutter.  Previously, I had been using a similar cutter made by Westcott, but I was having trouble finding replacement blades, and I didn't want to buy a whole new cutter every time my blade was dull.The wire guide:I wasn't sure what I thought of the wire guide at first.  I kept getting my sheets hung up on the wire as I slid the sheet along.  Now that I've gotten used to it, I don't get caught up on the wire very often, and I generally like the feature.  The wire is good for eye-balling cuts, but it moves a bit while you're cutting, so don't rely on it for lining up 100% straight and precise cuts.  I have cut guides printed on my material.  My wire hasn't frayed or broken like other users have reported, but with heavy use it has warped a bit.The measuring arm:The swing-arm measuring guide is nice.  If I want the dimensions of something to be precise, I measure it and mark it first.  Just like in woodworking, measure twice, cut once.  For rough eye-balling, the measuring guide on this works just fine.My husband commented that this cutter 'feels left-handed' and that's because I AM A LEFTY, so I use it upside down!  When you're a southpaw, you get used to using items backwards or upside down, and it feels second nature to many of us.  I turned the cutter around for him, and he said, ""Oh, well that's better.""My reasons for 4 stars instead of 5:1.  The wire does eventually warp.2.  The orange blade housing sometimes flies out while you're using it.  It's not a tight fit.  It might fit loose by design so you can easily install a replacement blade, but it's irritating and slows down me down when I'm in a good rhythm.3.  It slides around on your desk or table easily.  I've had other cutters come with foam dots underneath, and it helped.  I've cut my own from craft foam and stuck them to the bottom.  You could also use a non-slip-grip mat under your cutter.",4
B0038F1A0S,Fiskars is the superior brand for cutting tools. I bought a less expensive paper cutter that only lasted a couple of months. Fiskars also sells replacement blades for this product.,5
B0038F1A0S,Really helps with projects cutting even and saving material. So much better than scissors or ruler with exacto knife.,5
B0038F1A0S,"I use a planner that allows me to print my own inserts, and this paper cutter makes it really easy to line up the cut marks. It has a little wire going along the center of the track which makes it easier to see where the blade is going to cut.",4
B0038F1A0S,"I've been using Fiskars paper trimmer for many years, because it's easy to use and always gives a clean cut.",4
B0038F1A0S,I pleased with this.  I've not tried the scoring option 'blade' that I purchased separately.,4
B0038F1A0S,"I have a lot of trimmers and like it the best.  I especially like being able to see the 1/16th inch line.  However the only thing I'd like is to have the cutting line be easier to see, possibly a lot darker or a different color.",4
B0038F1A0S,"My wife needed another paper cutter that was easier to keep in the office than going out to the garage and dragging in our decades old guillotine cutter which will still cut through most things, including light metal and plastics. She just needed the occasional paper trimming for crafts and other uses. It works very well. We've only tried one sheet at a time. I don't think it will work well with more than one or two. We've used it a few times and it worked very smoothly each time. It has a short learning curve when you are used to the old monster cutters. Test it with two or three sheets of paper and you'll be a pro at using it.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I have to cut a lot of paper and cardstock at my job, and this works very well! The blade hasn't gone dull and the base is heavy-duty with rubber feet to prevent sliding. Giving only 4 out of 5 stars due to only being able to cut 3 pieces of cardstock (at most) at a time.",4
B0038F1A0S,I love the Fiscar name. This was a great purchase.,5
B0038F1A0S,"I use this to create craft projects with my daughter, I like it because the blade design is compact and far away from little fingers. Also find it handy when creating shipping labels I have always enjoyed the quality and consistency with Fiskars products. I would recommend this to others.",5
B0038F1A0S,Seems like the cutter removal spot should be at the other end of the slide. It keeps coming off when I am trying to align my cuts.,3
B0038F1A0S,I assumed since it was a Fiskars paper trimmer it would cut smoothly but does not.  And I am only using 65 lb. cardstock.  :(,3
B0038F1A0S,"Be sure to use this on a very solid and flat surface. It's extremely easy to use, and the retractable ruler also helps when dealing with larger pieces.The blade does a great job and easily slices through single sheets of office paper. However, I have noticed that mine isn't 100% aligned with the grid near the top. By the end of a lengthwise cut on a sheet of regular 8.5""x11"" paper, there is a deviation of about 0.5mm. Pretty annoying, but not out of line with expectations at this price point.",4
B0038F1A0S,Good product but it was previously opened.,3
B0038F1A0S,"when the paper cutter was delivered, I noticed that the surface was wrinkled. I cannot smooth it out. I called Fiskars customer service. They referred me to the website. When I tried to make a report, they would not accept one without a product number. I have scoured Amazon for a product number but cannot find one. I guess I am stuck with a defective item. At least it works, just not as I expected from a known brand name and a high price for the item. I thought about returning, but feared it would be the same or worse.",3
B0038F1A0S,"Unfortunately, the blade is very small and became dull after a few trims on, the same day! Very frustrating since I needed it for an urgent project.",3
B0038F1A0S,Excellent cutter. It would have been helpful if the product description described which replacement blades to buy or a link to the correct blade.,5
B0038F1A0S,"I received the trimmer today, and haven't been able to use it because the swing-out arm will not swing out all the way. (See photo 1) There is a little tab on the back (photo 2) that prevents it from opening all the way. I don't want to force it because I think the little tab would break off pretty easily.UPDATE: I read some online reviews that said you have to force the arm into the extended position, so that's what I did. You could tell it stressed the little plastic tab (there's a white crease in it now), but the trimmer is now usable -- and I love it!  So I've changed my rating to a 5. This trimmer cuts so much more smoothly than my previous trimmer. The cuts are clean and accurate. My only issue is that in dim lighting, you can't really see the wire so can't use it to line up your cuts. This isn't a big deal for me, since I normally use the ruler for my cuts, and I usually craft during the day in a bright room.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.NOTE: I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for the promise to file an honest and unbiased review. To meet that obligation I typically use the product for an extended period, no less than two weeks, and under the typical conditions that one might use for a product of this type.",5
B0038F1A0S,Broken but still usable. I'm guessing that's why it was returned in the first place. I got this as a used product on Amazon. I'm so pleased with the product.,4
B0038F1A0S,I was so excited to get this because I do work in different places. First time I used it I thought the fraying would go away. It gets worst and the blade is still new. It does what I need but I get tired of having to remove they frayed pieces.,3
B0038F1A0S,"I use this to cut straight lines through old magazine pages when collaging. It cuts well, but isn't very precise. The cut is always at a slight angle, no matter how carefully I align the top edge of the paper. Nice, sharp blade though, and it does the job well if you don't need exact precision.",4
B0038F1A0S,"While I was able to trim 6-sheets of 20# printer paper, 5-sheets worked more reliably.What I really like about this cutter is its light weight and easy to store out of the way design--I set mine up on edge.Product DOES NOT come with instruction sheet.",4
B0038F1A0S,"I like the size of the cutter. If you're making A2 size cards the arm doesn't need to be extended. The arm can be a bit stiff. My tip is to take an Emery board and gentle file it down just a little as there's not much room there. That helped my cutters arm move a little easier. I'm also trying to figure out a way to drill a hole on top to hang it. Perhaps a hot tool to melt a hole would work. Not sure yet, until I investigate this a bit more. I don't want to ruin my new cutter. It cuts great! I like the wire, so I can see exactly where I'm cutting! Fiskars makes great cutting instruments and these trimmers are not exception.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I've got 3 or 4 cheaper paper trimmers, and have been holding off on buying a better one but I finally bit the bullet and wow, am I glad I did.  Kicking myself for not doing it sooner!  I LOVE the guide wire, it shows you exactly where the cut is going to be made, making it a breeze to get precise cuts.  Gone are the days of having to follow up with the scissors to trim off that extra little strip of white paper after you cut - or worse yet, realize you've taken just a smidge too much off.  It's lightweight and the measuring arm is extendable if you're cutting up to 12"" paper, and easily tucks back in if you're not.  This is *not* a rotary trimmer, so you do need to push down on the cutter, and I was able to cut through 3 pieces of cardstock in one go, although the last one wasn't quite as crisp as I'd like, so I'd say stick with 2.  For regular copy paper it went through 3 with ease.  If you're into paper crafting and have been limping along using one of the cheaper options available, do yourself a huge favor and grab this.  Total game changer for me.",5
B0038F1A0S,"Bought this for work and it's great! No more dealing with janky scissors that would slip sideways during cutting, this thing works great!",5
B0038F1A0S,"I have tried so many trimmers from Single track, Guillotine, To Rotary. I make cards and It's very important to have a straight cut. It looks like the land where trimmers go to die here. I am so over it. I bought this trimmer on sale and its the cheapest one I bought. I got the extra blade with the score blade. It scores beautifully. Straight cuts, straight scores at the correct line. I tried a lot of good name brands and they did not match up to this at all. The arm is hard to extend at first I watched the video and saw there is a push back from the arm when its almost all the way open. But they pushed back through it. I was afraid to break it but no its solid and it opened all the way and you can see  where its cutting. There is a lock down for your papers so they stay in place and they do. I highly recommend buying this trimmer before you waste all the money I did before buying this one. I am on cloud 9 over this find.  A note. There is no centimeters on this trimmer. There is Inch rulers on the top, the bottom and even where the blade runs. All the normal card sizes and photo sizes are marked . This is a fantastic trimmer! unless you need metric",5
B0038F1A0S,"This paper trimmer worked great for a small project I completed this past spring.  I was able to make accurate cuts through a light-weight card paper.  The trimmer is lightweight and easy to use.  However, if I was in need of a cutter that would cut several pages at once, or if i regularly used it for large jobs, I don't think it would be adequate.  There is a better blade that can be purchased and it would definitely be needed for larger jobs.",5
B0038F1A0S,"*** UPDATE - March 25 (2 months down the road) ***Well, I'm sitting at my desk cutting up a bunch of card stock embellishments and sentiments and I notice that the surface of my cutting board is starting to bubble up.  ""OH NO!""  Things were going so good...  Yep, I'm an idiot!!  I probably didn't read all of the material that came with it, otherwise I would have known that there was a protective plastic sheet over the main cutting board area.  Peeled it off, threw it away, and VOILA!Two months of cutting, still on the first blade.  No problems at all and that wire was a GENIUS idea.  I can cut perfectly every time!*** Update Ends ***I'm starting a new hobby, card making, and after watching a bunch of YouTube videos to learn about what I was getting myself in for, I decided that I would need to get a decent paper cutter.  I balked a little at the price since I have a very limited hobby budget, but I had seen several videos of people using this product and it looked like it handled paper cutting with ease and accuracy.  I'M GLAD I SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY!I thought I had owned a paper cutter before...compared to this product I had been cutting paper with a sharp stone attached to a stick with some twine!I got the larger one because you can always fit something smaller on it.  The fold out arm gives you that added accuracy.  And the wire shows you exactly where you're going to cut.  There is also a finger rest to hold down the guide as well as a guide lock.  And the platform has clear and easy to read numbers and grids.I must have spent ten minutes sitting there cutting up some printer paper to try it out and it was actually FUN!",5
B0038F1A0S,I also love the ability to cut larger size paper accurately,5
B0038F1A0S,"Not very sturdy or accurate. It cuts decently well, but hard to align and get a straight cut exactly where you want it every cut was straight but not aligned well. Great for basic needs",3
B0038F1A0S,This worked well for my needs. Cuts printer paper well and with straight lines.,5
B0038F1A0S,"I replaced a Fiskar paper cutter, that I thought was great, with this Fiskar cutter that is a little larger than my other one,  and I love it more.  I like the wire line that makes it easier to line up and cut precisely.  Great cutter.",5
B0038F1A0S,Works great!,5
B0038F1A0S,"I'm using this to accurately cut thermal pads, and it mostly works exactly as I wanted it to. This product would be perfect if it also included SI units. I don't know why imperial is the only system supported when metric is more universally used.",4
B0038F1A0S,Works well for simple but accurate paper cutting,4
B0038F1A0S,This simple cutter is awesome for all my cutting needs.,4
B0038F1A0S,"I ordered this product and Amazon was slow to deliver it, so I went to Office Depot and picked up a Westcott Carbo Titanium.  The Westcott has a scorer, while the Fiskars does not (that I could find), but the scorer on the Westcott does not work well with photo paper - the paper still splits roughly at the seam.  I have had to use a different sharp edge to score the paper for folding.  It is more difficult to find the cutting line with great accuracy with the Westcott, a problem that Fiskars has solved with an extremely accurate line.  I have read other reviews that state that the blade on the Fiskars dulls quickly, but I haven't used it enough to find that out.  So far I much prefer the Fiskars to the Westcott!",5
B0038F1A0S,"This is my review of Fiskars SureCut Paper TrimmerVery happy with this purchase. As a miniature modeler and diorama builder, I have to cut small pieces of paper and card stock; sometimes only 1/4 inch (0.6cm) wide. I need a cutter that can perform precise, straight cuts, and do them efficiently.You can cut paper with a maximum width of 12 inches (30.5cm), and has an extendable arm that accommodates paper with a length of 15 inches (38cm).The cutting blade is sharp, and there is a guard that swings open allowing for easy insertion of the paper. Plus the feet are rubber based, so the cutter will not slide when using.A very good cutter that is perfect for my needs.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I have a job that requires paper cutting but I have hand issues. My job has a paper cutter but its not good for accurate cuts and is dull. This worked well even though I can only cut three papers max. I did do a lot of cutting already (at least 50pages cut into 4ths and 8ths, more than half were cardstock) so I suppose I got a lot out of the blade. The little metal razor came out of the plastic and wouldnt fit back in properly. It is still sharp though. I am a little bit upset it didn't last long and only came with one blade so now I have to buy more already lol but otherwise it's good.",4
B0038F1A0S,The blade barely touches the paper.  You can't cut small pieces because the clear cover isn't sturdy enough to hold the paper down for a precise cut.,4
B0038F1A0S,Cut double folded 110 weight cardstock like a butter knife cuts soft butter. Wire aids alignment for cutting precision. Width allows for sturdy support and multiple sizes.,5
B0038F1A0S,"Nice quality, cuts clean.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I was using a score & cut board for cutting my paper and noticed some of the people I follow were using this paper cutter.  I finally decided to give it a try.  I LOVE IT!My printer does not print ""square"" on the paper and the cutting line makes cutting less of a nightmare.  Perfectly straight every time.  Have had no issues with cutting 3 or 4 sheets of paper at a time.  All are equally cut without being skewed.  Can also cut off the ""white"" edges around printed digital background pages with ease.  No going back to get that tiny bit of white off because I didn't have it lined up perfectly.  This is a life saver for me.It has a locking mechanism to keep the flap held down in place when not in use or when moving it around.  It is also weighted well and has feet that keep it sturdy to the table and does not slip.Worth every penny.",5
B0038F1A0S,Works well. The locking feature is nice to ensure things don't move after aligning.,5
B0038F1A0S,"My local art supplies store sells this same one for like 30 - 40 bucks. Crazy,But as for the product itself, it is very useful if you constantly need to cut standard size copy papers.",5
B0038F1A0S,"I'm often looking to trim photographs and this is just great for our downsized living accomodations.  (I previously had a 24"" wood platform cutter).",5
B0038F1A0S,It looks great and the knife works fine. Too bad the foldout arm won't fold all the way out because the little bump that is supposed to lock it is about twice as high as it should be.  Forcing it would break a lot of plastic. One of these days I'll get out a tool and grind it down. This is the second time in a month I have had to rework something that was sloppily built.  I won't even go into detail about how often documentation doesn't match the product or is just incomprehensible. Not a good sign.,4
B0038F1A0S,I have had several of these over the years. Perfect for fine tuning paper crafts.,5
B0038F1A0S,I should have brought this first!! This cutter is Amazing!!!,5
B0038F1A0S,Safer to use than traditional guillotine cutters. Can square up paper quickly for small or large projects.,5
B0038F1A0S,Sharper and easier to use than the similar product made by WeRMemoryKeepers.,5
B0038F1A0S,Great,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"When engaging in fabric-related projects, the tool of choice plays a crucial role in achieving precise and clean cuts.This cutter has a pleasing shape that fits perfectly in the hand. This is important because a comfortable and well-designed cutter makes it easier to handle during prolonged cutting sessions.The sharpness of the cutter is great because it cuts through fabric smoothly with medium pressure. The sharpness of the blade is pivotal in ensuring that the fabric is cut cleanly and accurately, minimizing fraying and jagged edges.This cutter not only maintains its sharpness but also has the strength and precision to handle multiple layers of fabric simultaneously, saving time and effort.The overall conclusion that this is a ""quality rotary cutter"".  It is a reliable and durable choice for those working with fabric, meeting the expectations of users who prioritize precision, comfort, and efficiency in their cutting tools.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"As with all things I buy on amazon, I did plenty of reading and comparing before buying. In the end, I justified the purchase based on the overwhelming positive reviews and the name. I have been buying Fiskars scissors for as long as I can remember and they never let me down. So, although I had read that the cutter itself is good, the blades not so much, I decided I would try it and if need be I could purchase different blades. And it seems that is what I will be doing. For now, it works fine. It cuts what I need to cut , but sometimes it takes a few tries to get the job done. I am using it mainly for cutting fabric. I am sure cutting paper would go over perfectly, but that is not what I bought it to do. Even on single layers it doesn't make complete cuts all the time I'd say maybe about 70%. I use even pressure and sometimes more pressure than necessary. I had read that the olfa blades are much better, so I will try those out on my cutter, which is great by the way. It feels good in my hand and even though I had thought I would accidently hit the blade retract button with my thumb while cutting, it hasn't happened yet, but it is in the perfect place to get the blade out of the way the moment I finish a cut making it very safe (and when you have rambunctious kids and curious cats, that is always important)So, cons: the blade is not up to par. If I were to review them separately it would have 2 stars.Pros: the cutter itself is ergonomic, is very well thought out, very easy to use, and I feel that my kids and cats are  safe around it when used properly. If I were to rate it separately it would have 5 stars because really it exceeded my expectations.I give it 4 stars overall because the one thing I don't like about it is the one thing that can be and should be changed eventually.In the picture it is hard to see, but there is an indentation after the cut where it kept going, but didn't cut through the fabric.",4
B0C8BQ8R8P,I needed to update my rotary cutter.  I purchased another Fiskars brand and its smooth like butter.  It's slightly short and wider than my previous cutter.  There's nothing like a new cutter.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Nice cutting ability easy grip, great value,perfect size and color!",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"This is my second Fiskars rotary cutter. Easy to use, well-designed, came with a super sharp blade. We'll see how it does when I have to change the blade. Has been redesigned since my purchased my original one about a decade ago. The biggest differences are the shape and the guard is now bright orange instead of gray.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Top-of-the-line,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Just as expected,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Good,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Immediately used it for a project - couldn't find mine. Smooth, clear cutting.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Not as sharp as I was hoping...doesn't cut thru things easily,3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Never having used this and the mat I am over the moon. Never will i return to scissors unless the need dictates. Quality, hand size, safety, sharpness and accuracy was awesome. Even bought the case to assure unknowing hands might want to use.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,I honestly prefer this rotary cutter over regular scissors. I love that they have a guard and it comes very sharp. You can change out the blade and it's not super big or bulky.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Really nice, easy to use rotary cutter.  Now I need to get some replacement blades.",4
B0C8BQ8R8P,Love it!!  Blades are very sharp and had no problem going thru 2 layers of fabric.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"The item is not new; packaging was open, and the blade is dirty. Considering returning it.",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,Absolutely perfect in design quality and ease of use.  This brand does not disappoint.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I own all types of rotary cutters from the simple and less expensive to the very expensive. This Fiskars rotary cutter is the one I go to time after time. It fits nicely into my hand and allows me to cut smoothly without extreme pressure to my wrist or hand. it is light weight with an ease of access to the blade that is unmatched by some of the more expensive brands. And with the push of a button closed for safety. No matter your experience, this is the rotary cutter I would recommend.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Disappointed.  Doesn't feel any better than my Olfa.  The blade that came with it - bad.  Has a bad spot on it.  Would have expected better from Fiskars.,3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"This has been a great tool, the perfect size, weight and sharp enough to get the job done. Not a fan of the crewneck in most tees and this has been the perfect thing to cut t-shirts and make a vneck out of most of tees.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Do you have a lot of cutting to do?  These right here will change your life!  Ribbon, fabric, poster board, Styrofoam, anything!  Including your skin!  Learned that the hard way!  Keep them out of the way.  Makes cutting items quick and easy!  I'll purchase over and over again!",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,So glad i got these!!!! Why have i waited so long!! They are nice and sharp and make cutting straight super easy! Definitely get these!,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Cuts right through fabric,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Love these things and it's like nearly $20 cheaper than at my local sewing shop.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"It cut really well at the beginning but dulled out pretty fast. The blade became wobbly too and I often had to tighten it. Overall, it did what I needed it to do, but I did end up getting a different one!",4
B0C8BQ8R8P,I think I prefer Olfa brand.,4
B0C8BQ8R8P,Fiskars Rotary Cutter.. this one is a lot lighter and smaller than the older stick one.. the handle is hollow where the older ones are a solid heavier plastic and I think they are likely better for cutting thru heavier fabrics. Time will tell on the lighter ones. I use my rotary cutters most days. I do like that it came with a blade and I think the newer guard for the blade is great.,4
B0C8BQ8R8P,Fiskars is a quality brand. Never disappointed with their products.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Only complaint is that it could be a bit sharper. Cant cut through thicker double layered fabric,4
B0C8BQ8R8P,This rotary cutter is very sharp.  I like that the blade is replaceable and it is comfortable to use.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,This is a great tool for cutting heavy and lightweight materials,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Item did as described and I was able to render my thick cotton pants into 2x2"" squares in a short matter of time. The only thing to keep in mind is that the blade is very sharp so retract it the moment you stop using it. I attempted to adjust the cloth and accidentally touched the blade with my free hand. The cut was so clean that I didn't feel it right away.Also, make sure whatever you are cutting on is receptive to accepting the blade without damaging it or making it dull .",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Cutting very well,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Feels good in my hand smooth movement works well so far but I also have not used it that much. That being said I think this was worth the money,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,This cutter works great and is so comfortable in my small hands,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"This little thing is a beast. It sliced through tshirts, jeans and my finger with ease.  Yes, even with the protective guard and warnings I still managed to stupidly cut myself and boy or boy is this thing sharp.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,I was cutting fabric with my Fiskar scissors and it was always a jagged cut but then I found these and they are amazing!! Cuts fabric on a mat like butter and super straight lines - great purchase !!,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Have always cut with scissors.  This tool is amazing.  Nice straight (not ragged) cuts.  Works well on faux leather.  Just bought the Fiskars self-healing cutting mat to use with it.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,I bought this wheel after having a really bad accident with my last one that ended in getting 8 stitches. The handle feels much safer than my old one and the whole thing feels sturdier.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"The packaging can open, with parts and tool loose in outer package.",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,Like the curved handle opposed to the narrow straight handles.  Good size for cutting.  I like it.  Arrived on time.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I love Fiskar products.The blade is very sharp which makes cutting easy. Nice grip, perfect size for my hands. Very sturdy product. Highly recommend this brand and product.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I bought this to cut t-shirts and crafts.  Works great.  Be careful, I nicked myself.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Great cutter! Sharp and precise.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"As a beginner to sewing, I was a bit intimidated by this blade; I knew it was extremely sharp.With a thick ruler and cutting board/mat, hemming my father's pants was a breeze. This cutter made shortening a breeze. I can not cut a straight line even when following the line, so this cutter is invaluable when cutting straight lines.Great purchase so far.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"This is the only rotary cutter i own so i can't compare to others, but I wish it was a little heavier and sturdier. Still with the price I paid, it's good enough for me for now!",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,I like it,3
B0C8BQ8R8P,Can easily cut through 2 layers of wool blend cotton. Easy to use and fantastic quality!,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Time of purchase it was ~$10 for the 45mm. Love how it feels in the hand. It feels like quality but not impressed. Doesn't cut easily. Feels like I have to apply good amount of pressure cutting through the fabric for it to cut perfectly without mishaps. When it does cut perfectly, it looks great. Not sure I'd buy this particular model again",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I use this cutter for cutting my deco mesh while making wreaths. It works well, but a higher level one will probably work better.",4
B0C8BQ8R8P,Comes in handy to cut off excess strings. Etc. Easy to use.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Item is as described,very sharp out of the box ,the blade replacement are kinda expensive but a time saver for sure",4
B0C8BQ8R8P,Works good,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Works OK,4
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Changed the blade once, now the nut holding the blade in place no longer stays put so the blade gets loose and wobbly with just a few cuts. Really hinders productivity.",2
B0C8BQ8R8P,this blade barely cut two layers of quilt cotton. This meant I immediately had to buy addition blades. Very disappointing.,3
B0C8BQ8R8P,For a lot of my cutting projects I had used scissors. I'm now throwing rocks at those scissors because this device made my life so much easier and faster.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"The item that was received was clearly a return as it was out of the plastic packaging so filed for a return.That aside, while the item is functional and felt relatively solid the was a rattling when shaking it.  It turns out that the safety button has some looseness to it.  It is unclear if this rattling is how the tool was designed or if it was broken as this is clearly an open box item.The cutter works, but I don't think it is better that the Olfa.  Have an old Olfa 60mm and it feels better in the hand with no rattling.  Additionally, the Olfa has the size of the blade labeled on the tool so that helps when reaching out for the cutter.",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,This worked fantastic but today I went to put a new blade in it and it literally fell apart in my hand and I noticed the little thin washer piece is badly bent.  The cutter hasn't been dropped or mis-used so I guess that piece is just not hefty enough for daily use.  Fortunately when my mom passed I inherited all her sewing gear so I was able to proceed with my project using her cutter.,4
B0C8BQ8R8P,This is my first rotary cutter and it works like a dream! Good bye scissors!!,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Works great, too small like the bigger one, but would be good for precision cutting! Feels safe, is sturdy!",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Not long term tool, not made well.",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,I like how easy this item is to use and how easy it is to replace the blade if needed. I like that no real pressure is needed to cut the items I had (mostly cloth and chipboard). I  use this mostly for scrapbooking.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"My son is in elementary school, and they had a program where they needed to be birds.  The call went out, as it seems to do, to parents to cut feathers from felt.  The school provided a paper template.  My wife is much better at this sort of thing than I am, so she got a lot of different colors of fabric, and started using the rotary cutter to cut out the feathers.This cutter was fantastic for the job.  She could easily cut through 3 layers of fabric without any trouble.  She has had carpal tunnel surgery, so we were not sure how this would help.  This cutter was perfect.One note:  My wife found that you need something hard under the fabric or else you run the risk of cutting grooves into the underlaying material.  For instance, when we started cutting on our table, there were initially small marks on the table where the cutter blade had passed through the fabric and actually cut the table a little.  Our table isn't super nice (2 small kids, we know better than to have nice things LOL), so it wasn't an issue.  She put a cutting board under the fabric and that solved the problem perfectly.Overall, the product does exactly as it says it will do, and does it very well.  We cut about 200 feathers, and only used the one blade that came with it.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,All of my rotary cutters with the exception of one are Fiskars! It fits my hand well and I prefer a rotary cutter shaped like this as opposed to the straight/stick formation. It's hollow so it's lightweight and for me these style grips are easier to press/cut with and there's less risk of my hand slipping onto the blade. Easy to use and I like the push button to engage the blade being along the top.,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Not for nothing, but Friskar is a superb company. Known for thier quality cutting tools.I received this product that was completely separated from it cardboard backing and the plastic part that covers the item.The blade has oil all over it. It was lose is the shipping box.. three pieces. The cutter and the packaging thrown in a box. Seriously?I didn't pay for a used product and I'm sure Friskar wouldn't be too happy if they knew their products were sold like this.I have no idea how this product is supposed to work as it's my first purchase of such item as it appears it was used. I have no idea how long it was used for or what was cut with it prior to me receiving it.Seller is more interested in shipping a product out in pieces and receiving payment rather that customer satisfaction.This is atrocious.Update 01/31/24** DON'T BUY!!! **On top of this arriving used, thrown into a box and sent to me, I tried using it and it's as dull as it gets! It doesn't cut anything.Whomever used it and returned it, ruined it.The seller shipped this out to me in such horrendous condition it's sickening.No thanks!Buyer be aware, be very aware!",2
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I got the 45mm cutter and I am really happy with my purchase. The blade is sharp, cutting is really smooth and you dont have to apply a lot of pressure even for thick fabrics. The open/close mechanism is also helpful, especially when putting away or storing the tool.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Dulled out after a few uses,3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Usually, I try and lead off with the good points about a product, but this product really annoyed me.  I bought Fiskars because they are the best, or used to be.  Not so much today.  I've waited a few days to write this review to be more objective.  The blade wobbles.  No matter how tight you get it, it wobbles and this makes straight cuts impossible, even against a thick aluminum ruler.  The blade retracts into the handle as a safety measure.  Unfortunately, I have slightly larger than average hands.  Just holding the device bumps the retract button and bam! it retracts during a cut.  The blade is sharp and it jumped when this happened and I nicked myself with it.  To back up a bit, I bought a brand-new self-healing mat on which to make my cuts and I'm cutting along a template taped to the cloth.  My wife hearing me extol the virtues of this cutting tool offered that I was pressing down too hard.  I tried using less pressure which solved the jumping into retract mode some of the time but did not eliminate it but introduced that the cloth was not cut completely through on one pass.  In both of these scenarios, I was pushing the rotary cutter forward.  So, we tried pulling the cutter backward.  This resolved most of the accidental retraction of the blade instances, but not all.  This approach had the side effect of not being able to easily see where the blade was and the wobble in the cuts became more pronounced.  In the end, the cloth wasted was worth more than the rotary cutter.  I tossed it into a back corner or a drawer, probably never to see daylight again and went back to using a sharp #11 blade and an X-Acto handle, straight cuts, no retraction of the blade, and I could see everything I was doing.On the positive side, I did like the color of the rotary cutter.",2
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I used these immediately after receiving then from Amazon to cut a bunch of fleece rectangles to make neck gaiters.  A couple of things:PROS:* Cuts with ease, love my new sharp blade! I was very happy to toss my cheap old rotary cutter in the trash.* Handle is easy to hold* Easy to lock and unlock the blade for safety and storageCONS:* I am left handed and the blade is positioned on the left side of the guard, so it is hard for me to see if I am cutting on the line* Even when trying to cut with my right hand, I need to position my face pretty close to the cutter to see exactly where I am cutting, because the guard blocks the view of the blade from above and I can't tell where the center is.  I'm in my 20s with good vision and was using good lighting and I still had a hard time.Not a big deal but kind of annoying:* The blade comes a little greased, so all the fleece lint got stuck to the blade and in between the guard and the blade, which decreased its motility, but it was easy to detach and clean.If I could see the blade from above these would get 5 stars.  But overall I do like them for the price.",4
B0C8BQ8R8P,The product package was opened. So I returned it. Because of the type of item it was. The blade maynot have been new,3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"Fiskars has a reputation of making superlative cutting products of all sorts, and this is certainly no exception. I have a Fiskars lawn mower, a Fiskars hatchet, and several pair of Fiskars scissors, so when I needed a rotary cutter, of course I chose a Fiskars.While these are designed for cutting cloth, I use mine for something slightly different- cutting rubber bands for slingshots! Latex rubber and things like Therabands are very difficult to cut smoothly and accurately with most cutting instruments. The rubber twists, stretches, and refuses to cut. But with a metal straightedge and this cutter, it's trivially easy (see photo).One feature that particularly appealed to be about this cutter was the easy to use self-storing blade- something that's important if you tend to be one of those people (like me) who always manages to find the sharpest part of a tool to grab. Push the lever on the back of the cutter, and the blade pops into position for cutting. Finish your cut and push the button on the side, and the blade immediately retracts inside. It's all one handed, which means the blade never has to be exposed unless you're actually cutting. A great little tool for cutting fabric, photographs, or even rubber slingshot bands ;-)",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,The package was already open and the blade was very dull.  It looks like it's been used before being sent to me.  Very unhappy.Update: It popped apart in 3 weeks.  Became too dull to finish project.  Wish I could make it one star,2
B0C8BQ8R8P,"If you want perfect cuts, every time, this cutter is for you! I am using it to cut toner foil, and it makes a clean, perfect cut every single time I use it! I LOVE the fact that the blade is ""retractable"" so that it is safe to use, and I feel it keeps the blade clean and sharp as well. I have already recommended this to others. And I TRUST the Fiskars brand, for scissors to this rotary cutter too! I think you'll be very impressed with it. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again, should I need to!",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,Great product and was delivered promptly,5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"When received, this product was in a blister pack that had already been opened - peeled back enough to easily remove the cutter.  The blade was covered (both sides) with some sort of oil.  That said, the cutter is sharp enough to cut a finger, which happened when I was cleaning it for use -- something I did not expect to have to do.",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I like the product itself, but whomever came up with the packaging needs to find another line of work.  The plastic wrapping around each individual piece is hard and solid. The problem is, the very thin, flexible and soft material of the protectors attaches itself to the hard plastic wrapping. If you try to open it the normal way, you will slice or cut into the material of the protector, making it useless. Did this, very carefully, but still it cut into the protector. Tried cutting the hard board material around the plastic, and it hurt my hand to even do so.My advice - do not touch the area near the protectors but cut from the top slightly into the hard plastic wrapped around the protector. You'll have to rip the slots open manually. I love product but opening it wasn't worth the time or effort.",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I have used this style rotary cutter for many years. However, I've had to replace them often as they break. I guess it has to do with the locking mechanism since that is where they break. This one still locks and it still is kind of forceful when you release the blade back into the lock position. However, this one feels like a better quality of plastics. I sure hope so since it fits my hand so much better than other brands and styles.",5
B0C8BQ8R8P,"The cutter was loose in the amazon bag , almost as if it was used. No protective plastic cover, Only the cardboard backing  It appears to be in working order. I will have to check on that before returning",3
B0C8BQ8R8P,"I cut my finger (100% user error), and it was so sharp I didn't even feel it. Goes smoothly through fabric layers too. Decently ergonomic. A+",5

B000UVMNF4,These are decent kid scissors.  I do wish I would have chosen the colors because the picture shows green and blue and my son ended up getting pink.  Other than the color they are normal kid friendly scissors that are easy to use.,5

B000UVMNF4,"Took off one star because we were supposed to receive green and blue per the listing description but received yellow and pink. Scissors work well. Heads up to parents, although these are safety scissors, they cut really well and could injure your child since they're not plastic blades. Our kids are ambidextrous and use the scissors with both hands but can't speak on how well they work for left handed people.",4
B000UVMNF4,I bought this for my kids and they love it. It teaches them how to cut properly without the fear of them getting hurt and is very easy for kids to use.,5
B000UVMNF4,"They are decent scissors for a young child just learning to cut but I am very disappointed with the colors I received. I really didn't search into it enough and I didn't realize they could send you whatever colors they felt like sending but I have a 5 year old boy who wanted blue so I thought I was getting blue and green bc that was the main picture. But what we received was bright pink and yellow. So he will have to go with yellow as he is adamant that he does not want pink but is also pretty upset that he didnt get a blue pair. It may seem stupid, but 5 yr olds are pretty particular about what they want and most parents of 5 yr olds will vouch for me on this. Either way it is what it is and my son will have to work with what we have.",3
B000UVMNF4,Work good of good quality. Very safe round ends.,5

B000UVMNF4,"Great second step scissors for little hands. I started with plastic safety scissors, to practice grip and just show my 1yo son what it would be like to use real scissors.  They did not cut much but they served their intended purpose.  These dont cut much more than those without help.  If i hold the paper taught he can cut independently  but has no way of cutting with these if he only holds the paper with one hand and the scissors with the other. Still he likes them very much and we use them ( with support)  often. We will likely keep these for a year before graduating to a more serious pair of actually sharp (as in the blades not the tips) scissors",5
B000UVMNF4,"This is a real value!! The small price tag is outstanding for these 2 pair of children's scissors! These scissors are extremely high quality and have been perfectly designed for use by children. My grandson is practicing his scissor cutting while getting ready for kindergarten and these scissors are perfect for this use. The handles on these scissors can be used by either right or left-handed kids and the bright color of each handle is appealing to young scissor users. Additionally, the handles are very comfortable for new scissor users as they work to master scissor skills. I definitely recommend these scissors and will purchase them again when my other grandkids are preparing for kindergarten.",5
B000UVMNF4,"Bought these for the toddler because she likes to do arts and crafts.Has led to literal seas of paper strewn across her floor and has spilled into the other rooms. Every single day we clean these oceans of paper up and every single day they reappear.We took the paper away and only one pair of the scissors. She had planned ahead and hidden the other pair before we could get to them.In retaliation she has gone after the mail, her barbies, the cats, anything these weapons of mass destruction can take down.Pretty colored handles though.",4

B000UVMNF4,THEY WORK!,5
B000UVMNF4,"Needed small safe scissors for kids and these are stuck closed, feel rusted or just poorly put together. Scissors should open and close pretty easily but these don't. I would return. I should return them, but I probably won't bother because they are cheap. Don't buy these though.",1
B000UVMNF4,10/10 would not run around with scissors,5
B000UVMNF4,I bought these because I thought they were the same ones I had before that look just like these. They are close to the old pair but they feel a little less well made. The plastic is smooth and the tip is rounded. Great for kids. But I do not think they will last as long as my last pair. Also I found this same set at the store a few days later for much cheaper. So maybe I am just mad at myself.,4
B000UVMNF4,School supply must have. Good price,2
B000UVMNF4,"These were bought for my nephew because he is left handed. The scissors cut fine, but I was hoping for some with roomier holes for his thick fingers.

B000UVMNF4,"Ordered these scissors because the two pack was listed as one blue and one green, my kids' two favorite colors.

B000UVMNF4,"I was not expecting a lot of quality from an inexpensive scissor like this one, but I was disappointed that it last not even a day. Unfortunately I cannot leave a feedback to the vendor. I would rather talk to him directly instead of writing a bad review. I am thinking if is is worth taking the time and driving to an UPS store to return a $3 product.Update: I was given the option to replace or have a returnlees refund. Great policy. Although I was not satisfied with the quality of the product, I was really happy with the return options. Thank you! Increasing my review from 1 to 3 stars.",3
B000UVMNF4,Great buy! Works great have had them for almost a year no issues!,5
B000UVMNF4,"So, if you're expecting one pair of right-handed scissors and one pair of left-handed scissors, like the product name would suggest, prepare to be disappointed: This is a set of TWO RIGHT-handed scissors.While it's technically true that one can HOLD them in one's left hand, the orientation of the blades is such that they will not cut properly.In any case, not particularly great in any other regard either compared to other name-brand kids scissors which I thought were both easier-to-use, more comfortable, and also more honest in their advertising.",1

B00OBC4CWK,"Shipped without additional packaging, which for me is a pro.88 sticks in an 85 stick package, so that's great!.44 inch size (as measured by electronic calipers) works great in my Stanley glue gun that's supposed to use .45 inch sticks.Definitely not crystal clear. In the picture you can see the purge glue from my old generic sticks has a yellow tint and bubbles from fast extrusion, but otherwise pretty clear. These adtech crystal clear sticks have a good clear ""color"", but they cool cloudier than I'd expect from something called crystal clear. I left a seal attached to one so you can see the clarity, or lack thereof and judge for yourself if it meets your needs. I don't need it clear, but I'm a little sad it doesn't live up to its name.I only ran one stick through my gun, but the adhesion seems about the same as my generic sticks. So, really well on rough cardboard, decently on metal.  It stuck hard enough to pull the coating off of part of one of the wax seal stamps I tested with, and I didn't even know they were coated. I anticipate going through about half the box in the next couple months, so I'll update if they have any real issues with adhesion. So far they perform as anticipated.",5
B00OBC4CWK,These work great!,5
B00OBC4CWK,"I will not buy anything other than this brand again. They have the most strength, and are great for any kind of project. I am a huge crafter, so I have been through a lot of different brands of glue sticks, these hands down are the best.",5
B00OBC4CWK,Nice quantity for the price.,5
B00OBC4CWK,absolutely love having a large quantity of glue sticks! I am still working on this box! They work well with my glue gun.  It's just a Walmart glue gun.,5
B00OBC4CWK,Muy bueno la verdad siempre lo uso con mucha frecuencia en pasamano de escaleras y rodapie,5
B00OBC4CWK,Good,5
B00OBC4CWK,I love using these glue sticks over any other glue stick,5
B00OBC4CWK,They work,5
B00OBC4CWK,This was a good buy loved it lasted a long time,5
B00OBC4CWK,Work as expected will order again.,5
B00OBC4CWK,These glue sticks are wonderful.  I have tried others and the other ones do not hold well.  These really help things stay.  Thanks.  Love the quality and strength.  Thanks.,5
B00OBC4CWK,I shouldn't have to buy glue sticks for some time. This was a good value so I ordered the larger quantity,5
B00OBC4CWK,I use a lot of glue sticks and buying in bulk was worth the price!,5
B00OBC4CWK,"I'm writing my review because the item was glue sticks and that's what I got. However, it said it would ship to me in 4 days, I ordered on the 16th, and they arrived on the 29th. cutting that close I would have gone and got it myself if I knew it was going to take this long. ugh annoying but great product.",4
B00OBC4CWK,Great for craft projects,5
B00OBC4CWK,Wounderful glue . just what i needed,5
B00OBC4CWK,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Battery powered hot glue gun doesn't have enough moxie to push out this glue at its low temperature. You need a high-powered hot glue gun to get the stuff to melt.,4
B00OBC4CWK,"I seem to use a lot of glue sticks for various projects. I find the smaller packages are expensive, so I was glad to find this large box of glue sticks that will last me a lot longer than a small package.",5
B00OBC4CWK,"Good price, great product",5
B00OBC4CWK,"Cuz when u need glue ya get glue.Typical universal glue sticks. They do the job expected of them. Wont run out for a while. Look into the cordless glue gun with rechargeable stand. Best purchase yet! Hint:  if the stand is sliding when u try to remove glue gun, gl<e the stand down to your work surface. When finished, remove stand and glue comes right off.",5
B00OBC4CWK,"Still using the box; if you find yourself using a lot of hot glue, purchase. it's good in the long run",5
B00OBC4CWK,Great pricing and super fast arrival to my door! Highly recommend this vendor.,5
B00OBC4CWK,"I have a Ryobi 18v glue gun and these work great with it. Once hot, the glue applies easily and hardens quickly. Some glue sticks slow set, not these,. All depends what you want. Industrial size / industrial strength and having a large box makes it even better as you don't run out in the middle of a show when you are having to do last minute costume repairs. I just bought my second box and will buy again after this next production.",5
B00OBC4CWK,"Get one of those high power hot glue guns and have the time of your life. I built a cardboard canoe and this stuff was perfect. If you're a crafter I suggest buying, its nice to know you wont run out for a long time.",5
B00OBC4CWK,"I absolutely love these glue sticks! They work exceptionally well for our countertop templates, providing a strong and reliable hold that meets our needs perfectly. Additionally, I've found that this is the best place to purchase them at the most competitive price. The combination of their effectiveness and affordability makes them an indispensable part of our project toolkit.",5
B00OBC4CWK,"Long hot glue sticks- perfect for every teacher. Works as expected, and was a great value at the time of purchase. Will purchase again.",5
B00OBC4CWK,Box of glue sticks does it's job.,5
B00OBC4CWK,Good value a little stringy,4
B00OBC4CWK,As advertised,5
B00OBC4CWK,GOOD,5
B00OBC4CWK,"I bought this box of glue like forever ago and threw it out because i could never use it. It was too much, and didn't really serve a purpose aside from name brand adhesives.I have since learned my lesson and regret tossing that mostly full box of this specific glue, and wish this company could offer freight or higher bulk orders becuase 90% of my needs require quantities, rather than adhesion.Name brand glue sticks stick very well, but so does this with surface prep. Inner matrix or fillers like paper towels vastly improve strength and water protection.Lastly, making temporary water and dust seals usually requires them to be remove able. Glossly surfaces will do an awesome job at keeping this glue in place while you want it there.Also great for keeping mason jars safe.Really great stuff!!",5
B00OBC4CWK,Second time purchasing and it has taken for ever to deliver and when it was finally the day to receive it... i got a message that approval was needed because it would be delayed another 2 weeks. It is a great price and good quality the only bad thing is that its delayed again!,3
B00OBC4CWK,I use a lot of hot glue and did not want to pay way to much buying a few sticks here and there. These are good quality sticks for me and do the jobs I need just fine. Will buy again when the time comes.,5
B00OBC4CWK,I'm a fursuit maker so I go through ALOOTTT of hot glue i probably go through more in a month than the average person does in a lifetime so being able to buy this in bulk is a life saver!! The quality is good aswell!,5
B00OBC4CWK,Good product good price,5
B00OBC4CWK,"If you've never used a hot glue gun before, you'll be amazed how quickly you go through a glue stick. This is a great value for the amount of glue sticks you get and they work as expected.",5
B00OBC4CWK,Perfect size for my glue gun,5
B00OBC4CWK,Not easily melted,3
B00OBC4CWK,"We have three crafty girls, they take after their parents, and love to make things. They go through hot glue like it's going out of style. Anything from using as intended to making puddles filled with crayon bits. Such a large quantity at a great price has allowed us to not fret as much when it is ""wasted"" and instead gives them freedom to fuel their creativity - while still leaving some for us adults when it's needed on our projects.Would buy again without hesitation.",5
B00OBC4CWK,I'm glad I purchase this many as I didn't realize how much I would be using my new glue gun!,5
B00OBC4CWK,I love using these on my IOD (IRON ORCHID DESIGN) moulds for crafting.,5
B00OBC4CWK,"I use glue sticks to fix almost everything.  for people who thinks duct tape is king,  well,  get you some quality glue sticks and melt it with a handheld small torch .  it really holds great if You do it right.Great deal on a box of quality glue sticks .  85 full sized glue sticks that sticks pretty good after melting the item with a small torch.  clean the area your working on with rubbing  alcohol to clean up any oils and dirt ,  then with a small torch,  heat the glue stick about an inch from the glue stick end.  let the heated glue drop all over and around the area your fixing .  then most importantly.  let it set for 5 mins without moving item.  if you move the item even a centimeter,  the bond will not be strong.  so remember to let sit completely still.  then you should have a strong glue stick bond that is really on there.",4
B00OBC4CWK,Nice glue sticks,5
B00OBC4CWK,We used for a project and worked great. Will buy again,5
B00OBC4CWK,"This is my 7th box in 4 years. It works great for most things. Will take 24 hrs to really ""set"". For permanant use. Use this to hold a run and between, hot glue add a gorilla type or contact cement glue. Pvc glue expands when set so plan ahead  Keep the hot glue and pvc glue runs separate. Best I could explain.",4
B00OBC4CWK,I craft a lot and these will last for months. The better the stick the less it takes making your projects look better with less drip and webbing.,4
B00OBC4CWK,Good product,5
B00OBC4CWK,I really like these glue sticks.  They have a really nice adhesion once dry.  I would highly suggest you purchase these for your craft needs.,5
B00OBC4CWK,I use them to glue up my Christmas lights.,5
B00OBC4CWK,"Great price, great product, and so easy to use!!",5
B00OBC4CWK,met all expectations both with delivery time and product quality,5

B00OBC4CWK,"Good quality, nice to have in bulk for all craft projects",5
B00OBC4CWK,This product is excellent when it comes to quality and it adheres items together very well.,5
B00OBC4CWK,These sticks work well and were reasonable priced,4
B00OBC4CWK,Much cheaper than your local hardware or big box store and just as good.,5
B00OBC4CWK,"Box had 97 sticks,  but I order from the other options section and for 2 bucks less I got 97 sticks in a damaged box (as described)  the truth is the box was damaged when stickers from the previous delivery where removed, no wholes no wrinkles just peeled stickers. I have no idea if I got 5 pounds but I really don't care, my daughter has a school project and is making 35 paper flowers she has glue for a long time now. In regards to how it drys I'm attaching some pictures but mines so far drys clear. We have no complaints and I'm glad I got it!",4
B00OBC4CWK,"Initially, I was shopping on HomeDepo and this item was sold out and cost a couple of dollars more. I was searching on eBay and Amazon and found out it was cheaper to buy it from Amazon. It's better to buy in bulk quantities. These work pretty well for my PDR and easy to use. Will come back for more!",5
B00OBC4CWK,"way cheaper and way bigger..if u can wait for it to ship to u,this is a no brainer.A little planning ahead can save u so much versus going to the craft store because your out .You get a huge amount of big sticks",5
B00OBC4CWK,I bought these 2 years ago and I only have about 10 left. They melt beautifully clear and when in their cold form are bendable and not hard like cheaper glue sticks can be.,5
B00OBC4CWK,These glue sticks are strong. I will be ordering more for my Arts & Crafts.,5
B00OBC4CWK,!sticks glue quality Best,5
B00OBC4CWK,They fit my cordless glue gun. The glue is very strong. I highly recommend this glue for the price it worked out well,5

B00OBC4CWK,"I've been using these for years to support silicone mold making, but suddenly this last batch is causing cure inhibition in my materials. I don't know if they changed the composition of these on purpose or they became contaminated with something, but the batch I got is not the same as they used to be. Now useless for the purpose I bought them for.",2
B00OBC4CWK,I used this in a hot glue gun to melt the stick into a sticky melted glue puddle to stick things together.  It works fine but watch for sticky hot strings and for drips that burn your skin.  Children under 10 probably should not use this with a hot glue gun.,5
B00OBC4CWK,Works as expected,5
B00OBC4CWK,"Never thought I'd actually have a favorite glue stick, but this one is it.  The hold is very strong, the sticks are a full 10 inches long, it dries clear and is a good value for the money when bought in bulk such as this.  To my knowledge, glue doesn't go bad, so with ever-rising prices these days with just about everything, this 170-count box is a deal.  Highly recommended.",5
B00OBC4CWK,They get the job done. I craft a lot so I bought this big box. Dry kinda cloudy. Not as strong hold as gorilla glue- but knew that up front.,4
B00OBC4CWK,"I read one review that said that they made the sticks shorter and raised the price, so I was a little worried. But my order just now came in, and the sticks are exactly the same size as my previous order about a year and a half ago (10 inches long). Maybe that person got sent a different product by mistake? Anyways, I just thought I'd share this with future buyers. My friend uses these for craft projects. and she says they are way better than the other sticks she has used in the past, so I just ordered this box that just came in.",5
B00OBC4CWK,My daughter loves to craft and the hot glue gun is her go too tool for crafting. I was getting tired of being asked to pick up more hot glue from the store every week. This item should prevent that from happening for a awhile. My daughter loves that they are way longer then the normal ones I had been getting. She says they work lol ke a glue stick should. I am happy,5
B00OBC4CWK,I do a lot of crafting for myself.  I love the deal I got.,5
B00OBC4CWK,"it would not melt in my gun,  i had other glue sticks melt fine..but these will not melt. Update  it does melt in a new gun.  as for my old gun it works with other hot glue sticks just not this one.  so 4 stars.",4
B00OBC4CWK,I use a lot of hot glue.  This fits box/produce was great.,5
B00OBC4CWK,I was hoping glue would be clear when set but it is cloudy,4
B00OBC4CWK,Love them so much,5
B00OBC4CWK,Really good buy on glue sticks.,5
B00161S2RK,"Works better than the original! Figured out how to put it into the paper cutter the correct way and it cut our photos beautifully after that. Appears longer than the original, but that could only help I'd imagine. Good price considering how much these things help us out with cutting photos.....I couldn't imagine cutting them by hand with scissors!",5
B00161S2RK,"Works and fits great. For those that were saying it's too big or doesn't move easily on the track, try turning it around. That's what I had to do and it worked perfectly. The blade type is listed on the back of the paper cutter, although it was hard for me to find as it's part of the plastic. I noticed that the blade is bigger and longer than the original one the cutter came with.",5
B00161S2RK,"The Fiskars Cutter is a great tool for cutting a fine edge on heavier card stock or whatever else you need to cut. I fequently use 140# watercolor paper and this cutter has been an excellent way to get a fine, straight edge. I used it for several months occasionally but the cut edges were starting to lose their crispness so I was happy to discover this tiny replacement blade. Very easy to fix: the old one snaps out, new one snaps in and the precision cuts are back once more. Wish I had done it sooner!",5
B00161S2RK,"Was not happy with non-Fiskars blades (got dull quickly, jammed while cutting).Fiskars blades remain sharp, cut smoother and remain sharp longer than the competition.",5
B00161S2RK,I use my paper trimmer all of the time. Finding replacement blades locally has been a chore. They arrived on time. Worked as expected. Fit my trimmer perfectly and the price was on point.,5
B00161S2RK,"I have the memory keeper cutter and bone folder. This blade doesn't work in that. The blade is good but it didn't work for that. I love all my other fiskars products, and I have a lot of them!",4
B00161S2RK,Nice replacement blade and paper scorer set.,5
B00161S2RK,"I use and love many of the Fiskers products. These Fiskers replacement cutting blades are one of them. They stay sharper longer than the other brands. They are easy to use, made of durable steel and cut more than just paper. I cut photos and cards stock with them all the time. I'm a pretty heavy crafter and I need reliability. I use these blades in all of my cutters. There is nothing more annoying than cutting something and it leaves tiny little paper fragments all along the cut edge. Then I have to take extra time away from the project I'm working on. I have to use my scissors to carefully cut off the frayed looking edge that's left. Fiskers gives you a nice clean edge every time. And when the time comes that I do need a replacement I always keep a spare on hand. We'll worth the money!",5
B00161S2RK,I have several of the older Fiskars portable paper trimmers that needed new blades.  After ordering the wrong type I finally found the ones that are a perfect fit.,5
B00161S2RK,"In all the years I've had my Fiskars cutter, I don't think I've ever replaced the blade until now.  It was long past time, but I didn't realize how far past time until I used one of these new blades.  I wish I'd ordered these years ago, lol.  The cut was so smooth - not just in how clean the cut was, but the blade moved along the track smoothly too.  I didn't realize how my dull blade was just making everything about the cutter horrible.",5
B00161S2RK,Fit my cutter perfectly. Easy to snap in place.,5
B00161S2RK,Great Quality,5
B00161S2RK,So pleased to find these replacements after losing the original!,5
B00161S2RK,Just what w wanted,5
B00161S2RK,These are always a great product. FAST shipping and cut like butter.,5
B00161S2RK,"As expected, this item was the correct replacement for the cutting blade in my paper cutter and works well.",5
B00161S2RK,Purchased this to replace my existing used on.  Hope this lasts longer than (being titanium) than the original.,4
B00161S2RK,"I was pleased that they fit my trimmer, and I have extras when I need them.",5
B00161S2RK,As described.,5
B00161S2RK,"Good value, better than Michaels, I do many crafts, these are a known brand to use with my machine.",5
B00161S2RK,I didn't even know you could order these!!  What a nice discovery!  Quick delivery.,5
B00161S2RK,Just what I needed,5
B00161S2RK,"I have an old Fiskars personal cutter (pre-2000) that has no model indicator - just a patent number on the bottom. I ordered the most popular (and readily available) replacement blades, but they didn't work. Apparently, in recent years, Fiskars updated the cutter to have slots to firmly hold the blade in place and prevent it from falling out when turned upside down :D Mine doesn't have that safety feature, so the new blades (Style I) absolutely won't work with my cutter (even though they look really similar). Now that I have the correct blades, my cutter works like new. OH!!! A bonus feature I found is that you can use these similar to a rotary cutter when pushed up against a straight edge! Now I can cut my really large pieces of paper like a pro! WooHOO!",5
B00161S2RK,Perfect for what I need them for,5
B00161S2RK,the scoring blade doesn't work.  There's no blade in it.,3
B00161S2RK,The design on these are a bit different than the original blade that comes with the cutting board but it works. I prefer the original design but it gets the job done.,4
B00161S2RK,Fiskars is superior for cutting tools.,5
B00161S2RK,So good to be able to make nice cuts again!!,5
B00161S2RK,"I admit that I will use a blade until it tears instead of cutting. These replacement blades work great, and ordering them is simple.  I just have to remember...",5
B00161S2RK,These are the only blades that function properly.The delivery was very good.,5
B00161S2RK,"why don't they last longer than they used to? Cheaper made, I guess. Once you get the reasonably priced trimmer, you find out that the blades are not so good when you replace them. I'm looking for generic blades.",3
B00161S2RK,"With the new cutting blade, paper cuts easily and no tearing or jagged edges.",5
B00161S2RK,Works great.,5

B00161S2RK,Easy to replace existing blade and cuts card stock easily. I use this to make greeting cards.,5
B00161S2RK,Have needed a replacement for a while. Thrilled to find this. Easy to replace,5
B00161S2RK,"So far I've cut hundreds of pictures, shipping labels and all other kinds of plain and premium paper and it glides through clean cuts on the first swipe every time. Side not, the last replacement blade I purchased held up under heavy use for nearly 8 months, so we'll worth the purchase",5
B00161S2RK,My blades were getting very bad and I'm glad I got the Fiskers brand as a replacement.,5
B00161S2RK,"cuts okay, but, size and cutting is not a duplicate to the original.",3
B00161S2RK,These work great and are cheaper than at the local store.,5
B00161S2RK,The Fiskars paper cutter is one of my most useful tools. These blades seem to last forever so I will stick to the name brand rather than get the cheap knock-offs.,5
B00161S2RK,"I have had the paper cutter for years and finally needed a new blade. These things last a long time, but you will eventually need a new blade. Two come in the package so I will be good for  many more years (unless I misplace the package)! They cut heavy photo paper as well as regular paper.",5
B00161S2RK,They don't last very long but do any of them? I don't know.,3
B00161S2RK,I've had my papercutter for years and I really put it to the test. I'm grateful that Fiskars continues to make the replacement blades. They are so easy to take off and put the new ones on.  They are sharp and work very well.,5
B00161S2RK,I have bought these several times. Great blade replacement.,5
B00161S2RK,I use both the scoring and the cutting blades.,5
B00161S2RK,Fiskar blades to replace the blades when they get dull. Teachers using them will be able to have sharp blades all year.,5
B00161S2RK,Nice smooth cuts.,5
B00161S2RK,I had to return these but it was all my fault.  I didn't realize I had a Triple Track trimmer until these arrived and I noticed they looked different than the one currently on my trimmer.  This is the first time I've ordered replacement blades for my new trimmer so lesson learned.  Style I is what you need for the Triple Track.,5
B00161S2RK,We have used these replacement blades for years for our Fiskars paper cutter and always find them reliable for cutting copy paper and card stock.,5
B00161S2RK,What I liked most was that they came in a pack of two. They are the perfect replacement for my Fiskers cutting board. They are sharp however if you are cutting a lot of paper they will get dull quickly.,5
B00161S2RK,These paper cutters work great.They cut through 2 layers of Cardstock at the same time.,5
B00161S2RK,Works for me,5
B00161S2RK,I am into crafting and scrapbooking and need my paper cutter to make clean cuts so when it started to snag a bit I was glad to find the replacement blades on Amazon.My ordering and delivery was quick and easy and on time. Reasonably priced too. They Snap into place easy and I am making clean cuts again! Saved  time & gas from driving around town to find in stock.,5
B00161S2RK,"This is a heavily used item, and the replacements are just as sharp as original. Worth the money!!",5
B00161S2RK,Would have been a waste to have to replace the entire device when all that was needed was a new blade. Simple to install.,5
B00161S2RK,A new blade makes for near edges and faster work! These arrived quickly and they were cost effective. The bladder is sharp and ready to take on the task.Always check to make sure you are getting the correct size blade! This is series I.,5
B00161S2RK,The cutter was easy to replace,5
B00161S2RK,Works great in my Kiskars paper cutter!,5
B00161S2RK,"I purchased these as backup for my new Fiscars cutter,  work perfectly.",5
B00161S2RK,It's fiskars - I knew I wouldn't be disappointed because love the brand. Great quality as usual with this brand.,5
B00161S2RK,The edge stays sharp far longer than the regular.  Spring for titanium.,5
B00161S2RK,I love these replacement blades. It's actually a lot better than the original blade that came with my cutter. I wish I would have had this blade originally!,5
B00161S2RK,It performs as stated in the add,5
B00161S2RK,"I didn't realize how dull the blade was on my paper cutter that I found at goodwill. I thought I was my cardstock. When I put a new blade in, wow no frayed edges. Cut like knew.",5
B00161S2RK,These fit and work perfectly for my scrapbooking paper cutter.,5
B00161S2RK,"Love these blades. The only downside is how often I have to change them out. Still, I love the cutter they go with and will continue to use them regardless.  = )",5
B00161S2RK,"Having purchased the Fiskars TripleTrack Titanium Trimmer Replacement Blades, I can attest to their precision and durability, addressing the universal need for reliable cutting tools. The blades fit seamlessly into my trimmer, delivering clean cuts consistently. However, the only drawback is the price point. While quality comes at a cost, the price might be a deterrent for some. Nevertheless, if you prioritize precision in your crafting endeavors, these replacement blades meet that need exceptionally well.",5
B00161S2RK,Bought this for the scoring blade. Just what I wanted.,5
B00161S2RK,"I'm a new card maker and have already made almost 200 cards and matching envelops.  That means that I have done a lot of paper cutting.  I truly regret that this Fiskars trimmer was not my first trimmer, it's so accurate.  It cuts straight!  I thought the fault of uneven cutting was my own but not so!!!  I took this out of the box an hour ago and started cutting immediately (I have about 100 more cards to make for my project) and the trimming is stellar!!!  The removal of blade is super simple and the big bonus is that it can be used with a scoring blade which I also purchased.  It so nice to just score my cards for a single fold on the trimmer itself.If you are looking for a trimmer and you are a card maker consider that you really want a trimmer that has a platform of 6"" so that it is very accurate,  having the fold out arm at 4 inches makes measuring the fractions over 4"" very difficult to get right.  The other compromise we should not do as card makers is have a paper trimmer that cannot handle a 12"" x 12"" paper!  All the smaller guillotine cutters go to 10""  and the other trimmer types have 4"" platform.  Given those restrictions I purchased this trimmer and I'm super content.",5
B00161S2RK,"I love this for my Friskars cutter and I saved one blade just for cutting chipboard.  Yes!  I said chipboard.  My cuts are perfect and I can throw away my blade knife.  The titanium blades are very good and cut both ways.  Just for fun, I took one blade to see how it worked on chipboard.  I've been making a lot of boxes, mini bookshelves and 3d houses using the chipboard I cut.  I make two cuts on one side, flip the chipboard, and make one single cut and the chipboard is perfect.",5
B00161S2RK,"I make greeting cards and I use these cutters all the time. They cut very well most of the time, but they do wear out overtime.  They are much more economical from Amazon than from Michael's or other craft stores.I use them in a Fiscar's cutting device they just slide in and you put your paper in and cut the size you want.They work great!",5
B00161S2RK,"I found a thrifted sliding cutter, but needed replacement blades. Received them fast and am pleased with the quality!",5
B00161S2RK,Fast delivery. Nice that it comes in a two pack. It's nice to always have a spare,5
B00161S2RK,Perfect replacement part to refresh old cutter. I like that it included 2 cutters at a better value than buying individually. Works as expected.,5
B00161S2RK,Love using my paper cutter and now I can do so without tearing the paper because the blade got dull.,5
B00161S2RK,"I bought this because I needed a scorer and saw that this came with a replacement blade as well.  However, the scorer fits on cutter perfect but the replacement blade is too tight and will not slide up and down on the track.  Hope they fix this! Will give 5 stars when the problem is fixed!",4
B00161S2RK,Perfect.  Exactly what I needed.,5
B00161S2RK,"I have arthritis in my hands and these domed tabs help so much with gripping these blades. I won't use any others from now on. Plus, it's Fiskars ... what more needs to be said. ;)",5
B00161S2RK,Glad to still find blades that fit my old paper cutter.  I don't use it very often so they last a long time.  The new one was easy to install.  Nice to have a sharp blade again!,5
B00161S2RK,"They cut through cardstock really easily and once they are too dull for that, I keep them for thin card board and chip board. I just mark them with an X so I know they are not for paper and cardstock.",5
B00161S2RK,I haven't used them!,5
B00161S2RK,"I ordered two packs of these blades, since I use them for schoolwork and go through them quite quickly if I'm doing a lot of presentation boards. It's very important my boards look neat, clean, and professional, so having top quality products when creating them is simply important. The blades and the cutter they go on, are simply really good. They're the best ones out there that I have tried. So why only a 4 star review?Like I wrote, I ordered two packs, and one of them contained two completely dull blades. Everything I tried to cut with them, and that is a large variety of things, tore and frayed. Paper, fabric, and plastic. For someone working on a final presentation and having some of their work ending up ruined, needing to start over, that is just ever so frustrating. The other pack had blades that were completely fine and razor sharp, so I figured out pretty quickly to throw the bad blades out.I don't know if I got unlucky when I ordered and got a packet out of a bad batch or what, but otherwise these blades are really good. I use them to cut paper, cardstock, thin wood (like model building basswood), plastic laminate samples from the hardware store, and even mounted fabric; with a set of good blades from this brand, none of those will break, tear, or fray, and will produce clean cuts everytime.",4
B00161S2RK,"I love Fiskars paper cutters and use mine quite often...I have 3.  I try to always keep replacement blades on hand, but they do tend to last quite a long time.  I have had no trouble in replacing them in the cutter.  They basically just slide in with a little push.  I have used Fiskars products for many years both in my home crafting and in my classroom.  I have never been displeased with any of these products.  I now am retired and started working with a girls' group in my church.  One of the first things I did was place all the (pitiful) scissors in the classroom with new Fiskars scissors!",5
B00161S2RK,"These are easy to get in and out of the cutter itself.  They last a fair amount of time for sharpness.  As soon as they start dragging or not cutting easily, change them.",5
B00161S2RK,Finally replaced the original. Simple for what it is.,5
B00161S2RK,"Replacement blades for my paper cutter, what I needed.",5
B00161S2RK,Great Replacement Blade works great and easy to replace blade.,5
B00161S2RK,This was perfect fit to replace my Fiskar paper cutter blade!,5
B00161S2RK,Arrived on time as stated and fits well as a replacement in a cutting tool made by the  same manufacturer. A great replacement and saves money so that you do not have to buy the tool itself.,5
B07TXVGGQM,Excellent for kids 3-8,5
B07TXVGGQM,Our granddaughter uses these when we babysit her.  They are a nice size and cut well.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Easy to use, good fit for little hands appear durable but I guess time will tell!",5
B07TXVGGQM,"The LIVINGO 3-pack of 5-inch scissors is an excellent product for preschoolers, suitable for both left- and right-handed children. The stainless steel blades provide clean cuts, making them ideal for various crafting activities. However, it's important to note that the sharp blades can be dangerous without adult supervision. The product description should specify the appropriate age range more clearly to ensure safety. Overall, these scissors are a fantastic addition to any craft supply kit, offering quality and versatility. Highly recommended for use with adult guidance.",4
B07TXVGGQM,"I loved the fun colors! My patients think they're cute, too!",5
B07TXVGGQM,Very good,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Nice quality, good size.  Like that they have a cover so they can be transported safely.",5
B07TXVGGQM,"Excelente, cortan muy bien.",5
B07TXVGGQM,"Sharp and does the job, my kids love them.Love the idea of the Lids but after a month they are all lost",4
B07TXVGGQM,I keep a pair of the scissors in my workout bag. I use the scissors to open my frozen pedialyte freeze pop after my workout sessions. The scissors work like a charm without puncturing other items in my bag. Love the safety cap.,5
B07TXVGGQM,The blades are short.,4
B07TXVGGQM,My 2 1/2-year-old granddaughter loves these and is learning the proper way to cut paper easily.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Sending product overseas for children who are living in poverty, they will be perfect",5
B07TXVGGQM,I love these for my son.,4
B07TXVGGQM,"They were as expected, but the blue cap wouldn't secure on directly out of the package.",4
B07TXVGGQM,"Maybe good for 6,7, or 8 yr olds.  They arrived very quickly which was handy.",5
B07TXVGGQM,as above,5
B07TXVGGQM,Good,5
B07TXVGGQM,Love these scissors for my 3.5yo. We got other ones that would just test his patience (which isn't a lot). These actually work and I love the cover on them too.,5
B07TXVGGQM,Our child loves these scissors. Much better than the all plastic scissors she has been using.,5
B07TXVGGQM,My three year old granddaughter finds them easy to use and I like that there are three,5
B07TXVGGQM,My daughter really likes using the scissors. They have good grip and we as a family love the fact that they have tip covers which is something you don't see often. Recommend use for ages 8+ years.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"The scissors cut well and are comfortable for my kids hand. However, the covers do not actually stay on the scissors at all.",4
B07TXVGGQM,I orders these and the number one selling kids scissors for my 4 year old to compare and pick which one he liked. He tried them both and picked these!! He loved the soft grip. He then asked if he could practice cutting! Buy these!!,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Why have caps for scissors if they're not meant to stay on and just sit on and fall off....would never stay on unless sitting somewhere and never being touched....so if you're buying these so they're protected for little ones or in a drawer to not get cut, don't the caps are useless!",3
B07TXVGGQM,Good safe scissors I got got my daughter in kindergarten. Good value for the price.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"This silly Nana just found out what the problem was in cutting, after a not so complimentary report from my grandchild's Pre-K teacher.  I really did not know there were left hand scissors out there. This little 5 yr. old is doing much better, with her basic cutting skills.",5
B07TXVGGQM,This pair of scissors is safer and can be used by my little daughter!,5
B07TXVGGQM,Perfect for my kids! Great value and super functional!,5
B07TXVGGQM,"I bought these scissors to teach my toddlers to use scissors and these are sturdy, fit their hands very well, are sharp enough to actually cut paper ( and not just massage it) but not so sharp as to cause accidents. We practice cutting on the lawn outside- all the fun of confetti but none of the mess in my house.",5
B07TXVGGQM,Perfect for back to school,5
B07TXVGGQM,These are great little scissors that actually cut.Some other safety scissors we have tried are very safe because they don't cut easily and left my granddaughter very frustrated.These are much better. She is ambidextrous and uses them easily with each hand.,5
B07TXVGGQM,A,3
B07TXVGGQM,Perfect little scissors comes with a cap,5
B07TXVGGQM,"These are just what any toddler would need to learn. Grab a practice book or make your own! I really love that they all have safety covers. It's made it much easier to set strict rules around safety. ""We do not move the scissors away from our work station until they are covered."". Also how they are stored.",5
B07TXVGGQM,These safety scissors are well made and colorful.,5
B07TXVGGQM,Easier than shopping,5
B07TXVGGQM,"when I purchase these I thought they were just left handed scissors. but they're supposed to be dual, left or right.  Grandkids seem to like them but not what I thought I purchased. I need to read descriptions closer.",4
B07TXVGGQM,I have not used the scissors much yet but they have a good feel in my hand to use.  I like the safety cover for the blades if keeps them closed and protected. Also like the three color pack.,5
B07TXVGGQM,Love that the whole family can use these comfortably,5
B07TXVGGQM,We love them!  My grandson loves the color and they work great for his little hands.  He is 3.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Well made and easy to use for my preschooler. We advanced to these after the plastic training scissors (3 pack with paper designs to cut out). The safety pieces fit nicely on the three we have.My son did cut his hair the first week buuuuut that's pretty par for the course if you ask me. Curiosity is a huge motivator! When my son helps me do things that require cutting - crafts, cooking, trimming loose threads- these scissors work just as well as adult scissors.My son learned to hold scissors by offering me his hand in a handshake and I'd place the scissors in his hand.",5
B07TXVGGQM,Works good. Good size for small children. I love that they are for left and right handed. The soft rubber handles are comfortable for kids.,5
B07TXVGGQM,Appear to be safe.,4
B07TXVGGQM,These are perfect for my little grandchildren's hands.,5
B07TXVGGQM,Trying to get a 3 year old to learn how to use scissors. They seem well made and he was interested. It will take a while for him to learn but he liked them.,5
B07TXVGGQM,I bought these for my granddaughter because she loses scissors all the time. They are perfect for her use.,5
B07TXVGGQM,My child loves them they are so easy to use.,5
B07TXVGGQM,we work with samartians purse and fill backpacks for kids they work well,5
B07TXVGGQM,I bought these for my first grader and they are exactly what I was looking for. Nice colors and the protective cover and rounded ends make them safe for little ones. My son uses them with ease and they fit his hand perfectly. Happy with the purchase.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like these scissor very much. I think kids 4 and above  manage fine with them but it really is easy to use for a right or left hand..  For me these scissor are a great value  for the price. I can use in the office,bedroom, kitchen anywhere I need to cut some thing every day use.",5
B07TXVGGQM,Perfect for toddler hands!,5
B07TXVGGQM,"We bought these for our almost 4 year old grandson. He likes the padded grip, the colors, and they seem to cut well as he was cutting some cardboard. We like the blunt tip for safety and it doesn't seem to hinder cutting. So far a win and we'll see how they hold up, but appear very sturdy.",5
B07TXVGGQM,"Finally, a scissors that doesn't just fold the paper over!  My granddaughter loves them!",5
B07TXVGGQM,Item came quickly and my grandchildren loved them. I was grateful for the scissor covers when my grandson decided to run while holding a pair.,5
B07TXVGGQM,I bought these for my grandkids. They are not only colorful but I love that they have blade covers which adds to the safety features when they are not in use.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"I purchased these to use when I travel.  Airlines will not allow sharp objects, and if I am taking a long flight I like to be able to take my crochet with me to pass the time.  These scissors are perfect.  Because of how well made they are plus easy to use, I will always have a pair of these scissors with my projects at all times.",5
B07TXVGGQM,Art craft work for granddaughter and she loves her new scissors. The colors are pretty and vibrant.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"These scissors are perfect for a toddler. They are accessible for left or right handed kids. The down fall is that the safety cap does click on. It just sits on top, so it easily falls off.",3
B07TXVGGQM,These are just great! Comes with a couple stickers to put on them. The grip is very smooth and makes it very easy for my 5yo daughter to hold. Nice that this comes in a pack of 3. Love that they all come with a guard as I also have a handsy 1 year old. Tips are very blunt and you wont break skin with them. Well made and thought out. Look forward to making a lot of crafts with my kid :).,5
B07TXVGGQM,These are great scissors to start your littles (2+) with cutting and building motor skills. Grab a little scissor/cutting practice book and let them enjoy the building of a new skill.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Works really well, I would buy it again.",5
B07TXVGGQM,"This item was a big success, safe for little hands, and easy to use with the molded handle",5
B07TXVGGQM,Great stocking stuffers,5
B07TXVGGQM,"As safety scissors, they get the job done. Came in 3 pack of different colors for my kids to choose from, that was a plus. My only complaint is the caps for the scissors are not consistent: one fit perfectly, one was too tight, one was too loose....",4
B07TXVGGQM,Great!  Safe and easy to use!,5
B07TXVGGQM,3 yr old loved them.,4
B07TXVGGQM,Covers were great and 3 pk option was well priced,5
B07TXVGGQM,"The scissors themselves are sharp and cut well, but the plastic caps that cover the blades fall right off and would be immediately lost in a child's backpack or art supplies box.",3
B07TXVGGQM,Excellent product,5
B07TXVGGQM,The dizzies were very easy for my 4 yr granddaughter to useAnd the safety cap protects but is still easily removed,5
B07TXVGGQM,Great for my small groups in kindergarten.,5
B07TXVGGQM,"Perfect for little hands. Bought for my 4 and a half year old daughter. Awesome that it comes in a colorful pack of 3. She kept the pink pair (of course). My 6 year old son chose the red pair. And she generously gave me the blue one (keeping for whenever they misplace theirs). Oh! And not only are the convenient covers great, but BONUS: They come with sheets of little stickers that they can decorate their personal scissors with!!",5
B07TXVGGQM,My 4 year was easy to use,4
B07TXVGGQM,"My grandaughter is 4 years old and loves cutting paper. These are the right size, easy to  use and not sharp on the ends. Since she got them 1 week ago she must have cut over a 1000 pieces of paper, ribbons and even play dough into very small pieces. Highly recommend!",5
B07TXVGGQM,Came as described. Good for you children learning to use scissors,5
B07TXVGGQM,I had to swap the lids around to make them fit. Decent scissors though.,4
B07TXVGGQM,My twin granddaughters had learned on plastic scissors which were fine but they had out grown them. These were the perfect replacement. Sharper but still safe. The third pair were great for 8 yr old brother!,5
B07TXVGGQM,"I got these for my granddaughter, 4 years old. They are very good will cut through 4 layers of flannel, stay sharp awhile. I would buy again, better than some of my expensive sewing sizzors.",5
B07TXVGGQM,"Kids friendly, good.",5
B07TXVGGQM,I like the cover that goes over the end .,5
B00I00RASM,"Perfect! This is just as described. It is VERY sharp and it is a long blade than the regular blade that you use on your cutting machines. It is meant for cutting thicker things like cardboard, etc. It works very well. If I need another one, I will get it from this seller.",5
B00I00RASM,Great blades for your vinyl needs,5
B00I00RASM,Perfect!,5
B00I00RASM,Works and fits my machine. Crafting is a breeze with this blade. Definitely recommend!,5
B00I00RASM,,5
B00I00RASM,as advertised,4
B00I00RASM,Great price and a little bit cheaper than their website PLUS faster delivery time.,5
B00I00RASM,Works like it should.,5
B00I00RASM,"The packaging of this blade is confusing, it says it's for the Cricut Explore. After researching, I came to the conclusion that if it fits an Explore, it will fit a Maker 3, so I took the chance and bought it.  I'm glad I did, it cut's beautifully.  Although it's obvious that you must remove the the rubber tip when installing the blade to the housing, I thought I would mention it just in case someone doesn't notice it.",5
B00I00RASM,Great,5
B00I00RASM,I love this deep-blade! Will definitely be purchasing more when this one gets dull. I used it for cutting out stencils and they came out amazing!! Fit my cricuit air 2 perfectly.,5
B00I00RASM,"I'm certain this will work for many projects and as it is not returnable I will keep it for other purposes, but I needed a different blade as this one will not work on chipboard and thus will not work for the project I am currently attempting.",4
B00I00RASM,Works great. Cuts through heavy card stock with no problem.,5
B00I00RASM,These are perfect replacements for my cricut maker3!,5
B00I00RASM,The Cricut brand always works well. This did exactly what it was supposed to do.,5
B00I00RASM,Great replacement for printer.,4
B00I00RASM,"This is easy to install, well built, being a beginner in the cricuit this has been great.",4
B00I00RASM,Woke grate in my cricut maker. Cut glitter paper beautifully.,5
B00I00RASM,Great product and price,5
B00I00RASM,This blade works as expected with the standard expected from Cricut. Using it to cut thin wood sheets.,5
B00I00RASM,"This blade did exactly what I needed it to. The original blade my Cricut came with was unable to cut through Mylar plastic, this blade sliced through the plastic like nothing. Excellent blade that is really sharp and cuts deep.",5
B00I00RASM,This is a good blade replacement for the cricut machine. It is the normal blade and lasts for a lot of cuts.Great quality product.,5
B00I00RASM,Worked great for my Cricut,5
B00I00RASM,"Although this blade is advertised as being for the explore air series. I looked on cricut's website and it says it's for all explore and maker machines. This blade fits perfectly and works in my cricut explore air 2 and my maker. It cuts deeper than the fine point blade. Another reviewer mentioned it is a deep point blade not a deep cut blade. And that is true but, If you look at the blade section on cricut's website (where it shows you all the blades they make for each machine and what each one is for) the blade is actually called a deep point blade and there is no blade on there called a deep cut blade. People just call them both names. There is a knife blade for thicker materials for use in the cricut maker machines only and it works great ( I added screenshots from the cricut website with some of the blades, the deep point blade description, and recommended materials it cuts) Hope this helps.",5
B00I00RASM,"I must have gotten a defective one, because it didn't cut worth a darn. But Amazon was great about replacing it, and the one that I received next works the way it is supposed to. As an example, I've included a photo of the same project, done with the same settings, on the same mat. The one on top was the first (defective) blade and the one below was the replacement blade. The first one did not even go all the way through the chipboard and it shredded the board along it's way.I have included this information in case it happens to someone else. Amazon does not accept the defective blades back so it couldn't have been a used blade.I'm still not super thrilled with the replacement blade, as it doesn't seem to do any better than the regular blade. They told me at Cricut the only difference is that it's a little longer and can reach a little deeper, however, the sharp part of the blade itself seems to be the same size. The difference in length seems so insignificant and I have not yet come across a project where it was absolutely necessary. It's not sharper or stronger or anything like that, according to the associate at Cricut I spoke with.I hope this helps someone make an educated decision.",4
B00I00RASM,"Don't waste your money on other blades.  This is the one you need.  After 2 years of using regular blades, I could not get my Cricut to make clean cuts.  This premium blade did the trick!",5
B00I00RASM,"This works perfect in my Cricut Maker machine. (Not the maker 3, just maker, thought it should work for that too.) I was using it to cut grafix brand shrink plastic ink jet printable paper. Cuts like butter! Perfect!I originally bought an non cricut brand one but they sent me the wrong housing (they sent me deep-pont blades, with a fine point housing-this makes a big difference) I didn't notice that cricut brand was only a doller more, should have just got this one to start with.",5
B00I00RASM,"This is easy to use, but if you already have quick swap housing that your machine came with you don't need this entire unit.  You can get away with just purchasing the blade. But having both does make it really easy to insert into the cricut machine.My only warning is for buyers with small children- the blade sticks out, but does not come with an end cap like some of the others. Be careful with where you leave this around small children and little hands- even yourselves.",4
B00I00RASM,Worked  so far on thin cardboard. Haven't tried anything else so far.,5
B00I00RASM,Using this in Cricut Maker. Cuts smoothly. Very sharp.,5
B00I00RASM,Great fit,5
B00I00RASM,"I noticed a lot of people were wondering if the housing was actually needed in order to use the deep cut blades or not, and it was something I was wondering also. So initially, I only bought the deep cut blades without the housing and used them with the regular housing that came with my cricut explore air 2. They fit fine in the regular housing and the machine is able to use It, HOWEVER, while I was trying to cut 2mm craft foam with it, no matter how much I adjusted the settings, it wouldn't cut all the way through.So I finally decided to buy the deep cut housing since this was needed for client work, and once I switched it, It had no problem at all cutting all the way through. So to answer anyone who may have that same question, it can technically work with the regular housing, but there is a possibility that it won't cut all the way through or cut as well. For me personally, It was definitely needed.",5
B00I00RASM,As described. Works like it should.,4
B00I00RASM,"Cuts great, wish I would of bought this from the start",5
B00I00RASM,"Works on deeper cuts. I was able to cleanly cut rubber legs from an industrial sheet.Used on Cricut Maker. Amazon had by far the best price compared to other stores. Be careful to order the original part, not imitations.",5
B00I00RASM,Love this for cutting wood!,5
B00I00RASM,Great,5
B00I00RASM,I needed to cut some stencils of my own design . I have an older  Cricut  Explore I picked up second hand. I used this deep cut blade and housing  with a normal grip mat. The material I got for this is 7.5 mil mylar plastic. To perform cuts I set the material setting to Plastic / Transparancy and the blade pressure to More.  I cut a number of stencils each only needing one pass. They came out great. Im so happy.,5
B00I00RASM,I can't really rate this properly star-wise. I thought the description said it was compatible with Cricut Maker but it is not. I did get a refund but just wanted others to know the compatibility issue.,5
B00I00RASM,"I made the He or She for my son's baby reaveal. He lo Ed it He said he love how it looked like the letters were embroider to the backdrop drapes.  I used them for thick cardboard, it work perfect for me.  I love the price I recommend 100% . Will buy more cricut blades from this shop.",5
B00I00RASM,Very high quality,5
B00I00RASM,"I am a recent cricut user, so do not know much about cricut accessories, much less have experience with using a cricut machine.  However, I read about the deep cut blade as a must-have since I use plenty  of heavy cardstock,  glitter and specialty paper. And I am happy to share that this product is true to its word. It cuts great and is precise.The paper peels off easily from the Cricut mat and no longer does my standard blade leave bits of paper uncut and  I can breathe easy knowing that my projects will come out exactly as they should be. I am highly  satisfied  and I look forward to purchasing this product again in the future.",5
B00I00RASM,I use this to cut foam sheets on my Cricut Explorer Air 2.  It works great.,5
B00I00RASM,Very good buy at better price then the local craft store.,5
B00I00RASM,"Up until I actually started my project, I wasn't sure this was for the Maker or not- The packaging is all about the Explore and some of the reviews on this page were for a completely different blade, so even when ordering, I was not sure what was going to show up.So, first, it is indeed one official Cricut Deep Point Bland and Housing. The package will only say for the Explore;But, it does work with the Maker.",5
B00I00RASM,Me gusta,5
B00I00RASM,"Excelente producto, calidad y proceso de entrega, totalmente satisfecho con la compra.",5
B00I00RASM,"This is a great deal, worth ordering! I will order again.",5
B00I00RASM,Got this to use with my Cricut maker when I needed to cut through stencil/thick acetate sheets. It worked perfectly!,5
B00I00RASM,"I was hoping to use this to cut felt. But it kind of just balled it up and made a mess. It didn't work at all. I'm wondering if t might be time needing the stronger mat. I just have the green ones. I have tons of felt, that's one of the biggest things I want to do is make my kids felt Books. I hope I figure it out soon!So I'm sure mine is more user error. Haha. I'm still fairly new at Cricut.",4
B00I00RASM,"I didn't think I'd need a deep cut blade, but I was wrong. This does an excellent job making deeper cuts with fewer passes. Saves time and money.",5
B00I00RASM,Lo utilizo con la Cricut explorer 2.,5
B00I00RASM,Me funciono perfectamente,5
B00I00RASM,This came quickly and was exactly what I needed.,5
B00I00RASM,"I was using the Cricut knife blade to cut craft foam, but it would leave jagged edges at times and took longer since it required more than one pass.This deep cut blade has worked great so far, producing very clean edges and only needing one pass. Wish I would have bought this sooner!",5
B00I00RASM,Honestly this is one of the best blades I have gotten I've only used a fine point but the steep cut blade literally cuts through anything and makes the waiting process on small designs so much quicker,5
B00I00RASM,works as advertised,5
B00I00RASM,No issues,5
B00I00RASM,I find these blade to be extremely weak. You can get a few projects done before they completely dull out on you; always having to replace them.,5
B00I00RASM,Works good,5
B00I00RASM,"I got this for my mother for her Cricut machine, to be able to cut leather out.  It does depend on the thickness of the leather, we have found out.  But, if you use the right size that is suggested by Cricut, it works quite nicely.  We did find out, however, that you need to use the heavy tack mat for the leather, in order for this to work correctly.  But, all in all, it does just what it is said to do.",5
B00I00RASM,Be careful what you cut with this because this works a little too well. I forgot to switch it out and it cut straight through my HTV. Needless to say it does cut deep,5
B00I00RASM,Exactly as advertised,5
B00I00RASM,Haven't tried yet but should work good,5
B00I00RASM,very expensive for the times that I cut well I use it to cut templates but I cut 10 and it lost the sharp,4
B00I00RASM,"I believe the product will stand up to the Cricut reputation. When I opened package, I saw that the blade was for a Cricut Explorer. Any one know if I can use the deep knife blade on a Cricut Maker? I hate sending back items.",5
B00I00RASM,works great,5
B00I00RASM,I love to use it because it cuts so well,5
B00I00RASM,"Packaged just as if I'd pick up from michaels or joanns. I'm a new cricut owner so I did have to pull up a video to load the blade, but no fault of the sellers!",5
B00I00RASM,This is Cricut brand and worked as expected!,5
B00I00RASM,For the newbies on how to install it: I used it on Air 1 and it fit. I had to take off tip protector to find blade. I thought the soft plastic tip was the blade but it was just the protector for the blade.,5
B00I00RASM,Cumplio con las pespectivas,5
B00I00RASM,it cuts like butter - I love watching it work!! so much faster and accurate instead of doing it by hand!!! just have to go out and get more stuff to cut!!,5
B00I00RASM,Getting ready to use it for magnets.,5
B00I00RASM,Works great for cutting cardstock! Had to look up the settings that I needed to use on the Crichton site but once I did that it was super easy to use.,5
B00I00RASM,Not a lot of settings for deep blade but it works great on thicker materials.,5
B00I00RASM,Love this product!  I have started using the empty cereal boxes the using the die cuts to add demention to my scrapbook pages.  I tape the flat boxes to an old cricut mat and this works perfectly using the deepest setting.  I have also cut out thin wood with this and it works just as well!  The possibilities are endless with this blade!  A must have for any Cricut owner,5
B00I00RASM,I love everything about it from the pricing to the packing as well as delivering.  I enjoy using my deep cut blade. Thanks happy customer,5
B00I00RASM,"Not sure why this item says Explore only, it works perfectly in the Cricut Maker.  Cuts through upholstery vinyl really well.",5
B00I00RASM,"I did some thick 10 mil stencils on my Cricut Maker.  This blade did it pretty easily, even though I needed to do three passes.  Highly recommended for thicker ""hard"" materials.",5
B00I00RASM,I was looking for a Cricut blade so I could cut 32mm rubber. This blade does the job.,5
B00I00RASM,"I cut a lot of poster board, so this deep cut blade is great for that.",5
B00I00RASM,"I had thought I would need this blade to cut through fabric with heat bond attached. The regular blade worked better and did not tear my image. I am glad I purchased this though for my ""stock"" in the event I do have thicker cut projects. That way it will be on hand when I need it.",4
B00I00RASM,I will be using this deep Cricut blade to cut out bass wood miniature,5
B00I00RASM,Cricut is very proud of their merchandise. It makes it difficult as I'm on a fixed income. Wish there was a knock-off to use.,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,"There is non scented wax, that hardens to a white color. Easy to use and worth the money. I lit my first homemade candle and the only thing I have against it is when candle is lit and burning, with one Wick, it burns down the middle and there is ALOT  of wax wasted when the Wick burns down to the end. Along the jar I have a great deal of wax that didn't melt down. It's fun, beautiful,  and easy but the wax doesn't evaporate as much as I would like. As you can see in the picture.  Otherwise great product",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"This was my first time trying out candle making. I wanted to do something creative for Christmas presents this year. I love that this kit includes the stickers and wicks. It made the process very easy. Make sure you add the fragrance when the wax is at 185 degrees Fahrenheit, that is the best temperature for the fragrance to bind to the wax. Burns nicely. I used size 8oz containers and was able to make 24 candles. Great product. I will use again in the future.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,This seems to be good quality wax and a good amount of it at a good price. It comes with everything you need to get started aside from whatever fragrance/receptacle you choose to use. Pretty good burn quality and easy to use!,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Fantastic deal! Great set and quality. Very pleased and going to purchase more.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"Definitely have purchased the same kit several times now! The dye is great the wax is good however it does have a little frosting but it is soy! Nothing that your heat gun can't get rid of. I love that they send all the extras that you need from the wix plus the metal wick holders. The wax melts easily and is smooth, definitely would recommend for any beginner or intermediate, nice scent throw,Great purchase. Arrived quickly every time I have ordered",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,This product has been a vital part of my small business and it's growth.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"This was my first ever experience with candle making. My candles came out great for a first time I'd say. For all who complain about uneven burn and surfaces, make sure you don't add too much coloring agents and oils. If you do, you need a thicker wick, OR mix in paraffin wax, it will help. (I purchased both this soy wax from this seller and paraffin by Blended Wax, it worked great).",4
B09ZG8P7ZB,"exactly as described. Thank you, I'll order this again when the times comes to restock.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Just what I needed to make candles,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Started making candles with this product. I have re-purchased this item several times. I love it being a soy based candle product.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"Product itself is not terrible but the packaging was another story. There was a huge hole in the bag so when I went to grab the bag of wax, it spilled everywhere. Also, there were no instructions included on how to make the candles and the candle metal centering pieces were also missing.",3
B09ZG8P7ZB,Satisfied at quality,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,Muy bien,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,Muy buena para derretir,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I love this. It is exactly what I needed, it works so much better than my last wax melter.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"This is a good soy to use if you are trying to get used to soy and experimenting with it.  I bought it to try to perfect my whipping. I was brand new to candle making and knew some of my creations would involve ""whip"" so I figured this big box would be able to teach me that! It did! And also produced a few handfuls of candles for me. It's a great one for daily personal use and a decent one for mid-level candle makers. I would recommend for that. I wouldn't recommend staying with ONLY this wax if you are trying to grow your business or get to a luxe level but if you're doing even candle bakery it's good. Which when you evolve in candle making, you see that there are way more budget friendly n higher quality options out there.  But this is good for daily personal use and candle bakery type creations. It is workable but Jar adhesion is not great if you're working w glass vessels",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I brought just to try out as a back -up wax. i melted, colored, scented the wax. let it cool to the correct pouring temperature. I used two different candle molds. one candle came out the mold with no problem, the other candle broke while unmolding. Big disappointment. The cold and hot throw was good, but it does tunnel. I think that I would use this wax for wax melts.",3
B09ZG8P7ZB,Never received any instructions,3
B09ZG8P7ZB,"have made lots of candles with this wax.  you need a lot of scent thought, the wax itself has an odd, strong smell. melts great, very easy to work with",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,I am new to candle making but this wax was so easy for a newbie to use.  I have made several and will order more wax so that I can make candles for Christmas presents. I had the wax with two days or ordering,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Very nice and smooth candle making wax. Will purchase again.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"It was on time, nicely packed, works great.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Great product but it didn't go as far as I thought.  I had to order more.,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,"This was my first time making candles and it was super easy. The only reason I took a star off is because the kit was supposed to include essential oils, which it did not. I would have just gone for plain wax (not the kit) if I had known this. The wax quality is good, and easy to heat and pour. Burns well. It takes the color cubes a long time to melt. You need more wicks than you think you do unless you are using a very small vessel. I might consider to purchase again.",4
B09ZG8P7ZB,Great wax for candles. Burns really well and disperses the scent fabulously!,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Kit was nice except it was missing the wick centering holders. I had to create my own out of the box. Part of the point of getting the kit was that it was supposed to have everything needed.,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,Works great,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I like this brand of candle wax. It was easy to melt, easy to mix with essential oils, and easy to pour into candle molds. It dries white and not an off-yellow color. I would highly recommend!",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Did well with my candles,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Wicks are very fragile when burned. So get a different wick. Good over all value and worth the money.,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,This is a great product. I use it with my beeswax to make it white and creamy instead of the beeswax yellow. It works great. You get a lot for the money.here are some samples of what I made with it.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"So I've been down the road of ""what do I do with my used Yankee candle jars.This was my answer.  Reuse and plop a ton of wax in and hope for the best.  Success was my answer.Now as awesome as this kit was I will forwarn those who do what I did that without color it almost looks like paste when heated and congealed cold.  I'm not one who ate paste as a kid so it doesn't bring back fond memories, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.  Will recommend to get some essential oils to get that flowing smell, as well as some wax dye to give it color.Will definitely buy it again.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I know almost nothing about candle making. But my kids and I decided to make candles to give away as Christmas gifts so purchased this kit.We bought a junky non-stick saucepan at a thrift store to melt the wax with and it melted really quickly on a low heat setting. We dumped in some fragrance oil (purchased separately). Used the stickers to attach a wick to the bottom of a bunch of small jars, poured the wax in and then used a combination of the wick holders and some bamboo skewers to hold the wicks in place while the wax hardened.I took off 1 star for two reasons. 1. The wax has a pretty strong smell (maybe that's common for soy wax? I wouldn't know). We used an entire bottle of fragrance and you could still kind of smell it. And 2. For the amount of wax and number of wicks you get, I wish it came with more of than two of the wick holders. Like I said, we were able to rig our own using skewers and tape...but I wish they'd just give you more (even if they were not metal...just some kind of throw away cardboard thing).",4
B09ZG8P7ZB,"Easy to use, came with a bunch of wicks, and 2 wick holders.  Will buy again, or buy a larger qty of wax next time.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"Bought this to fill some homemade clay candle holders for an event. Didn't want scented candles so haven't really experimented with that aspect of the wax, but the scentless candles smelled perfectly like nothing. It's super easy to use (I just used an old battered bowl, and microwaved until it melted) and so long as you are mature enough to know how to work with hot wax, it's very easy. I was able to clip two of the wick holders together to create the correct spacing for a 3-wick candle. I think the only thing that could have made this better would have been a wick holder specifically for spacing 3-wick candles, everything else was great. I even ended up with tons of extra wicks so can easily melt down some old candles that didn't burn properly and use the wicks to get as much life out of that wax as possible.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Love this wax! Great to work with ! Easy melting,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,I really like the wax it came in flakes so it was easier to use and you didn't have to chop it up make great candles went to order it again and they raise the price $11 when I bought it it was 17 now it is 28 what's up with that I've heard of inflation but that's ridiculous will not buy again,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"The of premium natural soy wax flakes is perfect for candle making enthusiasts like myself. The inclusion of 100 cotton candle wicks, 100 wick stickers, and 2 centering devices makes the entire process seamless and enjoyable. The quality of the wax is exceptional, producing clean-burning candles with a lovely scent throw. Whether you're a beginner or experienced candle maker, this kit has everything you need to create beautiful, eco-friendly candles. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to indulge in the art of candle making.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,I have bought once before from this company and had no issues and decided I would buy the premium one this time and most of the bag is just big clumps of wax.  I will be back to update if they help me out .  I tried to reach their customer support site but it took me to a restaurant so obviously that link is incorrect !!!,2
B09ZG8P7ZB,Excellent quality & makes beautiful candles,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"This is great wax for homemade candles. It doesn't really have a scent, so whatever essential oil you add to it will be what it smells like. This melts well, and mixes with the oils easily. The candles don't burn through the wax really fast either, and because it is soy wax, it is a cleaner burn.All around this is a good product and a decent price for a quality ingredient.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Everything you need for candles pouring!Really good set,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,As describe,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"These wicks can melt about an inch radius from the wick winlet. Not as large a radius as I wanted but it works. Be careful if you are adding any essential oils to the soy wax. If you add too much, it may compromise the solidity/Make an odd texture.",4
B09ZG8P7ZB,"Easy to use, wicks are easy to cut to the size you need, easy to add colors or scents to.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I'm new to candle making and this kit was just what I needed.  No instructions were included, but I easily found guidance on line.  I used 8 oz canning jars (jelly jars) for my first batches.  The wicks burn perfect and the wax burns clean.  I'm very happy with this purchase.",4
B09ZG8P7ZB,Great product!,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Lasts a good while,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have bought this 10lb bag probably 6 times now. I love that it comes with the metal wick holders- a lot of other soy wax bags do not. I am so glad to have toxin-free candles, but be warned that soy wax does require more essential oils than other waxes. If you are wanting to make big batches of candles, or just some toxin-free gifts for family- I would definitely recommend this brand!",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Best wax burns best,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,I made probably 20 small-med candles from this bag. The sticky wick bottoms are really helpful.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I underestimated how large a 10lb bag would be, it comes with a LOT of wax to use! If you're just a casual candle maker, this will last you for a long time! Comes with every size wick you'd need, and is super easy to use.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I made small and large, the amount was perfect easy to use.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,I just Love this product. It helps me with my costume made candle.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I've been in the market for a new wax, and opted to give Hearth & Harbor Soy Candle Wax a try.  Overall it's a decent product.  You're definitely going to have to break out the heat gun to smooth the tops of your candles, even if you follow the heating and scent mixing instructions to the letter.",4
B09ZG8P7ZB,the only negative think i have to say about this is that the sticky dots that u use to keep ur wick in place doesnt stick once u pour the wax in the container. i even use the thing that goes over the top of what ever containter u use to put the candles in to help keep them centered but once the bottom sticky pad unsticks it becomes uncentered and the wick becomes curly and soft ( like a soggy or under cooked french fry) and u cant stick it back down again one u add the hot wax.,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,Makes great candles,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,I've used this a few times to make candles. I refill the expensive jar candles I burned down and so far they have worked out wonderfully. I like how smooth the wax is. Will most likely buy this product again.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Was able to use about half the wax. (See below) and it took forever to cool because this wax is so soft. I ended up using coconut wax (harder and solidifies faster) with it and it was a perfect blend. Tried a candle out yesterday and it burns beautifully.The only negative was when we opened the package, a huge amount of wax fell to the ground and all over my table and I have German shepherds and this is their shedding season and no one wants hair in their candle. It was a huge mess to clean up because the wax is so soft. I tried to contact the company to let them know they may want to seal their packaging better as it was in a bag that clearly popped open or exploded but besides asking me for my order #, they went completely quiet and did not reply to subsequent emails and amazon said I had to go through the company for issues. I ended up buying a different wax because we needed a specific amount and lost so much, but in the end the blend of this wax and the harder one worked out.",2
B09ZG8P7ZB,Was missing a handful of the wicks :/,2
B09ZG8P7ZB,Melts well.  I keep in an oversized ziplock bag as I use 1 pound (weighed) out at a time.  2 rounds went perfectly to make 18-20 fire starters (depending on how thirsty the 2oz cup of pet bed shavings with saw dust is).  I add a drop of scented oil to each just so the container of fire starters smells good when opened.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"It melts quick and looks good in all sorts of molds. The wicks and stickers are nice. I'm a beginner when it comes to making candles, but this set is great.",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,I really like this company.  I've tried others but this one satisfies me most. It holds scent great it doesn't get watery when heated like others do. I'll be sticking to this brand.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,The picture doesnt even compare to how great this item is! I got so much wax! Arrived so fast!,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"I've never made candles before, but decided I wanted to start to give as gifts, and also use to make branded takeaways for events.For someone who was brand new, it couldn't have been better.  The wax was so easy to use, poured well, and when I added in some coloring, they came out beautifully.  So easy to use.  I've already purchased more because I loved the process so much!",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,Did not like large lumps of wax,4
B09ZG8P7ZB,wedding candle,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Good quality wax for a really good price ! Came with everything on the description!,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"The package arrived on time and with everything as described. It is a great kit for beginners in the candle-making industry, recommended",5
B09ZG8P7ZB,The wax and the wicks are just perfect. The wax melted super easily and held scents we added to it amazingly. The wicks attached to out containers with ease and burn great and not too fast. I have never done something like this but it was super easy and fun to do especially with family or friends.,5
B09ZG8P7ZB,"What else is there to say about this soy-based wax, other than it works? Reasonable price, easy to measure and melt, pours well, solidifies without excessive irregular shrinkage, burns clean. I will definitely order more when this runs out.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"This is easy to use. The adhesion is good, durable material, and perfectly suited to the seat in my VW Jetta. Not much else to say....Looks like new? No, of course no...it's a patch job and does the job - keeps the bursting seat of an aging car from further bursting. I'm very happy with this patch, and it is reasonably priced.",5
B07QX9SKN8,Works pretty good just wish it was stickier,4
B07QX9SKN8,"I am using this to wrap arm and knee pads in my truck.  They are a black plastic that has a rough texture.  Once removed and covered with this product, they look and feel much better.  The leather goes on well, conforms to the needed shape well with some heat.  The adhesive is working so far.  The texture of the leather is pleasant.  I tried a leather like vinyl wrap at first, but felt too cheap and plastic-y.  This leather ""repair"" roll is much nicer.",5
B07QX9SKN8,Perfect color match. Went on easily and after a few weeks it's holding strong.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"Quick fix for cat scratching post, aka our couch. And I just sprayed some Feliway on these repaired areas to keep from happening again. Looks like the cats are just going to have to start using the multiple scratching beds I have bought for them! Highly recommended this product. Color is perfect and the adhesive seems strong.",5
B07QX9SKN8,Cleaned the couch multiple times but this just won't stay on. It seems very tacky (sticky) but comes off within a couple days. I know patching a hole on the sitting surface is much more difficult to keep in place but i thought at least a couple months before having to replace the patch. I even tried cleaning the leather with rubbing alcohol. I eventually added spray adhesive and it's lasting significantly longer now. The material looks really good (natural) and is very durable and easy to cut with scissors. It just needs better adhesive.,4
B07QX9SKN8,This is the 2nd time purchasing.  First time was to repair leather chair that our German Shephard sat in all the time so lots of wear and tear.  Applied to chair about 2 years ago and still holding up and looks good.  Willing to let company sit in the chair now!Just recently purchased as we are going to use to repair a small tear in snowmobile seat.  Hoping works as well as first time.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"I have camel colored counter stools that have a seam right at the base of the seat which started to give way after four years of heavy, daily use. This tape is buying me a little more time before I have to replace the stools. The stickiness quality is great, easy to clean and blends right in with the camel color. No complaints!",5
B07QX9SKN8,"Nice thick leather-like material and good size. But it was too dark, which can be expected when shopping online. The return was easy and efficient.",4
B07QX9SKN8,Not a good writing pen but it does look good.,4
B07QX9SKN8,A leather patch looks so much better than a rip or hole in your car seat. This product seems to adhere to surface very well. (P.s. make sure to clean with isopropyl alcohol first to help promote better adhesive to surface.),5
B07QX9SKN8,I just needed a 3 inch piece to repair a tear in a dark blue leather recliner I was selling. Worked for that purpose but I did not need or use the rest of it and probably never will,4
B07QX9SKN8,This works great! Unfortunately my puppy chewed on the corners of my expensive leather chair. This leather repair tape is so easy to use and in normal lighting blends nicely with the color of the chair. It sticks on easily and stays in place. Would highly recommend.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"It work nicely on my dining room chairs, well done",5
B07QX9SKN8,Looks good and sticks good,5
B07QX9SKN8,Works well,5
B07QX9SKN8,Easy to use - has held up well. Color matches perfectly,5
B07QX9SKN8,"Excellent product!! I have a ""like new"" black gaming chair and my girlfriend and I were ""wrestling"" around on it for a sec and I guess my hat damaged it pretty bad. I cleaned and applied and I swear it looks great!  Bonds to the chair perfectly. No peel up or wrinkles!Colour matches perfectly also! Highly recommend",5
B07QX9SKN8,Easy to apply; blended in with the pre-existing leather upholstery in my car so well that you wouldn't have known there was a patch there if you weren't told. Has endured wear and tear very well. This was a good purchase.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"My very soft leather is a color not easily matched (dusty light blue).  A quote to have it fixed was $1,500 which is insane!  My dogs lay on the back of the couches and the stitching was starting to give and then ripped. I didn't want to try the kits with the glue you need to mix to get the right color so I tried this and it worked great! Instead of patching OVER the rip, I used it UNDER the rip. It's been few days and holding strong with the dogs still jumping and laying on the back. I think it looks pretty awesome! I always have a blanket thrown over the back anyway but still... pretty awesome especially in the location of the rip too where that  leather is being pulled constantly by 4 dogs and they're pitbulls, not little chihuahuas!",5
B07QX9SKN8,"Since working from home, I have utilized my office chair more than typical. My office chair is faux leather and this tape is a great repair for that. Holds very well. Highly recommend this product.",5
B07QX9SKN8,This works fantastic for leather tears. Have used it to fix a tiny hole in back seat. Also fixed a rip in my chair. Worked fantastic.. Very easy to use. It matched the leather was a perfect fit. Stickiness is great. You get a big piece for the cost.,5
B07QX9SKN8,We have used this product before but have found that dye colors are different when using the tapeor the patch.  We have ordered both in the same color...a close match but not exact so be sure of yourcolor choice.  You can see the different dye lots.,4
B07QX9SKN8,"I needed a product to help cover/repair a hole in the second row leather seat in my car. This strip is a nice weight. Not too thick, but seems sturdy and good quality. I only needed a very small piece so I cut a small circle and placed it over the hole. It covers the hole but it is visible like a patch. Hopefully over time it will seat and not be so noticeable. Covering the hole though will keep anything from snagging the leather further and prevent it from getting any bigger hopefully.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"We're trying to sell our travel trailer, and it had some wear along the edge of the pop out where it had rubbed when it went in and out.  If you get a good color match, it is WONDERFUL to work with - easy to cut, and easy to position.  Once you get it down though, be sure it's where you want it because it's not coming off!  Really saved the day because you can't duct tape or color things like that with a marker, and they look ragged for a sale.  We left some for the potential buyer in case they get other cuts in the many vinyl pads and covers throughout the unit.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"Good price, good color match and prompt delivery.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"It hold seems on our faux leather bench well for some time now. We use the bench hundred ,times a day to put the shoes on, to take them of. Works!!",5
B07QX9SKN8,I was amazed at how well the color and texture match my chair. There is a strip of the tape on the seam on the arm of the chair. It is not noticeable at all. It seems pretty sticky so I hope it stays a there a long time.,5
B07QX9SKN8,Works great so far. I repaired a tear on car arm rest. Been two weeks with no peel back. Better than duct tape :),4
B07QX9SKN8,Worked really well in the middle of my sectional when the leather kept coming up,5
B07QX9SKN8,Easy to apply good color and thickness.,4
B07QX9SKN8,I repaired my leather couch with this tape looks great and the color matched my leather chair. Stickers well and leaves no mess!!!,5
B07QX9SKN8,"Perfect color, easy to use. So far so good and color is blending good. Recommended!!",5
B07QX9SKN8,"Even though it's not recommended I'm trying this on a cloth truck seat. You know, where we drag out butts getting in and out and it wears on the edge..... Time will tell if it stays or not. Heck, for this price I figure if it lasts a few weeks, months even I've got enough on the roll for multiple ""repairs"". I've got a spot on a vinyl tractor seat I'm going to use it on too and I'm pretty sure that'll work.",4
B07QX9SKN8,We had previously used some leather repair that was a liquid or paste.  This worked so much better and a much cleaner look.  So far the tap has not come lose.  Very happy with the product,5
B07QX9SKN8,"I used this product to patch some big holes on my leather forklift seat, I previously tried black duct tape, it came off in days, I put this patch on 4 weeks ago, I have to admit I just did a patch job, but it works.  I am in and out of this seat several times a day and it stays on.  Finally a good leather seat patch, very happy with the results.  I used Black Color",5
B07QX9SKN8,Not a professional repair but was pleased with the results.  Adhesive seems strong enough and I had little leather left to which I could adhere.,5
B07QX9SKN8,Used this to repair our couch.  Online color match is a bit challenging. It was easy to use.  Will see how long it lasts.,4
B07QX9SKN8,Great,5
B07QX9SKN8,Good patch up,5
B07QX9SKN8,As close as I could get but not good enough. Returned.,4
B07QX9SKN8,"I got a wide (12x48"") roll to repair our torn car seats, and was pleasantly surprised at the price, quality, and ease of use. I just unrolled it and let it straighten out a bit before cutting some pieces to fit and slapping them on. It has been working great so far, no signs of it giving up or losing adhesion, no peeling or gummy mess at the edges, etc. I'm pretty sure no animals were harmed in the making of this ""leather"", but it seems like a good quality leather-like material.",5
B07QX9SKN8,It was as listed and easy to use.,4
B07QX9SKN8,"I loved this product when I first put it down, however after a few weeks, a dog I take care of that weighs over 100 lbs. And has a bit longer nails (not to my liking), jumps off and on that spot.  He poked a small hole in the patch, and where the edges of the repair comes together, it eventually tore.  If I didn't have dogs that own the couch, it would still be perfect.  The color was not far off from my dark leather couch.  I will buy this product again. And would recommend to others.  (Note: when preparing surface to stick product to, use alcohol to finish cleaning. Test a small spot first and use your own judgment).",5
B07QX9SKN8,"The product works very well, but I received the wrong color and didn't realize it until I had already cut it.",4
B07QX9SKN8,Thanks!!!,5
B07QX9SKN8,Just as advertised,5
B07QX9SKN8,This worked well even though not quite same color.,4
B07QX9SKN8,"I don't know how this happened or what/who did this to my couch, but this repair patch did it's job, stronger and ticker than I thought and color did match almost perfect to my dark brown leather couch, when you do look closely you can tell there are patch tape on it, but other than that it's better than looking at the hole.  Honestly, if not buying a new one to replace the couch,  this should do it's job.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"My 69 charger needs the front seats reupholstered which I plan to do. However, for a short term fix while I wait for the shop to take the seats in, I thought I would try this leather patch. I knew it was a long shot on how it would match and how the edges would look, but it's going to be short term.If you look at the first picture, this is what it looks like after I patched the seat bottom. To see what it is underneath, see the second picture and the seam across the seat bottom in the middle.It took about 15 minutes to put in and I am really pleased with the match. Nice stuff for $33 for the 16x90 role.I will buy this again when I need another patch.Recommended.",5
B07QX9SKN8,It is very thick and a bit hard to work with. Not something that will last very long.,3
B07QX9SKN8,"Our leather footstool was cracked and almost worn through on one side, the other half still looked okay.  So, I tried the 12"" wide leather patch on the worn half (on the left side in the pictures).  I took a wild guess on the color, but bought two colors just in case.  I returned the one Mulberry color because it wasn't right, but kept the ""Red/Brown"" color, because it really matches perfectly!  It is the exact same color as the leather on the footstool.I came back to order another roll, but the Red/Brown is currently unavailable.  I hope it comes back in stock, because since it looks so great on the left side of the footstool I'm going to put a strip on the right side, and, I'd also like to put a strip on the arm of the matching chair.  The arm is dried out and cracked too, and I have a fabric cover on the chair right now to hide it.  Even so, I'd still like to patch the chair arm.I applied the patch on the footstool about 6 months ago.  I have a Mini-Aussie dog, and her 2-year old puppies, and they all play and jump on the footstool all the time.  The leather patch is not budging or curling, or looking marked or scratched in any way.  I am really impressed with this product!  I'm really happy I took the chance.  It has really refreshed the look of the footstool.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"I used this to repair my Katzkin drivers in my F150.  The truck is used on the farm and heavy earthwork projects,  it doesn't see clean clothes, this tape has survived a month, not a bit of peeling.  This is a quality product that holds up in an abusive environment.",5
B07QX9SKN8,Works great. My only wish is that it was thicker. You can still see the outline of the cracked leather with it on. But otherwise it does its job,4
B07QX9SKN8,"I bought the 12"" x 48"" size in Grey to repair the front section of a Kane's Furniture ""Leather"" recliner. It was 3 month's out of warranty and Kane's refused to fix it.  Both recliners had the section behind the calf area of the recliner, start separating from the cloth backing.  Turns out that area was imitation leather, cuz it does not ""touch the skin"".  The upholstery quote to recover both chairs in the bad area was $375. I bought this to try based on reviews. I worked just like other reviews said it would. I did 4 small patches first to test the stickiness, and after those stayed stuck good, I took them off & did the whole bad area from side to side on both recliners. Once you get it on, it sticks very well. Although the color was not a perfect match it was closed enough for our purposes.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"I've got three older bikes with various saddle problems. Gorilla tape was a disaster as the adhesive turned into a gooey mess in hot weather. This  product goes on smoothly, looks good, and doesn't deteriorate. Two of the saddles are vinyl and one is a leather Corbin and it adheres well to all of them.",5
B07QX9SKN8,I had some wear on the footrest of my recliner.  So easy to apply the adhesive strip and matched perfectly.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"This product worked well for me. My leather couch is laid out in 12-inch squares stitched together. Some of the squares split open from being sat upon. I tried at first using leather repair TAPE, but that did not work well; the splits opened up again. So I removed the tape and used this 12-inch wide product Much better!I realize that selecting the right color can be tricky. The color on your computer screen may not perfectly  match the color of the product. My couch is a VERY dark brown-black shade. At first I had selected black-brown tape, but it was too brown. I ended up using the straight black color sheets. That worked better; unless you would shine a bright spotlight on it, the straight black did the trick. I  am completely happy with the results.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"My ten year car's interior is in excellent shape except for a tear that had formed at the seam on side of my drivers seat. I first tried to repair it with one of those leather repair kits. It looked good a while but over time it started to crack and look bad. I decided to slap a piece of leather repair tape on it and be done with it.I first order the standard black color from ONine. I put a piece on but wasn't happy. The tape was a much darker black than the leather on the side of the seat. The piece of tape I cut had a sharp point and that point had started lifting after only a day or two.I then ordered the matte black. This color matched so much better. It actually looks a lot better in person than it does in the photo I provided. I also made sure the piece I cut had rounded edges this time. It's been a couple of months now and the adhesive is still holding up well.Matte black leather repair tape seems hard to find. ONine was the company I could find that makes it. It's a good quality leather repair tape, just don't cut small pieces with sharp corners.I did use the roll of black tape to fix the seat on my daughter's gaming chair. I just cut pieces off the roll and that too has been holding up well.",5
B07QX9SKN8,"My 2016 Cadillac ATS-V came with Recaro racing seats.  I believe the seats listed @ $2K each or something silly like that on the sticker.Seat bolsters eventually start to take a beating over time due to use.  I've put 94,000 miles on my driver's seat since I purchased the car.  I probably have the highest mileage ATS-V in the world.  I bought it to drive it and by God I do damn near every day!!I had gotten into a bad habit of sliding into my seat using the bolster as my guide.  Once day I realized I was wearing it down way faster than I was comfortable with since these seats cannot be replaced.  They would have to be reupholstered.  I imagine that wouldn't be cheap.Along comes this product.  My sacrificial leather piece.  Now granted, this doesn't blend in and look stock.  It looks just like what it is, a piece of leather that I use to cover the bolster of my driver side Recaro so the actual seat underneath still looks good.  It doesn't look like total crap but I wasn't thinking aesthetics.  I was thinking protect my $2000 seat!I've got enough sacrificial lambs on this roll to outlast the car!Super easy to install and the adhesion was fantastic.  A quick 70/30 IPA wipe of the seat, wipe dry, cut the leather patch, install and smooth it in....DONE.  No more bolster wear!!",5
B07QX9SKN8,It was the perfect color. It stays where it is put.It is not noticeable and functions to cover rips well.,5
B07QX9SKN8,Prepping a dark brown pleather couch for sale. Color match was spot on. Needed to use scissors to round the corners before applying. Stuck well. Very happy with the purchase.,5
B07QX9SKN8,They are exactly alike.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"I needed a repair patch for my recliner for a crack that was starting to develop. I figured I better stop it before it got worse,so I found this patch material and luckily they offered a color very close to my recliner, so I ordered it. It came and it really was a close match,so I cut off a piece and removed the backing tape and covered the crack and it looks great. With the color being so close,it's a very clean looking repair. Adhesive seems to be very strong as well. I'm very satisfied with this repair. Cheers!",5
B07QX9SKN8,,4
B07QX9SKN8,This patch works great for repairing leather.  It is thick and sticks well.  I have used it on a car console cover and it worked better than a previous product I tried.,5
B07QX9SKN8,"I got this for my 2007 car, I had a big tear and I used this tape. It defiantly looks better than before but you can tell there is leather tape on my seat. Again, improvement but obvious",4
B07QX9SKN8,"Used this on our Element's car seats. It adheres pretty decently. However, you may want to add additional glue. We'll need to fix one of the patches as it's been peeling due to frequent rubbing/touching and getting dust/hair on the adhesion, which is on the backrest of the seat. The other seat has a patch on the cushion area and it has had no problems since applying it last year.",4
B07QX9SKN8,"Works as described.  Blends right in, stays in place.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,A really good glue. Grabs right away.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Easy and fun to use; goes a long way. I added a few drops of water to thin it out and have used the same bottle for several small projects and one project that was much bigger and I still haven't used up all the product.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Speed of drying not as fast as claimed.,4
B00KD6ZHA4,I think this is a must have for anyone doing their own needlework finishing. I think the gel glue is a little easier to work with over the traditional white glue.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Works as intended and recommended,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"I have use this glue on numerous surfaces, it really adhears.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,This is not a quick dry glue and it did not work for me. I bought it to fold a hem in a cloth to cover a coffee table. It did not stick. Maybe if I could have held it until it dried? I don't know. Not very happy with the purchase.I have used Aleens glue on other craft projects with great success.,3
B00KD6ZHA4,Works as it should and very clear,4
B00KD6ZHA4,"Easy to pour,drys fast",5
B00KD6ZHA4,excellent value,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Y al secar el papel no hay nada que lo despegue,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"Easy to apply, non-toxic, works like tacky glue (meaning it takes some time to dry so you can make adjustments) but honestly I find it's even better as fabric glue. I did a whole bunch of up-cycling projects with old denim vests and they're holding up beautifully",5
B00KD6ZHA4,"I use Aleene's Original Tacky Clear Gel as my primary glue for assembling laser cut projects. To be fair, I use this 8 ounce bottle to refill the Aleene's pen applicator once it ran low. I really like how tacky this glue is. It holds the part in place almost instantly yet will give you a minute or two to reposition if you make a mistake. I also love how easy it is to clean up: a damp paper towel will remove any undesired glue easily and I really mean easily. cleaning up joint squeeze out is fast and there will be no visible residue left over when it dries. While this is my primary glue for my projects, it doesn't do everything. I still keep a bottle of Medium CA as well as a bottle of ""Laser Cut Kit Glue"" which isn't very viscous (and expensive).I haven't tried this on other crafts (like fabric) but for laser cut wood, this covers 90+% of my needs and holds extremely well",5
B00KD6ZHA4,"I have been using Aleene's glue for many years for scrapbooking. I love this new type and I'm using it making cards, now, and it is wonderful! Easy to use and works great. Will definitely by again!",5
B00KD6ZHA4,Prompt delivery,4
B00KD6ZHA4,"Bonds strong enough on most materials,",4
B00KD6ZHA4,I had high hopes that this would be  cheaper alternative for me to use instead of some glue that I buy from stamp companies.  But it will not work in my fine tip bottles.  Still it works fine straight from the bottle and I will use it up.,3
B00KD6ZHA4,Always a reliable craft glue! Dries clear and pretty fast. Would buy again.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,A product that works,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"Good solid glue for card-making projects.If you need a shiny clear top coat, this glue also works perfectly for that.It needs a good 48 hours to fully cure, but after around 15 minutes, it is glued on pretty well.Being a water-based glue, it is also easy to clean up spills and accidental drips and such.This is my new favorite glue for paper and wood projects.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,Great glue no scent. Easy to remove from hands,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Great,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"Yo lo compre porque leei comentarios de que era muy bueno para pegar muchas cosas y entre esas pegar telas. Y no es asi. En mi laso queria utilizarlo para trapillos y no funciono en lo absoluto. No pego y aparte se quedo todo duro despues de q se seco. Asi q para este caso, no lo recomiendo. Quizas para otras cosas funcione por algo hay buenas opciones",3
B00KD6ZHA4,Glue is glue,3

I have another of Aileen's glue that I am happy with, so naturally went with this for a felt to foam project I had.It dried with a firm bond & remiains flexible. That's just what I wanted it to do. Just what I expected it to do.I have used it in a pinch for paper, because it was handy. Over leak dries a bit yellow, & isn't quite as flexible as one may think.The pictures & video are of the felt, not the foam project.",4
B00KD6ZHA4,"This tack glue is great because it gives me time to move my pictures around before they are permanent placed down. It is easy to use and have staying power. The quality,price and durable are fantastic.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,This glue works great on my arts and crafts projects.  It dries clear. It holds very well. No odor. Great price,5
B00KD6ZHA4,I used this to decorate a teachers door for teacher appreciation week. Had some heavy crafts that stayed out all week!,5
B00KD6ZHA4,La eh utilizado y tiene buena adhesion,5

B00KD6ZHA4,"I have used Aleenes clear gel Tacky Glue for over 25 years as my #1 all purpose glue.I pay $4.98 for an 8oz bottle at Jo-Anns fabrics here in Pensacola, Florida. So when I found this listing on Amazon, I stocked up.Last year I found I could, use a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of Aleenes ""Clear Gel"" Tacky Glue with Pledge revive it Floor Gloss, in mixing Deco Rom Mica Power (found on Amazon) to make paint.This mix can also be used as top coat for glitter to keep it from flaking off your project.After mix dries, it's hard to get off.I'm making fabric beads right now, I use the same 1/2 and 1/2 mix to stiffen my fabric so I can cut to size and roll into a bead. Once I get the bead made, I use 4 coats of, hard coat Mod Podge, then 1 coat of Judi Kins Diamond Glaze (Amozon purchase), for a gloss finish.I end up with a water resistant, glass like bead.",5

Adheres well and when used dries quick. Has a strong hold on material its used on plus shows up clear. Easy to use and clear if necessary.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Best glue I've ever used for putting appliques on crocheted items holds beautifully and continues to hold through  washing. But must remember to put weight on the item that you are gluing for a few hours for it to set. If you do this it works great,5
B00KD6ZHA4,It goes on nice and dries quickly.  I use it on paper and fabric crafts.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"this works as it should, easy cleanup, good adhesion",5
B00KD6ZHA4,I received this item today. I tried it for my diamond art canvas that has dried up in places. It does not work as it was advertised. I brushed it on as I was told. It made the canvas sleek when dry. It is crap. Aleene is a liar.,1
B00KD6ZHA4,"I purchased this for arts and crafts with a 6 year old. It holds well for simple crafts, better than glue sticks and white glue. Since the glue bottle has a tip and the glue is thicker than white glue, it's easy for a child to use without making too much of a mess. It's clear so it dries clear. We seem to use less glue so it lasts longer.",4
B00KD6ZHA4,"Trying the Aleene's gel for the first time and it's just too runny and makes a mess of my project.  I will just stick with their original white tacky glue, which dries clear anyways.",3
B00KD6ZHA4,"I usually use a different brand of glue called Tombow but I chose to try this instead and it's fine. It's got a nice strong grip on paper, foam ECT and it does dry 100% clear.",4

B00KD6ZHA4,"Works great as adhesive for my junk journal. Fabric, paper, and more.",4
B00KD6ZHA4,Sirve,4
B00KD6ZHA4,"I bought it so my Kid can do crafting without using the hot glue, but seriously you must wait for 15 or more minutes to get dry and glue",3
B00KD6ZHA4,I use it for my models and it does a great job,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"This is my favorite glue, period. Dries clear and I can use it for just about everything and it will hold well once dry.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,"This is by far my favorite glue, the only one I use. Love the clear.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,If u need a tacky glue this is the one holds part in place  u don't  need to saturate the things u glueing less is better I found to be true,5
B00KD6ZHA4,I bought this to repair some Velcro on a medical device and after 2 months it still holding firm. I would recommend wholeheartedly.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"Everything about this glue looks like it would be perfect. Good thick flow, easy spread. Was real excited about this one. It is, unfortunately, a pain to get it to actually glue things. As you can see after leaving the cloth under a weight attached to the wood for a few minutes it's still coming off.It sort of works, but you really have to put in the effort.",4
B00KD6ZHA4,Great glue!  Works very well!,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Jelly texture slippery when you apply to anything. Take a little longer to dry. I would not recommend for hairbow ribbon.,4
B00KD6ZHA4,"I have compared to local stores, and for price, much better deal, receive double amount of glue for price in stores! Always pleased with performance of this product. Dries clear, easy on!",5
B00KD6ZHA4,It gets the job done!,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Perfect quick dry.. perfect paper projects for the kiddos,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"I used this before & it worked really well, so I purchased it again. Sticks to & works well on most surfaces when allowed to properly dry & harden without excess manipulation. But to be sure it works for what you want to use it for do a test sample prior to using on entire project.",4
B00KD6ZHA4,"I bought this for use in a dollhouse project because i'd seen so many people use it on YouTube.my results were not at all what i expected.  it was NOT TACKY- worked only as well as any old glue, and cheaply made container doesn't even re-seal.  so it's probably not going to last very long.i bought the clear glue.  maybe the stuff in the brown bottle is better, but this is NOT GOOD",3
B00KD6ZHA4,I use this glue on pinecones to make miniature Christmas trees. Just a dab will do and it dries rather quickly.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Works great on paper products.  adheres well to 65lb cardstock!,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Good Buy will purchase again,5
B00KD6ZHA4,It's glue,4
B00KD6ZHA4,"With some research, I found that this is what you can use to glue replacement foam surrounds on paper speaker cones. I don't know about butyl rubber surrounds for newer speakers but this is the stuff to use for repairing surround on paper cones. No expensive tiny tube to ration and it works on so many other materials.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,This is one I hadn't tried before. Clear as glass. Perfect as usual!,5
B00KD6ZHA4,I just started quilling and this is the perfect glue to hold the quilled paper together.  I bought a food syringe and filled it with the glue and it works perfectly for setting just a small dab of glue where I need it.  It came on time and was very reasonably priced.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,I love this glue...works so well for the crafting I do.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Exactly what I needed.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,The perfect glue to do projects it goes on perfectly and when it dries it dries clear. Anytime I have to do a project I do it with this glue. I even used this glue with my daughters. We have done a lot of projects and we have alot of fun do it with this glue.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"This glue works, but it takes time to adhere.  And doesn't work on porcelain.",3
B00KD6ZHA4,"If you don't want a quick dry glue or don't care, get this it's a pretty good glue, it dries up clear",5
B00KD6ZHA4,Used for a project held up great.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Like,5
B00KD6ZHA4,I had carpet to laminate floor gaps and needed to tuck in the fabric fibers.  The application was really easy.,3
B00KD6ZHA4,The glue works well and is good for the price. Used for gluing artificial flowers on glass and it stuck well.,4
B00KD6ZHA4,"Tacky glue:It was not super strong but held up, also clear in color. I also liked that it was easy to remove especially after several days. Perfect for projects where you need something to stick for a few hours but not permanent.",5
B00KD6ZHA4,I really like this.  Stuck to my window really quickly.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,I needed clear glue to adhere fabric and ribbon in junk journal construction. This turned out to be best buy at the time. I was out of fabric glue and amazed at the great price so I purchased three bottles!,5

B00KD6ZHA4,We bought jewels to glue on to nieces dress. Unfortunately they stayed on until she put the dress on to take pictures.  Had to use super glue.,3
B00KD6ZHA4,This purchase was made because I can't find 8 oz in the box stores. They all seem to be selling 4 - 6 oz now and at a higher price that what I paid here. I've used Aleene's glues for years. They are perfect for my card making hobby.,5
B00KD6ZHA4,Great for diamond art work,5
B00KD6ZHA4,"Great to find a larger bottle of this glue  Works great ,dries clear!",5
B087HQPH7Z,"Found these at an ace store a while back.  Needed more and found them here.They are so simple to use,  and no Huge holes and some plastic or metal piece to dig out of the wall of you want to remove it.  Two tiny holes.  Also no worries about what's behind the wall. They hold everything i have tried to hang.  I don't push the upper limit of the weight,  but they seem to be very steady. Highly recommend!",5
B087HQPH7Z,We moved and are hanging our picturesin the new house using this product and it is fabulous! no fuss no muss no big nails hitting pipes or wires in the walls when hanging large or heavy pictures and you can do this with your fingers no hammer needed! Love it! it holds a very heavy mirror that use to have to use large bolts to hold now just one 45lb CLAW and that is it!!! Great deal for the price and the convenience of being able to hang heavy object with very little damage to your walls! P.S. They come out of the wall just as easy as putting them in and you can recuse them!!!,5
B087HQPH7Z,I love this product. Its easy to install and reposition without causing much damage to walls.,5
B087HQPH7Z,"I've been looking for a way to hang my framed pictures that had a sawtooth hanger on the back. I didn't want huge, nail-sized holes in the walls and the normal picture hanger hooks either didn't latch on to the sawtooth hanger or (if even it did manage to latch on) left the photo hanging in a tilted position off of the wall. I just didn't like the way this looked, and I was never fully certain the pictures were securely mounted. After much searching, I found these 3M claw hangers and decided to give them a try. They worked perfectly, and were very easy to install. I did use a leveler while positioning them onto the wall before pressing them fully into position. I used the holes previously placed by my old hangers to position the claw hangers; therefore, I had no need to use the wall markers the kit comes with. I saved them though for potential future use.I do agree that these are on the pricey side considering the amount you receive, but overall, I'm very pleased with the product and highly recommend others to buy it.",5
B087HQPH7Z,Love these for heavy picture hanging without extreme damage to the wall.Big problem: the markers do not stay stuck to the wall.,4
B087HQPH7Z,"Pros:Ridiculously easy to useGuide stickers are genius, we saved them to use with traditional mounting kitsSaves walls from bulky anchorsWill be easy to patch if we want to move the artCons:These will not work in plaster walls, drywall onlySeems a bit pricey for 8 hangers ($20.49 at time of purchase)Primary use:Hanging lightweight framed prints, largest is a few inches above a standard poster sizeWould I buy it again?Maybe, it  would heavily depend on the price",5
B087HQPH7Z,"My new Pic wall consisted of light canvas prints so I got 15Ibs. Also hung an 6Ib mirror. The hooks were so easy to install. Had to use a mallet hammer to press on a few that were over my head. They also pop out easily if you want to move them. Sturdy product. my pics were straight,  not the usual slant. Pics also flush to the wall. Looks professional. A bit pricey but I hung about 12 pics in under 15mins.  Most of the time ws figuring out how to arrange the canvas. That make it worth it to me! Will be buying more.Update: tried to buy more and the price doubled per 1 box. I will shop elsewhere.  Buyer beware",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I had doubts on how these hooks can hold up to 65 pounds. Well, they're as advertised! Easy to install and holding a 45 pound mirror like a champ. So much better than drilling, anchor and screw.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"Lost a few picture frames to shattering after they unceremoniously fell off the walls in the middle of the night. Had used the same wall hanging strips for hanging picture frames throughout the house (rental) but the ones in the guest hallway hang fine while the ones in the living/kitchen area all lost grip. The only difference I can figure is excessive oily debris from the gas range has accumulated on the walls resulting in poor adhesion.Enter the 3M claw. These are definitely not the cheapest hanging method but they are secure, they are fast, and they are reusable. Removing them leaves two tiny vampire fang marks in the drywall which can easily be patched with a toothpick amount of spackle and repainted with a sponge and you'll never know they were there. Neither will my landlord LOL",5
B087HQPH7Z,"This worked well to hang a large dry erase board. The board did not have a hanger on it, but it did have a lipped edge. These worked great to remedy a solution for hanging. Instructions were clear and came with sticky pads to align the marker correctly.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I love artwork.  I hate hanging it up.  Proof in point, I've had a collection of artwork I've been wanting to display in my office at work for probably 6 months and, even having discovered the 3M CLAW when I was getting frames for some of it, it's taken me this long to finally get them and to put up that artwork.  I was afraid that this product could not be as good as advertised.  I'm very pleased to now be able to report it is every bit as advertised.  And, the first as-advertised bit is that you really don't need any tools.  Certainly no hammer.  Just some firm pressure and the two claws pieces do the job for you.  Between the instructions, the features built into the claw, and the design of the multi-use nature of the spot markers, I found it very easy to hang up 4 pieces myself using just 1 of the 5 spot markers ... leaving me the other 4 if I ever need to move things.  Took me maybe 45 minutes total (including moving furniture out of the way and moving it back).  The process is surprisingly simple ... but ingeniously designed.  You arrange the spot marker on the back of the piece you need to hang based on how it will be hung.  You arrange the artwork on the wall and apply just enough pressure for the spot marker to adhere to the wall.  Remove the artwork and make a dot at the designated spot on the spot marker.  Remove the spot marker and now align that dot with the designated plate on the CLAW ... and once level, just press it in.  Once in, hang the artwork.  The entire process is based on just holding the artwork where  you want to it be when finished ... and the spot marker and CLAW naturally ""do the match"" to determine where the CLAW has to be for that to happen.  None of the usual headaches of having to do precise measurements and still hope you're close enough for things to look right.  While 1 piece was by itself ... 3 that I hung together aligned the way I was wanting them to so that was really nice.  Now that the primary pieces are in place, I can take in the rest and know how they'll have to go in relation to the initial group.  A follow-up task that I now look forward to instead of dreading.  Having used double-side tape or other such ""wall markers"" in other crude implementations of these wall spot markers, I know the overall idea isn't new.  But, for 3M to be able to start off with such a crude concept and to develop a formal system combining a simple but effective spot marker with their CLAW is just amazing.  And, is easily the best way I've seen yet to get something hung up easily, quickly, and accurately.  The fact they have them in different weight classes is another great feature.  I opted for the 25-lb set instead of the 15-lbs set because 1) I knew getting a set of the same class would be cheapest (I could get 2 packs for 10 total for less than a multi-pack of 8 total) and that 2) a 25-lb CLAW can hang anything that a 15-LB CLAW could even easier.  In my case, I had one large canvas, two tall framed prints, and then 1 large all-metal print.  The metal print was easily the heaviest ... but while I was certain it was less than 15 lbs, I was more comfortable doubling the weight capacity instead of being ""just below"" the limit.  The 45 lbs or 65 lbs options would probably be fore something really heavy like a mirror or small display shelf.  A great system with a lot of possibilities!  Glad someone finally figured out how to make such an idea a reality!",5
B087HQPH7Z,"At first was super skeptical but once I figured out installing one I was able to hang over 5 different picture frames of different sizes within a matter of minutes, all while my baby was sleeping. This was possible since the hangers are easy to install and require no loud hammering. Only thing is how the foam assistant applicators are really only good for one time use. Feels wasteful when it comes to that.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I bought a set of four 45lb ones, used - like new, $1 cheaper than a new one. It was just like new.I used two of them to hang a 30lb wall art. It was super easy to install.The great thing about this product is that it won't create a big hole in the wall and you can make an adjustment to the location if necessary. Very happy with my purchase.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"These things work! Really work! I had 3, very heavy...one solid wood but all 3 HEAVY! These things idk how but they do and very easy on the wall! If you're on the fence...GET THEM!",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I love these wall hooks.  Being a renter and single, I don't want to do the damage or spent the frustration getting the holes perfectly aligned.  These make hanging heavy art and mirrors so easy.  Literally took me 3 minutes to hang this large mirror, by myself.",5
B087HQPH7Z,Una gran ayuda sin necesidad de martillo,5
B087HQPH7Z,Absolutely the best! So easy!,5
B087HQPH7Z,This product works exactly as advertised.  You can just use your thumb to press the hanger into the wall and then hang your item up on it right away.  It is surprisingly sturdy and can probably hang weight in excess of what its listed at.  The best part is that if you make a mistake and need to move it: (1) it comes out of the wall really easily; and (2) you can barely see the old hole in the wall.,5
B087HQPH7Z,Work well easy to use,5
B087HQPH7Z,It's so easy to use.,4
B087HQPH7Z,"If you love your walls, get this. Great invention and one of the best product on Amazon. I bought them in many different sizes and they all are holding up great. Easy to install and I am fully satisfied.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I love this alternative to using nails! These can hold lots of weight, believe it or not, without making huge holes in your walls! I recommend this to anyone.",5
B087HQPH7Z,I like them a lot. Very easy to install to hang pictures.,5
B087HQPH7Z,Easy to put in wall without tools. Minimum hole left (small slithers) can take out and reuse. Command strips kept dropping the canvas. Product hides behind canvas so barely noticeable. Love it.,5
B087HQPH7Z,"I needed to hang several larger (but not excessively heavy) pictures in a room that we recently updated. I usually use drywall anchors because I  want to be confident that what I hang stays on the wall.As a part of the update I hung Type 2 wallpaper (fabric backed vinyl that's typically used in commercial areas) because I wanted something durable and did not want to do this room again. Consequently, I didn't want to drill big holes for anchors.  I tried these Claw hangers because it seemed they would minimize damage to the wallcovering while being strong enough to securely hold the pictures.These picture hangers were pretty easy to install. Because of the wallcovering I needed to punch small starter holes with a nail to make it easier to get through the material. I also used a small hammer to ensure the hangers were all the way into the drywall. Once in the wall they seemed very secure and I had confidence they would support the pictures. I'm satisfied with these hangers and I'm happy to have given them an try.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"These things are great. So easy to install, and do a great job of holding pictures/mirrors with minimal impact to the wall.",5
B087HQPH7Z,The best product on the market for hanging pictures hands down. Holds strong to the wall and easily removed with only two little slits in the wall to spackle. Easy to attach to the wall without marking the wall using a hammer or just pushing them in with your thumbs.,5
B087HQPH7Z,"Great purchase! Easy to use, minimal wall damage, solid mounting. Will purchase again.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"The clamps work well.  They are easy to snap on the dry wall and hold true to the weight they are rated to hold.  The foam locators that come with the clamps work terribly.  Difficult to pull paper from adhesive, and once you finally are able to do so, the adhesive used is not proper as the foam locator would stick to the picture frame and not transfer to the wall as illustrated on instructions.",4
B087HQPH7Z,"Easy to use, and are secure.  I do not feel like anything will fall off the wall.  The pictures I put up were not heavy, but they definitely worked well for me.",5
B087HQPH7Z,These are worth the price,5
B087HQPH7Z,"These are the easiest things to hang. They are sturdy and hold a lot of weight. And when done, the holes are so much smaller to fill then if you used a dreaded wall anchor that you need a drill for!",5
B087HQPH7Z,So easy to hang on drywall no worries of finding the stud.  Easy to remove leaves just two tiny holes.,5
B087HQPH7Z,They work really nice but they're way too spendy those long poke in ones are a much better  for the money,5
B087HQPH7Z,Super easy way to hang fairly heavy holiday decor from the walls and door frames!  Much better than command strips for those heavier items like garland and stockings!,5
B087HQPH7Z,Get these 100%. Super simple to use and get level. Work amazing. I even got the heavier variant for 50lbs plus NO PROBLEMS!,5
B087HQPH7Z,"These claw hangers are so easy to use.  Just find the spot, push the claw into the wall(I use a hammer) and hang your picture.  The pack comes with different sizes for different weights, which are clearly marked.  I have a very heavy mirror hung on the largest size claw, and it holds up great. This is the second pack of these I've bought.  Never going back to nails.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I purchased the 3M claw last year, before I went into an assisted living facility.  I am a bit elderly and do need assistance with daily living.  That said, I finally got around hanging my Terry Redlin framed and matted print in the apartment.It did a bit of time to get the Claws into the walls, and my right thumb is in pain, but they are in and my prints are up.  I purchased the 25 lb. Claws so there is enough strength for the prints.  So they should not have to pull out of the walls.  I should say, I did make sure to get the Claws completely into the walls, and again, I only used my thumbs.  Being somewhat disabled, that's saying something.The prints are up and look good, in my humble opinion, so I don't really have anything to complain about currently.  The 3M Claws (25 lb.) seem to be a good product, and I am pleased.  I will be purchasing more quite soon, as well as more framed and matted Terry Redlin prints.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"We should have purchased these years ago... but no, we kept fighting with the average picture hanging hooks and making endless larger holes in the wall after many attempts to hang pictures, clocks, etc...  No guessing with these... the wire just slides on... you don't even have to be looking at it!  After using these, we won't use anything else.",5
B087HQPH7Z,No drilling just push in the claws.,5
B087HQPH7Z,"These little things are amazing. Works great and leave little damage behind, however the hook is pretty shallow. I have a few frames where the backing sits in maybe a 1/4 inch, which makes it too ""deep"" for these to work, as it can't hook onto the hangar unless I replaced the wire to get more slack or something. It's really only good if you are hanging something that basically sits nearly flush to the wall",5
B087HQPH7Z,No,5
B087HQPH7Z,We just moved and I had to rehang all of our pictures.  I did some research to see what new is available.  I have some large pictures and I didn't want to damage the wall.  These are absolutely amazing.  They are so durable they will be reused for many years to come.  The most sturdy picture hanging I have ever seen.  Highly recommend.,5
B087HQPH7Z,"giving even numbers of each CLAW would be ideal, especially when using 2 per picture,poster, wall art etc.",4
B087HQPH7Z,More damage to drywall then expected,3
B087HQPH7Z,Really easy to apply and works really well!Was a good choice,5
B087HQPH7Z,Very sturdy,5
B087HQPH7Z,"Easy to use, a good assortment for different sized wall hangings, sturdy.  We lived in a home with CBC walls for years and years and dealt with the drilling, repairing and painting over any hangers we used, or needing two to hold onto a larger piece.  These are great, the biggest issue is using care in hanging multiple items along a wall because measuring needs to be done accurately so that they align the way you want them to.  We have hung acrylic prints and large and small regular framed prints and each worked well with these hangers.",5
B087HQPH7Z,Easy to use and hold a picture really well. Only downside is there should be more in the package for the money,5
B087HQPH7Z,"The spot markers did not peel properly when taking the cover off of the sticky part on the side with the red and white print. Which means you cannot use them because what happens is that when you peel the paper off, it also peels off the sticky part of the spot marker.I just now needed to order more of these excellent 3M hanger hooks and I DID,  but I wish we could be supplied with extra spot markers for the ones that end up not being usable or to have another option of buying extra spot markers separately. 3M, are you listening? I WOULD BUY THEM IF YOU DID.",4
B087HQPH7Z,"Easier said than done, ended up having to lightly pound it in with a mallet to get it completely flush and then used a flathead to bend the hook back into position. Little more work than a simple nail but it does look more flush to the wall.",3
B087HQPH7Z,"I've been happy with these.  They have held up my picture frames (small to medium) size with no issues over the years.  Easy to install as well, but pay attention to the actual clip location (ref instructions)",5
B087HQPH7Z,"Wow, just wow. Needed, rather wanted, to hang a heavy piece of metal art onto thin drywall. Figured I would try this before relocating it, assuming the claw would be returned after it failed. NO! One probably would have held it. But I used all three just for overkill to distribute the weight. Wow. I would have paid way more for these.",5
B087HQPH7Z,Easy to use but are a bit expensive,4
B087HQPH7Z,works perfectly,5
B087HQPH7Z,These things are amazing. Easy to press into the wall and they fit so snug. Absolutely perfect. Love the variety pack for different weight holding options. A bit pricey but so worth it.,5
B087HQPH7Z,Work like a charm,5
B087HQPH7Z,"Absolutely love these wall anchors. Fantastic design. I hope the inventors are sitting on a beach sipping cocktails for the rest of their days.Pros:- Easy to press in with your thumbs, and pull or lightly pry out when removing.- Only leaves 2 small snakebite holes in the wall, versus a larger round hole when using a traditional drywall anchor.- No drilling a hole, then hammering in the plastic expander, then screwing in the screw, then vacuuming the drywall powder up, then eventually removing the screw and anchor, then patching the hole in the wall.- Beats Command Strips as there's no fuss with the wall being smooth enough, or having issues removing the strips after they've been on the wall for a couple years and either leave behind a glue mark or rip and have to be scraped off the wall (along with the paint).Cons:- More of a consideration: As with most anchors, they hold weight when pulling straight down. Mind bulkier items that pull out and down on the wall so the anchor isn't at risk of wiggling out over time. Screw-anchors stay in the wall better when holding up items that pull a bit outward.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"These make it so easy to hang pictures, shelves and lots of other things.  The instructions are easy to follow and because I'm in an apartment, I have to keep the holes in the wall very small.My only caution advice would be to make sure that whatever you're hanging has a downward pull to it.  If the weight wants to lean outward from the wall, they will pull out of the wall.Great product though!",5
B087HQPH7Z,First time using this and I am so happy with it. Easy to use and strong. No mess. no fuss,5
B087HQPH7Z,These are very easy to use and align and leave a minimal hole on the walls2 of the smallest ones hold a 30lb mirror perfectly,5
B087HQPH7Z,"I originally found this product in store and after my initial experience with, I  feel in love with how easy it is to set up and install the 3M hook. I have used the full line up at this point and I have hung small picture and even full size heavy duty mirrors. All of the hooks have showed how sturdy they are and how well then maintain their weight .",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I bought: 3M CLAW(TM) 25 lb. Drywall Picture Hanger in 2023These worked great, I rather like the design for installs where I don't have convenient studs behind the drywall to put nails in.  The pictures and such mislead you that you can just push them in.  Not really.  You'll still need a hammer or some blunt object to provide enough force to penetrate the drywall.  I hung a 10lb glass art wood frame piece using two different claw pieces.  I feel like I bought the right size and could have easily gone to the next step smaller.I'll be using these for anything valuable from now on.  They seem far less likely to pull out of just plain drywall as compared to nails or screws.They also had some block guide thing which I found to be moderately useful to set the location, but as ever, wire slack is hard to calculate until actually hung, so I had to pull them out and re-install.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"Initially, I decided to call a professional to put up my art.  However, since I've used Claws to put up small things prior, I researched and purchased the 45 lb claws.  I wanted to be sure it would be secure.  It took a minute to line up the claws, but it worked once I measured and followed instructions!  My picture is 72 x 42. Very big!  I'm very pleased.  CLAWS are perfect, strong, easy to use and if you make a mistake, removable is simple too.  Love them!",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I was skeptical at first because I wasn't sure it would hold 65 lbs. I bought this to hang two large mirrors weighing 25 lbs each on drywall, and it holds up pretty well. It was easy to install and does the job. I would highly recommend it.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I hung up some African Art on my walls which had pocket doors behind them. If I drove nails in, they nails would have caught the door so that would have been a fail. I used the 65lb claws for items that weighted far less because I was nervous. You can imagine that I didn't want all my new sheetrock in my renovated room to be shredded.I'm so pleased!  As advertised, easy, no tools and voila.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I recently purchased a Drywall Picture Hanger with Spot Marker, and it has been a game-changer for my rented apartment. The picture hanger itself is amazing; it holds a lot of weight and leaves an accurate footprint. The best part is that the holes left after removal are minimal, making it easy to reposition without causing damage to the walls. This is a huge plus for someone renting, as I can now decorate my walls without worrying about losing my security deposit.However, the spot marker that comes with the hanger is not as accurate as I would have liked. It's a minor inconvenience, but it would have been nice if it were more precise. Overall, I'm thrilled with the picture hanger and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to hang pictures or decorations without causing significant damage to their walls.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"You can hang your picture or other object in seconds, if you have regular wallboard. Even if you make a mistake the tiny hole left behind is barely noticeable.There is nothing to dislike about this product, it's a great little product.",4
B087HQPH7Z,This is a very good product and easy to use. It leaves a minimal number of holes in my drywall but is very secure. Wish the hook part was a little bit bigger so that my picture Frame wire could catch it easy.,5
B087HQPH7Z,They were very simple to use and work great!,5
B087HQPH7Z,"These are great for hanging pictures or other things. The holes they make in drywall are practically invisible if you have to remove them. Easy to fix, just a drop of spackle (or toothpaste) and maybe a drop of matching paint. These 3M claw hangers are available for different weights of hangings and as long as your drywall is solid (not water damaged or banged up) these will work.",5
B087HQPH7Z,Easy to use and does what was described,5
B087HQPH7Z,"3M has another win. I moved to the desert, so my previous favorite command strips can dry out and fall off the wall. Found these, tried them and actually found a good tester online who compared the various options and they did well there too.So, work perfect and minimal damage. Very happy. This was my second purchase after buying a combo weight limit pack on sale to try them out.",5
B087HQPH7Z,"I was a bit skeptical about this product, and bought the starter pack so I had all the weight options for my heavier (~20lb) glass framed print.After watching some videos, I decided to use the 45lb hook and it was SO easy to install! I have drywall/plaster coated walls, so it took a bit of hammering to get it flush. The print is quite secure. The little markers that come included are amazing to help with placement.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,"I purchased these tools while working on a Christmas present that required chiseling out a holder for a medal. When they arrived, they were well-packaged and in excellent condition. I was able to use them right away without any issues, and they performed exactly as expected.The handles are well-sized with a comfortable, easy grip, and the blades arrived sharp and ready for use. They handled the project with ease and have since been used for a few other woodworking tasks with equally good results.For the price, these tools are a great investment. I would recommend them to anyone who regularly works with wood or to hobbyists looking for reliable tools for their next project.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,"These are very good chisels for the price. I am your normal home DIY type person and needed something to dig channels in wood for door handles/locks, etc..... I would recommend these for your normal household type uses. If I were a professional or needed to use these everyday, I would go with a more robust option....but these were perfect for my price and needs. They were sharp and easily made the gaps in the doorframes I needed for my lock installation.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,Great tools.Great price.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Worked just like it was meant to.  I recommend watching a video on how to properly use before going to far on a door like i did.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Good steel, sharp, holds edge",5
B07GGYNHSQ,"An excellent value, and reminds me of the older craftsman chisels. Sharp, well-made and inexpensive.Only 2 small things that reduce a ""star""1) the finish on the handles is good, but not quite as refined as they could be2) the sharpness holds well, but not great. After using one for a project, it was about as sharp as one of my finer tools that had 6-7 projects on it. I'd estimate it is about 10% dulled from new. So, it is a hobby-level tool, which is expected at the price.These are 2 very small drawbacks and would not make me hesitate buying it again.",4
B07GGYNHSQ,"First set of good wood chisels I've ever owned and had no idea how helpful they would be.  Had to move a strike plate on a door frame about 1/2"" for it to latch properly and this did the trick in no time at all.  Perfect sizing of them.  I wish they came in a pouch to keep them together, like the more expensive ones do.I'm not sure this would be perfect for a real contractor, or woodworker but for the occasional DIYer like me, it is perfect.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,They are sharp!,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Excelente producto. Muy burn material para trabajar,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Very sharp, good size assortment. I typically work with pine woods which are generally soft wood, so i can not speak to how these are on hard woods. For what i do, these are a perfect length for me, not too short-not too long.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,These are so great for such low cost. I needed them for a little job. The alternative was spending 2x the amount.,5

B07GGYNHSQ,Very well packaged and extremely sharp wood chisels.Highly recommend this seller and product,5
B07GGYNHSQ,This set of chisels is a nice selection of sizes.  You can't beat the price either.I have used one quite a bit and unfortunately the edges of it are really worn down already.But they're still worth the price and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.,4
B07GGYNHSQ,These are not high end chisels. They're perfect for the person who only needs a chisel once in awhile.,4
B07GGYNHSQ,"Just recently received these, so my reaction is based on initial impressions. They were well packaged, they have protective plastic sleeves on the business end and seem to be very well made. I've been wanting to replace my ages old wood chisels for, well, ages.

B07GGYNHSQ,"These wood chisels are a great value with getting four different sizes in the kit. They are very sharp and easy to hold. My old chisels had been abused over the last 30 years I've had them so it was time for new. These aren't professional grade so don't go slamming these things for what they are...these are a great addition to a DIY homeowner tool box for setting hinges and door latches, and wood projects primarily of soft to medium hardness woods. Grab these for a steal and you won't regret it.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,Muy buen producto,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Good variation of sizes. Curious to how well they resharpen.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Used them and found them to be very sharp. Would recommend for the price. Handles seem to hold up well when you strike them.  Comfortable in the hand. Good selection of sizes.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Needed to carve out a little space in some door jambs. These were very sharp and got the job done quickly. Didn't put them to extreme use like someone who does woodworking for a living might, but I suspect these will last me quite a while.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,high quality,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Very sharp and just what I needed. Made well and a good buy!,5
B07GGYNHSQ,I bought this to help chisel away excess concrete that my contractor put on numerous cracks. I was done with it in no time.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"These chisels arrived well-packaged and sharp out of the box.Like the protectors over the blades, both to keep them safe during delivery and for ongoing use.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,"This is a good starter set of chisels that in my case will be used to mortice door hinges.  For the price, it's well worth having new sharp tools in 4 sizes for other woodworking projects as well.  They come with blade covers so they won't cut you when you have them in your toolbox and they feel much like more expensive ones.  For the price, it's hard to beat this set.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,haven't had a new set of chisels for 15 years. Great to have sharp and true tools,5
B07GGYNHSQ,The sizes in this set were perfect for my project. Great quality and durability. Comfortable to work with and hold a good grip on the chisel. They appear to be very well made.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,perfect for rough woodwork. holds up pretty good to normal hammer strike. nothing broken yet,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Exactly what was needsd,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Basic,  decent quality chisels for a decent price.  Are they world class instruments well,  no.  But you're not paying for world class.  Perfectly adequate for the average home owners toolbox. Seem like they'll last a long time with occasional use.  A+",5
B07GGYNHSQ,These are well made,5
B07GGYNHSQ,A pleasure to work with.  Very surprising considering the price.  Really glad that I bought them.  Just needed to install some strike plates on a few door frames.  I liked the larger handles too.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Tool arrived same day which is always great! They are of a great quality and arrived sharp/ready to use!,5

B07GGYNHSQ,GOOD PRODUCT,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Received them in a neat little box all lined up by size, I have been using these for about a year & have little damage to the actuall metal. Will need to sharpen after a while because they will dull out & make it hell tryna use them.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,Very good quality and one more size comparing to most brands.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Perfect size for my amateur furniture repair projects.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,OK works fine OK,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Very high-quality at a very reasonable price highly recommend this,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Good handles and good edges,5
B07GGYNHSQ,I am just a DIY person so I hate to rate tools like these because a real professional may not think they are very good quality.  They seem to be good quality for my use though.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Good chisel for my woodworking project,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Using these chisels on my door lock was an absolute pleasure. The set allowed me to remove the necessary material with precision and accuracy. The blades cut smoothly, ensuring clean and neat cuts without any damage to the lock or surrounding area. I was able to achieve a professional-level finish, thanks to the exceptional performance of these chisels.What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in the design. The chisels had ergonomic handles that provided a comfortable grip, allowing me to work for extended periods without discomfort or strain. The weight distribution was well-balanced, giving me optimal control over each cut",5
B07GGYNHSQ,Well I cut my hand so yes they are sharp lol,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Not as i expected.,2
B07GGYNHSQ,I needed a quality chisel set for a door latch that needed to adjusted.  This set was perfect in using and even came with edge covers to protect when not in use.  They handled great and did not have any issues with use.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"This is a very good, solid and well made set of Chizels... I've only used it once on a door jamb and it did the job well...",5
B07GGYNHSQ,I've hit these things with hammers and nothing breaks for the money they're really good,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Durable for any wood working situation you need them for. We'll made and hold together well. Great product.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"I was putting a new doorknob on aninteriorI was putting a new doorknob on an interior door and found that the strike plate had to be repositioned. I had an old wood chisel but it would have to be sharpened. It was easier to buy these, particularly with prime shipping. I used two of these chisels to rework the door jamb for the strike plate. I like that each chisel has its own blade guard.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Well weighted chisels that are an option for one-use applications. For the price of these chisels, they can be a cost-effective option compared to the cost of a buying a sharpening stone kit and the associated time to keep on sharpening chisels after each use.I used these to clean up mortise and tenons for a table base. Material was pine so not ideal but, they worked as intended. Sharp out of the box and come packaged in a cardboard box and individually wrapped in plastic.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,These wood chisels are good for the price. Entry level to get yourself started. I have a nice wood chisel from a named brand bout 20 years old that does just that little bit extra but cost quite a bit more.Really it comes down to the feel of the chisel and how well it takes impacts over years of use. These I would be surprised if they really stayed together from the abbuse that I'm going to put them through. The real thing comes down to the price for the amount of abbuse. I am going to probably buy them again due to the fact that they are cheaper and will last a while and I could buy 4 sets for the cost of my other 1 set of 4.Hope you enjoy them as well and keep in mind that the feel for me is through my gloves and that is why I like them.,4
B07GGYNHSQ,"They are made solid steel, extremely sharp, sleek looking, works perfectly for chiseling of my door.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,Best for wood Working and scarping things like floor tapes.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Very durable and sharp. Would recommend.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,They work well for what I need them for.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"So... this is my first set of chisels. I didn't want to break the bank, as I'm not planning on doing any fine work in the bear future. I've mostly been using these to get thick bark off of live edge pieces. They worked really decent out of the box with a good edge..... then I dropped the largest one on the shop floor and put a good knick on the edge. So I pulled out the stone and gave them all a good once over. They sharpen up nice. One thing I learned in my recent experience with woodworking: chisels and plane names will often need honing right out of the box, the cheaper the blade the more work it'll need. I got a cheap plane from ""that cheap tool store"" and I can't get it to hold a decent edge to save my life. These chisels are great if you just need a decent set for odd woodworking projects.",5
B07GGYNHSQ,Received the chisels quickly. They were very sharp and ready for use out if the box.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,Good quality tools. Works for home projects,4
B07GGYNHSQ,Works!,5
B07GGYNHSQ,I am an occasional word worker and do small projects and these are exactly what I needed. They may not be something a pro would use but they are sufficient for me and strong enough to be used with a hammer and the types of wood I used.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,these chisels are very sharp and durable . I'm impressed of the quality of these chisels.,5
B07GGYNHSQ,"Wood chisels, great for chiseling wood... if a wood chiseler wants to chisel wood...",4
B07XFJ5YKN,"These mats provide a large easy-to-clean surface. Works as a hot glue gun mat because of the heat resistance and the glue pops right off when cool. I use these for all my crafts. Cured resin peels off without leaving any residue, acrylic paint and dried plaster of Paris wash off with warm water, a drop of dish soap and light scrubbing. Quality product and a great price point mean I will be buying more as they are a perfect drying/ curing surface too. I highly recommend these.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"Although, they are a little thin. These are perfect for working with resin crafts.I'm giving a couple away in a class I will be doing.Not only great for crafts but, you can use them for dishes, etc for air drying.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"These serve their purpose however they feel as if they are too thin and makes ot hard to handle them. They stick to themselves since they are so thin. I expected them to be thicker. They are heat resistant, easy to remove messes on them, and easy to store while not in use. My rating is a 4 because they are so thin that it interferes with handling them.",4
B07XFJ5YKN,"I absolutely love these 3 Pack Silicone Mat Large Silicone Sheets! I've purchased them three different times, and they have been perfect for all my resin projects. The size is just right, nothing sticks to them, and they are so easy to clean. Highly recommend these mats for anyone looking for a reliable, durable, and easy-to-use option for crafting!",5
B07XFJ5YKN,Great value. The mats are a bit thin but work well for my purposes.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"I had a set of these silicone, protective sheets before and used them until they wore out.If you are doing acrylic resin or plaster casting, these are fantastic.Slops will not penetrate, and the sheets are easy to clean up. Just let the material dry, flex the mat, and viola.I am a huge fan of these mats, and I think that you will be too.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,These are mats are nice sized and keeps your project clean and helps you to stay clean in one area.  A must have if you are learning epoxy and resin crafts,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"These sheets are great! Large enough to protect any mishap. Saves your table from paint, Citrastrip, Armour Etch, or whatever other messy substance you are working with.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,Bought these because I started using resin. Love them. Protects the desk top. Easy to clean.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,Well these don't easily remove glitter but you can wash them in the washer and that helps. I have used them for painting and other crafting and they help protect the table so nice. I'm going to order another set.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,These mats were great. They were wonderful for my resin craft. They were slightly smaller than I thought they were but for the space I have they worked beautifully.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,Buena calidad,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"These were a little smaller than I needed, they're about the size of placemats for your table. I didn't want to invest more money until I tested these. They're easy to store, they don't slip while working with them, if large enough, they will protect surfaces and they clean well. I'm ordering the larger ones for the girls to use with their projects.",4
B07XFJ5YKN,"If you use a glue gun, paint crafts, or even have children that want to play with playdough, get these.  Protects the table or surface, and makes clean up a breeze.  Different colors help too.  The best thing, they are not huge, just right for a craft project or a child to use (even for early ""learning to feed myself"" events).",5
B07XFJ5YKN,Perfect size for what I need. The quality and the price are also great.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,these work great for what they were made for,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"These silicone mats work as they should and provide a non-stick surface, which is exactly what I needed for my resin and craft projects.However, they are smaller than I expected, so be sure to check the dimensions before purchasing as the term ""large"" is subjective. They are also thinner than I anticipated. Despite these minor issues, given the price, they work well for my needs. Plus, they are bright and colorful, which my daughter appreciates. I would buy them again.",4
B07XFJ5YKN,I used this for epoxy resin in my garage and it works really well. I've never used one really before as I just got into resin but it seems to be worth the price. It really protected the workspace although you may want to make sure it's big enough for you workspace. It also rolls up nice to store which is a bonus. I also super love the fact that it comes with 3. This product is really good and I would recommend it.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,It says large but doesn't even fill a large cookie sheet. I had to use two to fill it. It works well with the resin and come off easily. It does cling to whatever smooth surface you put it on.,3
B07XFJ5YKN,I love the size but so thin they stretch and make misshapen when cleaning them. Other wise would have been perfect,4
B07XFJ5YKN,I love these mats for resin projects! Great value for the money. I have bought these before over a year ago and those mats are still going strong! They provided good protection for the surface I am working on. I have used them for staining and painting projects and for my resin. They are so easy to clean and look great! I recommend these mats for crafting and resin projects.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,My only wish is that it would be longer since I have to put them end to end,5
B07XFJ5YKN,A little thin from what I have purchased before on here.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,i use these for my business they work great,5
B07XFJ5YKN,I use these to protect my desktop from some chemicals including uncured resin from 3D printing. The bright colors also help with visibility of small parts when disassembling various devices.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"Definitely reusable. Non stick. Colors are pretty. Bright. The sheets provide a large work area, but are on the thin side. However, they serve their purpose well.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,Son buenas  mas no excelente ya que se quedan como quiera con mucho residuo,4
B07XFJ5YKN,Saved my desk from getting epoxy on it!!,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"They can be used as soldering mats in case your soldering on or near your project.It can be used as protecting surface when using C.A. glue, or epoxy.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,We needed something to line our cookie sheets to freeze food stuff in our freezer before we bag them and these work wonderful and a great price too,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"No more gluey table. Super convenient, when dirty or sticky just wash and reuse. Wish I would have had one of these mats years ago.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"They are thin, very thin, but that's what I wanted so they are perfect for my use.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,They work great.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,I use Resin to seal and coat rocks that I've painted.  I use these Silicone mats to let the resin dry.  The mats allow the rocks to be lifted right off without any problem.  Smooth.  I recommend these mats for other projects as well.  Give them a try.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,Really like these.  Use them to put really hot pots or plates on a quartz countertop.  They really protect the countertop.  Since quartz is not supposed to hold up to really hot items figured to give these a try and they do work really well.  I would highly recommend this product.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,These would be great as placemats. They are thin but clean easily and are the perfect size for that use. Good product just not right for my intended use.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Probably better for crafting but worked out for being waterproof and what I needed them to be,4
B07XFJ5YKN,"Not good for resin. At first I thought they were going to be great, but the are very thin. All the mats I have can very easily be picked up and laid back down very easily. They stick really well, too well. If you are going to use them one maybe 2-3 times they will work, but I do not suggest them if you are wanting a mat to use regularly. I pulled dried resin off of the mats and it pulled at the mats much more than it should. I got uncured resin on them and there was no way I was cleaning it up and tossed them. I know the uncured resin is my fault, but I cleaned the same mess off my other mats and it was a much easier process and I didn't need to throw them away.If you are doing other crafts, I think these would be just fine. But because resin is listed I want to mention, skip if you are doing resin!",3
B07XFJ5YKN,"This is IDEAL for crafting.  Paint and glue come right off; there's definitely no fear of anything sticking!  Cleanup is SO much easier that I wish I would've bought this years ago.  Also, unlike some other reviews that complained, mine did NOT have any kind of permanent creases from the shipping.  There was a slight line when first taken out of the package but it flattened out right away.  There was no smell either.The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because it's so thin that a lot of heat transfers through to your table surface..  While this mat is certainly heatproof (I laid my hot glue gun right on it with no issues), your table might not be, so still exercise some caution.  It hasn't proved too much of an issue thus far, so I still highly recommend this product, especially since it costs a lot less than the equivalent I've seen elsewhere.",4
B07XFJ5YKN,"With these lightweight and durable silicone mats, I can work on any level surface. They are easily portable and take up little space in a bag. The bright colors make it easier to see my materials and to take pictures of items. Pieces that would usually roll around are stable. Also, clean up is a breeze! Just wipe off the mats with a damp cloth or cleaning wipe. These are a game changer and I would definitely recommend to friends or fellow crafters.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,I bought these mats to use with polymer clay crafts. They are brightly coloured and visible pleasing. They keep my furniture clean and are easily cleaned after use. They are made of silicone which is great. I would have scored them as 5 stars if they felt a little thicker. I would buy them again in a heartbeat though.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,"I work a lot with epoxy resin and these are amazing for covering my table!! My only problem is that I wish they were bigger, but I just lay out all 3 at once and make sure I'm over top of them. They're SUPER easy to wash. I usually let the epoxy cure on them so that I can just peel it off. (also super satisfying). I use these too for when my daughter wants to paint. We don't like to use disposable stuff, so these are perfect because I can lay these down and they come clean SUPER easy with soap and water. I've even thrown mine in the dishwasher.",4
B07XFJ5YKN,"These mats are ok but don't last very long, if you really have to scrub them the rubber starts to come away. Size for small projects there great. Resin comes of them easy enough,  they do stain but doesn't transfer on to other projects.  Stays in place fairly well overall its not a bad item to have in the craft room.",3
B07XFJ5YKN,thank you,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"Lays flat, slip resistant",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"i was hoping to use two of these mats for resin and one for baking.  the mats came folded in half then rolled up, so each mat has a crease in the middle that i can't remove & none of them will lay flat, even after unfolding them and putting them under a heavy bin for a while.  wouldn't be as big a deal for baking, but makes a difference for my resin projects.they're very thin & even a tiny pull makes the silicone turn immediately white, so i wouldn't trust these as food-grade silicone & would not use them for baking.  i paid less than $4 apiece for each mat so i'm not really surprised at the low quality, but even just shipping them rolled vs. folded would have made a difference for me.  i would not buy these again, & i'm really glad i didn't spend more on them than i did.",2
B07XFJ5YKN,"These are nice and color is pretty, but it sticks to itself and is thin.",4
B07XFJ5YKN,"I did not want to mess up my table with the color dyes used in the slime making process and these mats were perfect sized for the littles. The mats protected my tabletop and kept a mess down to a minimum with just as easy cleanup process. The shipping was fast, and they roll out and up just as easily. For me and my table this purchase was worth every single penny.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,I bought these to line the trays I use for transporting 3D prints from the printer to the wash station and as a table cover when gluing and gap filling.These work well for my needs but they are paper thin and I don't expect a long lifespan for them.Resin can easily be cured on them and is easily removed. The same for epoxy and CA glue (BSI quick set causes an odd bubbling reaction but the material resets after evaporation).They work well for my needs at the moment but when they wear out I will be replacing them with thicker mats.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,I used these for a crafting workshop and they are durable and stick great to the table. Im disappointed and upset because two of my packs are missing a mat so only received two in each pack when the listing indicated there were 3 total.,3
B07XFJ5YKN,"I have an SLA 3D printer (the one that uses all that messy resin). I've started laying these down before cleaning and trimming my prints. Resin can drip on these, and you can even let it sit dirty for as long as you like. Once you're ready to clean, everything just slides off. My wife stole one of the 3 mats for her projects, too. The last one I use for a work mat when I'm mixing and applying two-part epoxy. Again - doesn't stick. If these get lost or damaged, I'll definitely order more - great value.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,I use these on my table for when I'm doing my crafty stuff my hot glue gun or any kind of painting everything washes right off of this thing. I gave one to my daughter after she kept drooling over mine because it was so easy to take care of and protect my surfaces while I'm crafting I would recommend these get these get them they're awesome,5
B07XFJ5YKN,Glad to have something to roll dough on and not move. The mat stays in place,5
B07XFJ5YKN,Great protection for work space,5
B07XFJ5YKN,Great for crafting as nothing seems to stick to them just clean with soapy water and they are like new again. They stick to your table surface a little bit so they don't slide around. You can cut them with normal scissors  if needed.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,I don't expect so thin. I'd a similar color at home. It is almost double the thickness of this product. I use it for insulating a reptile heat pad. Not sure it can fulfill the job or not.Not recommended.,2
B07XFJ5YKN,These mats are perfect for working with resin,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"Nothing sticks, perfect size for cookie sheets and rasy cleanup",5
B07XFJ5YKN,Much smaller than I thought.,3
B07XFJ5YKN,I do so many different crafts. This rubbery piece stays put and helps hold things in place. I had previously ordered from Temu but the quality suffered with the lower price. Not a good deal. But I do recommend the pack of three from Amazon.,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"My daughter uses them constantly.  She paints, crests resin designs and other art projects.  Easy clean up.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,Great color. Great size. Good price. Easy to clean. Folds great. Protects great. Great quality,5
B07XFJ5YKN,These work well for my littles. Most substances clean off easily but the back does cling to hair and fluff.,4
B07XFJ5YKN,I got this so I had some extras for my resin table and my toddler could play with his play dough on it instead of leaving play dough in the wood grain of my desk. He loves using the mat and has even used it to help mold his play dough into certain shapes he wanted,5
B07XFJ5YKN,"My silicone crafting mats I have from other makers and especially Tim Holtz are larger and easier to work with. This is fine if you're looking for a smaller surface to layer paper craft projects on, I wouldn't say don't buy it in other words. I also cops thought it came with three mass and maybe it did but I'm remembering only finding one now, make sure if it shows three it comes with three",3
B07XFJ5YKN,"I bought these to protect the table when doing resin crafting and they work very well. They stick a bit to the table which is good, but remove easily. I also like that you can wipe them off with a wet cloth and they clean up well. I recommend for any crafters.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"I use these to prevent damage from spills when pouring epoxy resin. I've also used them to make my own molds by applying them to wooden molds I, so the resin releases. That's second use has been only partly successful. It's hard to keep these sheets flat when attached to wood because they don't adhere to glue very well. The shapes that result have been a bit wavy.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"Sticks to play dough and kinetic sand. Easy to wash and fold in the sink, but not what I was expecting it to be and be used for.",3
B07XFJ5YKN,Toddler is very messy and I use these under her plates/ bowls and it makes cleaning up after meals so easy!,4
B07XFJ5YKN,"Nice, got package just as advertised.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"These are super thin. They are great for resin work etc., which is what I bought them for. I have since switched creative directions and am trying to find a use for them. They are so thin it's worth noting that these aren't an alternative to more expensive silicone mats for heat resistance or cutting on, but they are everything the description says they are. They're even a bit tacky feeling on one side so they stay in place on your work surface and don't slip around or kink up.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"I see most reviews are for craft uses, but I use these mainly in the kitchen. I have cut one of the 3 sheets into various sizes. I fold them and store in a Zip lock bags (quart to gallon) to keep off dust as they have a static cling type effect.  I use the small ones as jar grippers, I made circle ones to serve as liners for my Air Fryer, safe to 445 degrees (the sheets are floppy so you could even push down as sort of a bowl to cover the sides if needed), I use different sizes as microwave dish covers (I make them taught rather than droopy by folding the ends under the container), I use some as cookie sheet and pizza pan liners, and I lay it on my lap table as a chopping board. Used for these purposes, the sheets are quite cost-friendly.",5
B07XFJ5YKN,"I didn't realize how thin these were. While they cover my craft desk fine, I'm not sure they'll last. I'll update my review in a few months.",3
B07XFJ5YKN,Nice yet too small to craft on.,3
B002NQ2K16,"My three kids love creating art in this book, Canson XL mixed media. All of them got one for Christmas. They use every page to create art. The book always holds up to the medium that they're using whether it is pencil, pen or paints. We will buy again once they use all the pages.",5
B002NQ2K16,I needed this size for a class. Paper is nice and thick enough for acrylics.,5
B002NQ2K16,Great quality and a great sketch book!,5
B002NQ2K16,This was for my 7yr old art class and it is perfect size to complete a piece each lesson. And paper quality is very good. Definitely worth buying,5
B002NQ2K16,"Dinged a star because packed in soft-sided brown envelope, and spiral binding got a little smushed, causing cardboard back to fall off. Able to reattach and (I think) bend spiral back so things will hopefully stay put.This is my 2nd of this item (originally purchased locally). Nice paper and size that I used primarily for acrylics.",4
B002NQ2K16,"Buying this on Amazon instead of in the local craft stores saved me a couple of dollars - even with the coupons or sales.Medias I have tried:Acrylic paint - I have made a few color mixing charts which is juts small squares of blended colors of acrylic paint. The paint sticks to the paper well, but if you look at the back of the page you can see the distortions and warping from the moisture of the paint. I haven't decided if I am gutsy enough to do an entire painting on this paper. If I do, I will tape it down to help prevent warping.Water colors and water color pencils - I am lumping this together since it involved adding a lot of water on top. This performs pretty well for these. But, again we have slight warping of the paper. It seem to work much better than standard card stock out of the package when using with water colors - significantly less warping. If you are applying a small amount of water colors you will probably be happy. If you are doing a lot and trying to layer up we, just buy watercolor paper. Taping it down should help as well.Pencils and colored pencils - This works great for these dry medias! I also tried it with standard ball point pens and was happy.Water based markers - I used some random target brand marks, Crayola, and Stablio markers on this paper. I liked how it worked. Again, like the other wet medias if you soak the paper with wet it can warp. But, its thick enough you shouldn't have any bleed through. My Stablio markers are super fine point and I use them for drawing and loved them on this paper. But, I am happy with them on most paper. The thicker school supply type markers performed pretty well as well.Overall, if you need a multimedia pad or sketch book, this will keep you happy! If you are looking for use with a specific media, you may want to look into pads formulated for those specific medias. And, with the awesome prices on Amazon, I will be back when I need another one of these.",5
B002NQ2K16,Got this one for one of my students and as always Canson delivers quality,5
B002NQ2K16,Canson is my go to for mixed media paper. I have purchased this numerous times in a variety of sizes.The 5.5x8.5 inch pad was purchased for travel. This paper will take a bit of light watercolor as well as pencil & ink.,5
B002NQ2K16,Came as described. Excellent product great quality,5
B002NQ2K16,Seems to be very good quality. Heavy duty cover. Sturdy,5
B002NQ2K16,"I'm learning how to watercolor paint folds in clothing and worked this paper to death. The paper isn't damaged from going over and over a spot, it doesn't soak through, and the paper does warp but it's not bad. Pencil will erase if not to dark, markers don't bleed through. I bought this for art classes that includes drawing, watercolor, charcoal, ink and markers and I like that I can now keep everything in 1 binder.",5
B002NQ2K16,Zentangle,5
B002NQ2K16,"This is a great quality product, good value for the money, texture is smooth which doesnt affect the details of what you draw or sketch, absorbs well",5
B002NQ2K16,"It's a good substantial paper. I thought it was a fair price for the quality and quantity, and I do like it, but it is not especially rough or textured.",4
B002NQ2K16,Great and leakproof,5
B002NQ2K16,"This is a standard and good quality product for mixed media on large size paper. Unfortunately in shipping the pad was not protected and all the paper on one side has a fold at the top which means it has to be cut off and that will make the pages smaller, which removes it from being a standard size for framing. The package I received was torn and damaged in several ways. However I kept the merchandise because it is so large and unwieldy that returning it creates a problem for I have no new box to replace the damaged one. Perhaps if you order it you can do so through a person and not online, and specify the need for better packaging.",5
B002NQ2K16,"I have used pencil, graphite, colored pencil (both normal and water colored ones), acrylic paint, line art pens, ball point pens, and prismacolor markers on this sketchbook. All have worked rather well- the paper is water/liquid resistant enough not to peel the paper, but marker tends to bleed through to the next page at times. I love the texture of the paper. This has become my go-to sketchbook. It's absolutely worth buying again; I've bought at least 4 of them by now.",5
B002NQ2K16,"Notebook pages are great, will work fine for the purpose intended. However, the cover/back had wear from storage on them. The cover had a silly sticker on it that will be super annoying to remove. See pic. Little disappointed, which is why it isn't a 5 star review for me.",4
B002NQ2K16,I use this notebook to do sketching and some acrylic painting. I have never had anything bleed through. This paper is perfect for everything in my opinion except for colored pencil just because of how the surface is a little more rough. I like the perforated line for when I want to take pieces out of the notebook and give them out.,5
B002NQ2K16,"Can't go wrong with Canson for drawing pads, or even for final projects.The 7 x 10 is the best size for a backpack or book bag.",5
B002NQ2K16,One of the best sketch books I usually buy. They never cease to amaze me.,5
B002NQ2K16,able to use this to draw or use pastels. A good mixed use paper.  I have been mostly using pencils as I teach myself to draw!,5
B002NQ2K16,"I bought 3 of these cause. They were such a good quality. I love them. They're the nicest size I could ever imagined they're nice and big. They're not too big, not too small, they're easy use",5
B002NQ2K16,My little artist loved it!,5
B002NQ2K16,"This paper buckles a lot when you use acrylic paint on it. I still use it for my students' acrylic paint projects, because it's inexpensive. For other mediums, such as watercolor or color pencil, it is decent enough. For my own acrylic paint projects, I prefer to use a heavier multimedia paper.",4
B002NQ2K16,"I've tried just about all drawing and mix-media paper on the market and Canson is by far the best, in my opinion. I work mainly in graphite and I love the smoothness of this mixed-media paper. It's not quite as smooth as regular drawing paper, as drawing paper does give me the beautiful smearing and blending outcome I desire with graphite, but this mix-media paper is more sturdy and blending goes very well on it. I no longer try different pads for drawing, Canson XL series is my choice of drawing paper.",5
B002NQ2K16,The sketch book is Very nice and good quality. The page is thick is exactly I wanted,5
B002NQ2K16,Love this brand of sketch book. Spiral is super durable. The paper doesn't bleed through. Great for most media(idk about water color haven't tried),5
B002NQ2K16,Good quality. Great price. The art tteacher recommended this one. It arrived right on time for the first day it was needed in class. My young artist loves it.,5
B002NQ2K16,"I draw with alcohol-based markers and it can be hard to find paper that can really hold the ink without any bleed, but this is the one. Super high quality without being stiff like watercolor paper.",5
B002NQ2K16,grandson loves it!,4
B002NQ2K16,"I have successfully used this paper with watercolor, colored pencils, ink, and pastels and markers with good results and little to no bleed through on watercolor or markers. But it is my practice and studies pad/journal. It is a nice white color and easy to tear out pages. I believe the picture is swatches of oil pastels. This is my second one I bought.",5
B002NQ2K16,The suppose serrated edge was only marked but you have to use an xacto knife to cut the pages out. I won't buy again!,3
B002NQ2K16,"my go-to sketchbook, no complaints",5
B002NQ2K16,I picked this pad for my grandson because I wanted some things that can be used with a variety of mediums and this was a good quality and a good price,5
B002NQ2K16,My daughter spends most of her free time drawing. She loves Cannon Mixed the best. She says the quality is better than alot of the others. She likes the ring binder because it's easier to use without bending the pages. They are priced on the high side but worth the money.,5
B002NQ2K16,"I bought this mixed media pad so I could practice my watercoloring. The paper is thick and has minimal warping when used for watercoloring. I am thoroughly impressed at the quality for what I paid. I will purchase this again, because I've used up almost the entire book. Give it a try, you won't be sorry you did!",5
B002NQ2K16,Sturdy and arrived fast,5
B002NQ2K16,Sorry the photo isn't the best but I wanted to show you what I got with the black Canson artist pad that wasn't mixed media but the black drawing pad in the same size to note the huge difference in how many pages you actually get. It's almost double in size for the same size 7x10. The diff was the black book is 92lb and the white was 98lbs so heavier duty too.i ordered mixed media. I do have to say one minor problem that is the use of the claim it is ok to use any mixed type media on the pages isn't all that true. I used chalk markers I got off Amazon on a page and it did start to get wavy a little bit. But after it dried I couldn't or didn't notice this anymore so I'm not sure why it does this drawing on it then dries excellent but it is a win win definately!!!,5
B002NQ2K16,"I love this brand, I have the same thing in a smaller size, so knew what I was ordering. There is no problem with the sketchbook, except it has a definite curve at one of the corners. I'm assuming it's the result of how it was stored in the warehouse, or in the delivery truck. It also had what appeared to be webbing on the outer edge, and possibly a smooshed spider included, sticking some of the pages together. Again, I'm chalking this up to how it was stored in the warehouse, and whoever packaged it didn't notice it.I will definitely buy this brand/product again, but will more than likely buy it from a store where I can make sure it's not bent or webby.",3
B002NQ2K16,Es grande y con buena cantidad de hijas para dibujar es de calidad .,5
B002NQ2K16,Great but arrived after a week took forever,5
B002NQ2K16,"I wanted something I could sketch, but also throw down some watercolor without a problem. It is a larger size but is still compact enough to bring with me to work everyday.",5
B002NQ2K16,I ordered twice of this item and both delivery are good. Nothing broken at all. The size of this item is bigger and flat. The seller packed very well to protect this item.,5
B002NQ2K16,Era lo que se buscaba y excelente calidad del material,5
B002NQ2K16,Muy buena calidad y la entrega super rapida.,5
B002NQ2K16,"Not too big, not too small. Durable, forgiving paper. Thick and everr so slightly toothed. Great little sketch companion.",5
B002NQ2K16,"It's pretty good, the only problem I have with it is that markers can bleed through. That's about it, 10/10.",5
B002NQ2K16,This paper is excellent for all artist mediums. Quality is great. Excellent value.,5
B002NQ2K16,Great for practicing crayon drawing.,5
B002NQ2K16,"Bought this for an art class.  Felt like it was a pretty good price for how much paper you get.  I am definitely not an art expert, but this did what it needed to do",5
B002NQ2K16,"The paper quality is something I enjoy. I finished a sketchbook from the same brand, so I really like it because of how many mediums I can layer on. I mainly bought it to color with my markers, and I think it prevents it from bleeding through quite well. However, I took off 2 stars because the sketchbook was damaged. It's nothing too bad, but it does annoy me.",3
B002NQ2K16,"I have been using ""Canson"" for many years...now that my son asked me for some paper to draw I got a little book of Canson to start. The quality matters!",5
B002NQ2K16,"I'm no pro, but I'd say:  Not for professional work.  Great for ideas, doodling with most media, or less important artwork.  Too expensive for kids to just scribble in, perhaps, but I love the weight of the paper.  It will curl some with wet media like watercolours but the only bleed through is with very wet inks and alcohol ink.",5
B002NQ2K16,"I love this brand. A friend of mine that is also an artist gave me some of her mixed media paper and I love the quality. So when purchasing this product online, I was curtain I was going to receive a great product.",5
B002NQ2K16,The pages are thick and sturdy and it does well with sharpies and charcoal pencils. I buy two at a time for my teenage son who is constantly drawing. One for at home and one for on the go.,5
B002NQ2K16,"This is a new version of the sketchpad and the only difference I can tell is the front and back covers are much thinner and less sturdy than the old version. The new version is not supportive enough for sketching with out using another hard surface underneath. When it comes time to get a new pad I will look for another brand with more sturdy covers. In pic above the old version is in front and the new in back, there is a noticeable difference.",4
B002NQ2K16,"After going through many spiral books at Michael's and Joann's, I came to the conclusion that this was the best sketchbook for junk journaling. It is thick enough for large amounts of glue and tape and I have never had a page accidentally start to rip. I recommend this to everyone I know who does junk journaling.",5
B002NQ2K16,this product I ordered for a college level art class.,3
B002NQ2K16,"My son had to have this for art class - a class he did not want to take. The book has held up really well, which is saying a lot for a middle school boy. I'm just glad I'm not having to rate his drawings he doesn't want to do, lol.",5
B002NQ2K16,"Thick paper, nice tear outs. Nice for all sorts of art mediums. Great size for storing my abnormal amount of deranged drawings  of waffles and chipmunks.  And of chipmunks eating waffles. And waffles eating chipmunks.  GREAT PRODUCT. WILL BUY AGAIN.",5
B002NQ2K16,"I am happy with this product. The thickness is suitable for markers, and the size makes them easy to carry.",5
B002NQ2K16,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought for my daughter she love it so much. She said good quality and good size Carrie , fit good in her package",5
B002NQ2K16,"Got this since I have a larger version and needed a smaller one to take around that was mixed media. Mainly using gouache and watercolour, the free edge will buckle a fair bit, but that's not too much of an issue for me, especially since I tape the sides down. With markers, it does bleed onto the back of the page, but not onto the next one, though it may with more layers (I tend to only use markers in 1 layer over sketches). Using microns and india ink, it doesn't seem to bleed through. Overall good sketchbook for travel. :)",4
B002NQ2K16,"Second time ever buying one of there sketchbooks and I love them so much! I got a 11 x 14 this time (first one I ever bought was 7 x 10) and it's pretty big! I wanted to draw bigger drawings so I decided to get a bigger one. I love all the different midias you can use on this sketchbook it's epic. I recommend this to any type of artist! I added a little doodle of Leo from rise of the tmnt because why not. Amazing product, will buy again! Also love the paper texture and thickness.",5
B002NQ2K16,This is perfect if you paint as much as I do. This way my house is not filled with canvases plus I'm saving money. I have to say some of my best works has been on this paper.,5
B002NQ2K16,"Been using the mixed media Canson sketchbooks for going on over 10 years give or take. Never had a complaint. paper is always good, easy to work with. Nice and thick. It is a very toothy paper on one side so if you do alot of work with charcoal and graphite, its going to blend and smudge easily. I Use Micron Pigma sensei pens, and they don't bleed through at all so that is a huge bonus.Im not one for brands but Canson has produced quality paper for a really cheap price for idk how long now, and while their prices have gone up because of the Recession, they are still fairly priced when compared to other products IMO",5
B002NQ2K16,Product arrived same as picture. Corners of the pages are bent slightly.,5
B002NQ2K16,"Since my local stores stopped selling these, and this kind is all I will use for my art due to the wonderful paper quality and durability of the book itself, I've had to order them online now. I hate not being able to buy them in person anymore but I'm sure to order them in advance before my prior book is full, I love the quality of these pages as they are thick and don't smear too much but also smear just the way I need them to when blending graphite. Overall out of all the brands I've tried over the years this brand has been my favorite, If you are a traditional artist looking for high quality paper that your pencil won't poke through and won't smear to all hell, this is your book! Only down fall is the spiral spine, after some use those spirals come undone and the book becomes hard to open and close properly.",5
B002NQ2K16,"I knew the size I was getting and that the paper  was gonna be a bit heavier since it was for mix media but this is great!The paper color is white, but not an obnoxious white.  The paper is smooth with very little tooth.  I can lay down graphite (Koh-i-noor 9B & Tombow 6B) and neither of those smeared easily when I ran my finger over it but was easily blendable with a stump.I also used Pigma Micron pens without any bleed through or feathering.  I was able to use both sides of the paper and not see through to the previous page. I tried a light water wash with color pencils. There was a little bit of rippling with the paper but it didn't go through to the other side. But that isn't my main medium so I may have been a bit heavy with the water.  Will have to work on that.I've got another Canson book, Artist Series, which I love, with a nice cream paper.  So didn't have a problem giving this one a try.  I'd  buy  it again.  It's a good size and the perforation section has enough room to leave a note about the page you removed or if you don't want the note on your actual work page.",5
B002NQ2K16,"I wanted a heavier weight, but this was as heavy as you had to offer.",4
B002NQ2K16,"Oops I bought this thinking it was regular canson xl mixed media paper but that is preferably 140lb paper. This paper is 90lb. If you are unfamiliar with what that means you should do a little bit of research because paper will matter in your work. 90lb is very thin and does not take water very well. I do not think that it should be called mixed media paper in my opinion. 140lb is your average ""watercolor"" paper which in my opinion is completely my fault because I didn't check the description. I will only take one star off though consider these flaws. This shouldnt be used with watercolor. I don't even really think you should use markers. (Unless they are super cheap) If you want this for crayons or colored pencils, be my guest. be my guestPut our service to the testTie your napkin 'round your neck, cherieAnd we'll provide the restSoup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvresWhy, we only live to serveTry the grey stuff, it's deliciousDon't believe me, ask the dishes.On that note.. have a great day and decide what you will on this paper.",4
B002NQ2K16,"There's a lot to love about the Canson XL series. When they say mix media, unlike others, they MEAN it. I've used pencil, pen, copics, charcoal, and watercolors in this sketchbook, and it's held up VERY well with all of these.As you can see in my attached pictures, you can draw in pencil, and there's minimal pencil transfer on facing pages.With watercolor, I will say that you DO get some warping of pages (still great for light washes/studies/tests), but I haven't experienced much bleed. (There is, sometimes, this funkiness as if the paper's refusing to accept the watercolor, but if you work it for a few seconds, it tends to take.) Also, the paper does start to break apart if it's too saturated with water, so I'd definitely stick to the light washes/studies/tests. Don't go too hardcore with wet media. (I know this seems a little critical, but I have had a lot of success using this sketchbook for wet media! You just shouldn't fuss with it too much.)With copics, you WILL get some bleed (see attached picture) but just slip a paper behind it the page you're drawing on.In general, the paper's really great. Thick, heavy, and durable. You can erase easily and without damaging the paper, and the binding holds up well.",5
B002NQ2K16,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It suits me well for what I needed, a notebook to do mixed techniques such as graphite, colored pencil and pen, although it is also seen that I can use watercolors, I will try it and I will come to give my opinion It suits me well for what I needed, a notebook to do mixed techniques such as graphite, colored pencil and pen, although it is also seen that I can use watercolors, I will try it and I will come to give my opinion.",5
B002NQ2K16,"This is my favorite sketchbook, especially for the price! I am left handed so I was worried that the wires would hurt my hand but I hardly notice the wires are there. I bring my sketchbook everywhere and I am very rough with it but it is still in good shape. The wires are kind of coming apart but that has nothing to do with the quality, it's just the fact that it's wirebound. I use many different medias in this sketchbook but I paint with watercolors in this all the time and it's really nice! There is a little buckling but that is expected. When the paper dries, it dries flat and that's all that matters to me since it's a /sketchbook/. I am really happy with how cheap it is because sometimes I'm scared to create in a sketchbook and ""waste"" pages with bad art. (Even though that's what sketchbooks are for) But I don't have a problem with this sketchbook since it's so cheap! I can be as creative as I want. This is a really high quality sketchbook and I recomment it to anyone!",5
B002NQ2K16,"I bought a set of sketch books here on Amazon a couple months before I purchased this. They were nice looking sketch books and they came in a pack of two for a good price. The paper, unfortunately, was very poor quality and every drawing ripped while I was working on it.This sketch book is more expensive for one than the two I received previously but the paper quality makes it so worth it. I opened up the booklet once I got it and spent a few moments basking in how good the quality was. The paper is sturdy, thick, and easily holds up to the abuse artists put it through. I've never had a piece of paper rip while drawing, erasing, or when I rip it out to put in my art folder.It doesn't matter if you're an art student, amateur doodler, or a serious professional. This sketch book will do what you need. I recommend it and honestly I can't wait to buy another one.",5
B000UU6SR4,"I remember the special occasion when I was younger and my mom was given a pair of what I believe were the equivalent of the 8"" dressmakers shears.  She was ecstatic and proceeded to use them with care for many years.  She still uses them today.  I recently got into sewing and thought there might be something better out there since technology was sure to develop over 15 years.  I was wrong, Gingher is still number one, and their classic style still dominates.  I purchased this 7"" pair and absolutely love them.  They come in a lovely red lined tin.  There is no leather sheath included with this model, so if that bothers you then I would recommend getting the 8"" dressmaker shears because they do come with a tin and the sheath.  Personally, this does not bother me because I don't have to worry about any little ones or pets hurting themselves.When you first open the tin, the shiny scissors scream quality. When you pick up the scissors, you instantly recognize that they are well balanced.  The center balance point is just in front of where your index finger goes in the lower blade. The weight is substantial but not burdensome at 1/4 pound exactly.  I like the 7"" size because I feel like I have good control over my cuts.  They are very sharp and, while I plan on purchasing a pair of Gingher 4"" embroidery scissors for the task, they are useful in nipping threads and cutting seams. These scissors had no problem cutting through multi-layer (sometimes 4-5 times thick!) duck canvas on a project I recently finished where I made reusable shopping bags.These scissors have marking under the ""Gingher"" logo stating that they are made in Italy.  It is my understanding that the blade sharpening takes place in South Carolina. The tin they come in is made in China.One other reviewer mentioned that they had issues with rust on their scissors.  I live in a fairly dry climate (Colorado Springs), so this is not an issue for me.  I can't help but wonder whether this reviewer lives in a very humid climate, or if the scissors are stored in an area that experiences a lot of moisture.  These scissors are not made of any materials different than other Gingher models, so you can rest assured you are getting the best quality.",5
B000UU6SR4,You cannot go wrong with the Gingher brand.Very well made and the price is reasonable for such good quality.They are very sharp and easy on the hands.They are good for crafts or sewing.,5
B000UU6SR4,"I'd never heard of these Cult-classic, original Gingher Stork ""embroidery"" scissors, until I became a new Mom, & rc'd as a gift from my very kind and wealthy Aunt.*Sidebar- My childhood memories are that my Aunt always had the finest of everything I'd never heard of:  Thick, soft, luxurious, decadent, sumptuous Egyptian cotton /European bed & bath linens, custom-made leather furniture, German Knives in Block, gorgeous artisan Stoneware tableware, commercial grade glasswear & German-made stainless steel drinking cups, + kitchen commercial grade, 2 ft- thick SOLID, butcher-block counter island (40 yrs. before it was commercially popularized), + industrial/commercial grade appliances, finest household goods (even soaps/shampoo's), European wardrobe, high-end, (never-heard-of European cosmetics, etc...) Plus, a frequent world-traveler w/ a maid/nanny & always-clean house (even with 3 young children- my cousins), etc.  Everything she owned was investment/lifetime- heirloom quality, German & European quality constructed.  She didn't buy a lot, but instead, only bought the best.*Back to reality- We are not wealthy :)  Now, 18 yrs. after my Aunt so wisely and thoughtfully gifted these Stork scissors to me upon becoming a new Mom, my ""baby"" is leaving for college next month.  As I sort through what we already have, & what we'll need to buy for her dorm-life (& beyond), I realize how indispensable these Gingher scissors are to us! :)  In retrospect, I suppose I've used them practically daily, to quickly precision snip something-or-other, for nearly 2 decades (& counting).  They're still as-new:  German engineered quality craftsmanship, combining Art & Function- w/ endless uses!My daughter was using them constantly too (still does!)- She'd ask permission to ""borrow"" them, made sure to return ""Mommy's good scissors"", but aometimes forgot where she so carefully ""remembered"" to return them <3  So, by the time she was 8 or 9 yrs. old, we agreed/ implemented the Stork scissors rule:  (Safety 1st- ALWAYS!).  She may use them without asking my permission 1st, & after each use, w/o being told to do so, they must be immediately returned to my top desk drawer.  (Mom follows same rule, lol!)  Being entrusted to use the fancy grown-up scissors without asking, was a huge source of pride for her!These little miracle scissors are one of the small comforts / conveniences of home... We'd be lost w/o them.  I've now purchased my daughter her own  pair, + back-ups for each of us.  I'd always just assumed that these were cost-prohibitive.  I tried buying an ""off brand"" for $6, w/o even bothering to see that these authentic Gingher's cost just $12!  Best $12 I've ever invested!  (They cost much more elsewhere- And I tossed the no-name brand).  Oh, btw- If you are wondering about the finger-hole size- They fit my daughter's slender, delicate fingers with room to spare, and my own fatter / larger fingers just fine, too.  (I've shattered my wrist & thumb, & broken all my fingers/knuckles, rollerblading & skiing- This means my fingers are no longer long, straight & slender, but rather, a bit bent, enlarged at the knuckle joints, and swollen in cold, wet weather).  No matter, these Stork Scissor's still fit perfectly.  If you are on the fence about whether to buy these, forget it- Buy them & stash in your office desk drawer or kitchen junk drawer nearby.Below is information & opinion copied from a sewing/cutlery specialty shoppe called The Silver Needle (Where these stork scissors are sold for $24-$58/each + S&H):""These are absolutely top quality German Solingen Steel scissors manufactured by Gingher.  The Solingen Region of Germany is an area world-renown for top quality cutlery.  All feature stainless steel cutting blades, and gold plating... just lovely! Excellent cutting action, smooth blades, with nice, sharp tips!  Gingher has a lifetime warranty on their products, covering the steel quality and design. They have a reconditioning service available in the US, approx $6.95, to recondition any of their scissors, if needed. It includes sharpening, tightening and lubrication... and I think that's a great bonus for the product!""Thx for reading this novel, buy, enjoy! :)",5
B000UU6SR4,Absolutely love these scissors! They are very comfortable in my hand and cut extremely nice. I do ALOT of sewing. Great price with extreme quality. You will not be disappointed!,5
B000UU6SR4,"These 7"" scissors are so nice I might leave them on the coffee table. They weight 4.8oz (137g), have a mirror finish, beautiful etching, and are like two razor sharp knives attached to each other. I have never had a pair of scissors/shears that I instantly loved when I held them.I was so frustrated with cheap scissors that had trouble cutting a single hanging thread (one that isn't taught). I've no doubt spent the same amount on multiple pairs that were basically garbage in comparison to these. These are something you pass on, you don't lose them or damage them because of their value, so they should last longer than me.I know the sheath is a big deal to many, and I'd love to have one to protect the finish, but these are such high quality that I'm not sure 5 stars is quite enough. Given that, I'll give them 6 stars, then I'll take one off for the sheath, leaving 5 stars. Maybe it's a guy thing, but I'm not petty enough to take off for that, even though I believe the seller should change the ad description. Still, there are things known as mistakes, and no one wants to be punished for one and I'm not going to do that to anyone else either. Had the sheath not been mentioned, I would have ordered them anyway and I actually forgot about it.",5
B000UU6SR4,"Gingher's sell Themselves; and This was a really good deal, Thank you!",5
B000UU6SR4,I read many reviews and decided that these 4 inch scissors were perfect for my needlework and sewing projects. You can feel and see the quality of these scissors. They are sharp and feel good in your hand. They do not feel flimsy and have a nice sharp edge and tip. I wish I had gotten these scissors years ago!,5
B000UU6SR4,"I've had Wiss 5"" scissors for 40 years and must have thrown them out during the holiday rush.  So sad to lose, but extremely happy to have this Gingher fabric scissors to replace them.  Perfect  feel and cut just like my old trusty ones.  I definitely recommend them if you're looking for this smaller size.",5
B000UU6SR4,Great cutting scissors,5
B000UU6SR4,"Sharp, good weight, good quality.",5
B000UU6SR4,This price is even better than Joann's with coupons. There is a reason ginghers have such a great reputation. Cuts through all kinds of fabric smooth like butter,5
B000UU6SR4,Have owned Gingher scissors for years. Can no longer find someone to sharpen my 40 year old scissors.  These are sharp and well made,5
B000UU6SR4,These are sharp and perfect for cutting out fabric. Make sure your family does not use them on anything else.,5
B000UU6SR4,"You can't find them in any fabric or notions store in my area. They are sharp, give a clean cut and better than described. I have an embroidery business and have been looking for these, just what I wanted!",5
B000UU6SR4,These are great. They are the high quality scissors I needed.,5
B000UU6SR4,"High quality, beautiful scissors delivered with the promised sheath.",5
B000UU6SR4,was bought for a Christmas for my wife she loves them,5
B000UU6SR4,I bought them for embroidery and they work perfectly! I'm able to cut very precisely.,5
B000UU6SR4,Gingers are the best sewing scissors. I must have 10 pair and often give them as gifts to other sewests,5
B000UU6SR4,Awesome scissors!! Great edge on them.,5
B000UU6SR4,"Love them, no complaints!",5
B000UU6SR4,Thumbs up!,4
B000UU6SR4,These are the best scissors!,5
B000UU6SR4,Cuts through all fabrics like a knife through melted butter.  Super easy on the hands.,5
B000UU6SR4,"This is my second pair. First pair was purchased in 1998 and would still be using those except they got lost in a move. Very sharp, first pair never needed sharpening. The size fits so nicely in my hand which is on the small side. Gingher is known for quality.",5
B000UU6SR4,These scissors are highly recommended by all of my seamstress/tailor contacts. I don't even have to close the blades to cut; all I have to do is slide a piece of fabric over a blade. Excellent quality! A great investment!`,5
B000UU6SR4,"I have always loved these scissors. Growing up, my mother and grandmother had these on hand. These cut very precise and still have their sharpness.",5
B000UU6SR4,"update 07/29/2013I have decided to keep these, I found someone to have them ""PROFESSIONALLY"" sharpened and they work great now.  I still think factory seconds though, so did the person who sharpened my scissors BUT, he said Gingher is one of the best made out there, so I have also bought dressers shears and a pair of serrated for silks and fine fabrics.  Will review when I get them.  He also could not believe that I only paid $18 for these as they are over $100 in sewing stores, if they even carry them, but can special order. I paid $25 for the sharpening!!  LOLI will say that the actual metal is of high caliber as is the mold, each scissor side is one piece, which is important.  You can also adjust the tension by the bolt.  Also, many complain about the fabric not cutting properly and you will see this issue on ALL reviews for ALL pinking shears, you need to hold the fabric correctly and adjust the scissors if using heavy weight and really light such as bulky Denim to light organza.  Pinking shears have never been easy to use but I can say that these will and should last a lifetime.Still, I would not pay over around $20 for these scissors, if I want the top I would do more research and try to find them at the best price.  I have bought three of these, the pinking shears, dressmakers shears and serrated edge for fine fabrics such as satin and silks.  It looks like ""KAI"" might be the top scissors as far as qauality that I can find with quick research, but a lot more money.________________UPDATE 07/10/2013This is an ok product and I am taking it down from 4 stars to 3 stars.  I think this is a factory reject because it DOES NOT cut fabric if you put it all thway up to handle area.  You have to keep the fabric at the 1/2 way or 3/4 way mark on the scissor blades.  I will complain and see if I can get a refund with shipping as shipping them will cost quite a bit as they are very heavy.  Not that happy with the purchase, I would suggest buying either another brand or this brand but a different style.  Very bummed out.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Good Quality but REALLY heavy so giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, and I mean really, really heavy.  BUT, it is constructed well and is of very high quality.  You ALWAYS want to buy metal scissors that are forged as one piece for each blade.  When you buy ones that have the blades fitted into plastic handles they are usually of cheaper material and should cost A LOT less as the cost to produce is cut in half for materials.  The same thing with knives, the kind you use to cook with, you want to see one solid piece of metal from tip to end and a handle wrapped around it. Like Hinkle knives.You also need to start cutting at the beginning of the fabric as it tends to fold it otherwise, as you cut.  If it keeps doing that I will update the review and send it back.The only thing I would recommend to the manufacturer is to lighten up in the handles, it will be more manageable, especially those with arthritis in their hands like me.BUT, ""Gingher"" is QUALITY, and at the price that I bought them I am thrilled.  I just hope they are not at a discount because of flaws while being produced.  Only time will tell.",5
B000UU6SR4,"Very high build quality, super sharp, cut through fabric like nothing. Really enjoy using it.",5
B000UU6SR4,These are the best clippers I've ever used in my 59 years of sewing.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the price.,5
B000UU6SR4,These are really good scissors. They cut clean and sharp and have a good heavy weight to them. Recommended if you like to cut your own fabric.,5
B000UU6SR4,I bought these to cut jeans and these are super great quality. Very sturdy. Feels like I got them from a seamstress.,5
B000UU6SR4,Fit well in my hand. Perfect cuts. Length is accurate and easy to maneuver. Well-designed and functional as fabric shears.,5
B000UU6SR4,WOULD SUREL RECOMMEND.,5
B000UU6SR4,I have two pairs of these scissors.I do lots of sewing.knife sharp so pay attention.,5
B000UU6SR4,Very sharp scissors for cutting yarn. Holding a little difficult as size is so small.,4
B000UU6SR4,These are the sharpest sewing scissors I have ever had. Best quality and well worth the money. Keep them away from people who would use them for cutting anything other than fabric.,5
B000UU6SR4,Sewing,5
B000UU6SR4,"I ordered the 8"" silver dressmaker shears.  I've been a hobby seamstress for 60+ years.  I have never before seen scissors so sharp and easy to use!  They are better than a dressmaker's dream come true!",5
B000UU6SR4,I use the scissors for so many things. Removing dress tags. Cutting tags off of clothing.  Cutting long threads from jeans after washing. Jeans that I have cut and made fringe so sometimes long threads come lose during wash. Cleaning hairs from my nose. Many other things I can't think of right now.,5
B000UU6SR4,"I've been using Gingher since the 1970s when my mother gave me hers.  She got that pair in the late 1940s.In the mid 1980s, my husband gave me a set of two.  They've been sharpened a lot over the years and after this last sharpening, the knife guy said he didn't know how many more times he could do it.  They were getting thin.  SO, I ordered this 7 inch pair and an 8 inch pair.  Both said they came with a protective sheath.  The 8 inch pair did.  The 7 inch pair did not.  Amazon sent a replacement pair and it still doesn't have on.So, BUYER BEWARE on this.  If you need the sheath, you won't get it here. (I can't use the sheath from my old pair because it's 8 inches, not the 7 inches)And, don't bother trying to get in touch with Fiskars.  Everything is automated, no phone calls, no email that tells you a real person is there.  I've been trying to deal with them since I got the shears.  You are better off getting them at a store.",4
B000UU6SR4,"These are high quality, super sharp and get the job done.",5
B000UU6SR4,Excellent quality item will last for long time cuts perfectly straight and smooth,5
B000UU6SR4,"I compared the following fabric shears, listed in order of how well I liked them:1. The  Kai 7250: 10 inch Professional Shears N7250 (7250) - Professional Shears        2. The  Gingher 10 Inch Knife Edge Bent Trimmers        (Note: I list these here because I prefer this length, but I only tested the 8"" and 12"" models below.)3. The  Kai 7300: 12 inch Professional Shears N7300 (7300) - Professional Shears        4. The  Gingher Knife Edge Bent Trimmers 12        5. The  Gingher G-8T KE Tailors Shears, 8-Inch        6. The  Gingher G-8 8-Inch Knife-Edge Dressmaker's Shears        7. The ""Kai 110: 11 inch Tailoring Shears S-110 (S-110) - Professional Shears""8. The ""Kai 7240-AS: 10 inch Serrated Edge Shears N7240-AS (7240-AS) - Professional Shears""I bought all the Ginghers on Amazon, and all the Kais from their web site (Amazon doesn't sell them). I evaluated them by cutting eight 4"" long layered sheets of lightweight cotton fabric at once. My criteria were:- smoothness of cutting- was the edge straight, or did it wave?- comfort of scissors (hand position, weight, tightness of grip)- how often did I have to open the scissors to cut the 4"" fabric?With all 8"" shears I had to open them too often, resulting in more effort needed to get a straight cut. With all 12"" shears I had to open them too wide, which was difficult even with my very large (size 10+) hands. I thus settled on a 10"" pair.The Ginghers are all excellent -- better than any of those colored-handle shears I've tried. They are rumored to last 25 years, and they're not that expensive ($25). Of those, the tailoring shears were ever-so-slightly smoother than the dressmaker shears. Not sure why.But the Kai 7000 series were simply better. They're smoother, lighter-weight, sharper, nicer engineering, and they offer a $14 sharpening service. Wow. Them's be some sharp scissors. Holy cow. Did the ""let's gently run my thumb perpedicular to this blade"" test and a minute later realized I was bleeding... Didn't even feel it. Must also say the customer service was top-notch. They sent me the 3 pair I wanted to test in advance, and didn't charge my card till I picked the one I liked best.Yes, they're $70. But Gingher's 10"" pair are $50, too. If you're looking for the best bang for your buck, I'd get the ""Gingher G-8T KE Tailors Shears, 8-Inch"" ($25). If you're looking for the best fabric shears period, I'd get the Kai 7000 series (the 10"" ones for me).Update (01/09/2013): A fellow reviewer pointed out to me that Amazon now carries some of the Kai shears. I have added links above to those they carry at this time. And I still recommend looking at the manufacturer's web site. They offered me super service -- really above and beyond.",5
B000UU6SR4,"If you're at all serious about fabric work why would you buy anything else? Note these have to be professionally sharpened, although they should never need it if you only use them for fabric. These are the best scissors I've ever used.",5
B000UU6SR4,"Finally have really good fabric scissors. I keep them hidden. This is something that will last a long time, with proper care. And hiding.",5
B000UU6SR4,It did not come with the leather protective sheath.,3
B000UU6SR4,these scissors are incredibly sharp and durable.  they work amazing for leather working.  I cant wait to pick up a left handed pair as well for some of those weirder cuts!,5
B000UU6SR4,"My fave pair of scissors for all my craft work, also love they come with a cover. Heavy in the hand but not too heavy, sharp, easy to control, high quality, would purchase again. Lasting several years of very light use, but still impressed.",5
B000UU6SR4,"Love 'em. Bought one for me, but then bought one for my wife. I sew. She crafts. Love the professional quality of Gingher. Hasn't changed since the first pair I bought my first wife (a seamstress) back in 1984.My wife wasn't crazy that I bought her something I bought for my first wife. Tell you what, minute she used them, she got over it. :)",5
B000UU6SR4,"Super sharp, small, quality snips.  Great design.  Super easy to use.  Very useful around sewing machines.  What's not to like about it.716kauai",5
B000UU6SR4,Just the right weight and size for a new sewing enthusiast,5
B000UU6SR4,"These scissors are great for cutting out pattern pieces.  They are long enough but not too long, and are very sharp and easy to handle.  I do recommend them.",5
B000UU6SR4,Money well spent.,5
B000UU6SR4,"Genuinely sharp, qaulity product.",5
B000UU6SR4,"I'm going to use this opportunity to praise all of the Gingher product in my selection of notions and tools:Pinking Shears ***** I was tired of fighting with the plastic-handled cheapies that I learned I couldn't get resharpened and got a couple pair of these. They're sturdier and easier to use than the cheapies and give great results.Knife Edge 8"" Shears***** After using my friend's while sewing at their home, I knew I'd found the ""good"" pair of fabric scissors I needed. These stay sharp, don't feel too big in my hand, and I can use them with my left hand as well, which is always a huge win in my book.Knife Edge 5"" Sewing Scissors***** I work on a lot of doll clothes so having a smaller pair of excellent shears makes cutting out those patterns much easier.Gingher Epaulette 3.5""**** The cutting surface on these is fantastic. The only reason these get a 4/5 stars is b/c I do find it hard to get my fingers out of the holes due to the way they're shaped.One of the best parts about owning these is sending them back to the factory when they need sharpened is pretty simple, especially for the pinking shears.",5
B000UU6SR4,Love how well they cut fabric. Great choice.,5
B000UU6SR4,Cuts perfect! Love them!,5
B000UU6SR4,"These little nippers are great, once you get the hang of them! I read the instructions on how they're supposed to be held, but when I followed those instructions, my hand ended up as an awkward bouquet of fingers haphazardly draped on this tool in a way that borders on immovable. So I gave up on the directions and have found a way that works really well for me. Prepare to do the same. Try some different hand positions and eventually one of them will feel right and give you the control you need.They are incredibly sharp, and good for getting into some tight spaces. I use them for a variety of situations: sometimes I need them to cut through a thread nest, I've used them to cut through thread on a bobbin that had been partially wound incorrectly, and I have used them in place of my default seam ripper (which is the primary reason I bought them). They are very sharp and far more effective than the sad little seam ripper that comes with most sewing machines. However, I also purchased the  Crafters Helper Ultra Pro II Seam Ripper and Buttonhole Cutter        around the same time as these nippers and feel that as a seam ripper, it is even more effective than these Gingher Thread Nippers. The Crafters Helper Ripper is smaller and a little sharper so it can fit into even tighter spaces, and I can cut through threads with even the lightest touch with  it. So, if you're solely looking for a seam ripper replacement, that's the tool I'd recommend. However, if you're looking for a tool that can do some of the duties of a seam ripper and some of the duties of a pair of embroidery scissors, this is a great tool. I'm very happy with it's performance and use it often.One issue I had was that the little piece it comes with to keep the blades closed when not in use is very tiny, plastic, and looks like garbage. I lost it my first time using these nippers. I'm pretty sure I accidentally picked it up with my scraps and tossed it. It's very likely that you will too. However, I've found that the blade tips fit great in a 3 1/2"" Gingher Leather Sheath, which I found on Etsy for ~$3. It's the same leather sheath that comes standard with Gingher Embroidery Scissors. I really wish Gingher would just package these nippers with that same sheath instead of the tiny piece of plastic garbage, but it was easy enough to obtain one.Overall, I think this is a good tool. It's sharp, sturdy, has a nice weight to it, and has flexible functionality.",4
B000UU6SR4,Me encantaron de muy buena calidad,5
B000UU6SR4,"Having a great pair of scissors for small sewing / craft jobs is a dream. Love these.  Very precise. Came with a hard plastic blade protector. Live them: Grip, cut, weight and quality. I am sure these will last a lifetime.",5
B000UU6SR4,As always Gingher is quality!,5
B000UU6SR4,they seem to stick when cutting not a smooth cut  maybe I'm just use to my hairstyling shears.,3
B000UU6SR4,These are very sharp and seem well made. Very happy so far.,5
B000UU6SR4,Very sharp High quality made of excellent materials tailor scissors,5
B000UU6SR4,"Cutting thread and fabric is accurate and easy using these 5"" lightweight sewing scissors. No need for heavy, large scissors on the sewing table.",5
B000UU6SR4,"I like this scissors, they are very sharp, I have use them very little but,I like them, they cut well, is a good product, and the price was very good, is a good product, and a good brand.",5
B000UU6SR4,Quality quality quality! Watched my grandmother use these scissors growing up and still to this day they are the best!,5
B000UU6SR4,I love my stork scissors,5
B000UU6SR4,Gingher speaks for itself. Can't go wrong here.,5
B000UU6SR4,These Scissors are very sharp all the way to the tip.,5
B000UU6SR4,"These scissors are very nice, the operation and cutting are very nice, and worth the cost.",5
B000UU6SR4,I love these quality scissors. So Sharp and precise!,5
B000UU6SR4,These scissors came with one of my embroidery machines that I purchased several years ago.  They are the absolute best scissors for embroidery and applique.  I use them daily.  I just purchased this pair to have an extra.  The curved handle makes it perfect for cutting any loose threads.,5
B000UU6SR4,"These Gingher Scissors are sharp and easy to use. Not too heavy or bulky, feels good in your hand.  Good quality too.",5
B000UU6SR4,Gets the job done well. Cuts through fabric like butter! Very durable and I am pleased it came with a protective cover while not in use.,5
B000UU6SR4,These little scissors make a great addition to any sewing project!,5
B000YZASYO,Great versatility.Looks great  quality was great cutting ability and functionality is great. It was a good thickness and is a very good protection for table top.,5
B000YZASYO,"This is a great mat.  Love the fact that it is double sided and the size fits my needs.  Finally had to ""retire"" my old mat due to the cuts, but had it for about 6 years.  It was also a Fiskers double sided, self healing mat, so I bought another one just like it.  Hopefully, this one will last that long.  Good price for a good product.",5
B000YZASYO,Great mat ! Measurements are correct and work well !,5
B000YZASYO,I looked at a lot of products and their reviews and I'm glad I chose this brand.  While it is not as large as I wanted I found it to be excellent quality in terms of self-healing. So far I have only used it on sheer cotton material so I cannot say how it would work with thinker fabric. But for my project (a Regency ball gown pattern) it was a time saver.  I especially like the clean cuts compared to using scissors and the need for less pinning. It gives the raw edges a pretty good finish.,5
B000YZASYO,Works as stated. Great mat. Highly recommended. Used it as a surface to wrap presents,5
B000YZASYO,"I had picked this up with the intention of manually cutting acrylic sheets for display cases, and figured I would like this on the surface under the sheets to help protect them, and give me an easy to see grid underneath to help along with the T-squares I also purchased.Now having done some of the initial work, I realized I'm not going to spend all my time scribing cuts in the sheets to snap them by hand.  Too much work for the sizes I was working with, too easy to go off even with the T-square to line the cutter against, so now I'm waiting for my table saw to deliver.  This won't be used nearly as much now, but I may keep it for my Lego table just as a good surface to work off of.",4
B000YZASYO,I learned the hard way that you need to have a SOLID surface to cut on. (Ask me about my scratched up dining room table!) This mat is indestructible and very well made. Super helpful for quilting/sewing or any craft where you need a nice big surface to measure things and cut. It's a major upgrade to your crafting hobbies.,5
B000YZASYO,Great mat for a great price.  Needed to replace mine that was getting old.  This did the trick,5
B000YZASYO,Upgraded to get a larger mat and this did the trick. Fits on my folding table in my sewing room that I use for cutting fabrics on fairly frequent basis.,5
B000YZASYO,Been needing this for long long hope it lasts long love the size of it.,5
B000YZASYO,Good mat for cutting with markings. Very easy to use.,5
B000YZASYO,"although it took longer than expected to come in, this is EXACTLY what i needed for a crafting cutting board !! affordable price too !",5
B000YZASYO,"I've been working on assembling and working to get a longarm running. It takes a lot of space, so not enough room for a cutting station. My solution was to get a thin plywood, adhered pressing fabric to one side and a cutting mat to the other. I haven't adhered this, but it fit perfectly, does well with cutting fabric and weight is perfect for my application.",5
B000YZASYO,"75% the quality of an Olfa, at half the price.  I enjoy the lavender color.",4
B000YZASYO,Great size and quality item for the price.  Great value.  Shipped flat and fast.,5
B000YZASYO,"Love this, very useful",5
B000YZASYO,Bigger than imagined. But it covers good portion of our table. Haven't tested self healing. But not planning to run a blade for that. Do need to cut some linoleum for some linocut. Hope I don't have to test the self healing. It would make good cover for the working area for all the hobbies.,5
B000YZASYO,Easier to see than the green mat,5
B000YZASYO,"I love this mat, finally found one where I can cut out my deco mesh to just about any length I need. The lilac color is a big plus!",5
B000YZASYO,"I like it a lot, when working on projects to keep the table scratch free. It works as intended and the self healing is pretty neat too.",5
B000YZASYO,Substantial enough to last for a long time even with regular use. Well priced from a trusted manufacturer.,5
B000YZASYO,Love my cutting mat. Finally a size I can work with and love the size. Highly recommend.,5
B000YZASYO,"Works well, a bit hard to store though",5
B000YZASYO,"This is the same as the mat I have been using for years, but this one fits on my workstation!",5
B000YZASYO,It is great. Was cheaper than getting it from a craft store,5
B000YZASYO,"I bought this during black Friday and got 50% off it. This was probably my best buy of the year!It is perfect size, thickness, and great quality.",5
B000YZASYO,it works. see photos for usage after a week. Backside is still good as new so I can use it when this side gets all messed up :3,5
B000YZASYO,Product is exactly as stated,5
B000YZASYO,soo goodquality,5
B000YZASYO,Very good and durable,5
B000YZASYO,"Although I have not used it much, I like it.  I think it has been the worth the money.",4
B000YZASYO,"Good size, markings and healing ability for the home tinker in your family. Protects our floors and furniture from my hobbyist son.",5
B000YZASYO,Worked as expected,5
B000YZASYO,TODO OK,5
B000YZASYO,Keeps my work bench protected and neat. Double sided so you can just use one side for cutting on. The markings help with a quick glance of your degree angles when cutting or laying out a new project.,5
B000YZASYO,"BOught for use with leatherworking. Soon found it to be the ideal non-marring work top for almost anything from small engine/motorcycle restoration, to adult leather product design, to electronics repair, to gunsmithing. Need to order a few more.",5
B000YZASYO,This product arrived with shoe prints it. I can understand if a product arrives with dust from manufacturing but shoe marks? Otherwise I was satisfied.,4
B000YZASYO,"This is a high quality cutting mat! It'snice and thick, the details are easy to see, easy to cut on, and it's two sided. I do a lot of quilting and need a large surface to work with. I decided to secure the mat to my folding table and ordered a second mat for the other side of the table. It will give me a 36 x 24 area to work with and cut on. I'm very pleased with this mat.",5
B000YZASYO,I sent this to my daughter as a gift. She loved it when she opened it.,5
B000YZASYO,Nice mat but has an odor.,3
B000YZASYO,"Of late any brand self healing cutting surface I buy has a very off putting smell, this is no exception. I hope it goes away soon, my Olfa mat of many years never did. Kind of interferes with the joy of sewing.",4
B000YZASYO,"Overall I'm happy with this - it does the job. It isn't as ""squishy""/self-healing as some other brands I've owned in the past, but those cost more. This was an office purchase so I didn't want to break their bank for something that is not used daily. I would recommend it and buy it again.",4
B000YZASYO,"This product works great but have not been able to get rid of the toxic chemical smell.  It has been airing out in the garage, has been washed vigorously with Dawn detergent and still can't get rid of toxic smell.  Otherwise would have given 5 stars.",3
B000YZASYO,"when this item first arrived it had a strong stank to it. I had no idea what to do, I couldn't bear this mat in my room. I could smell it from 10 feet away. desperate I went to the amazon reviews if others experienced this same stinky odor. it was pretty common apparently. others suggested it to leave it out or sanitize it. I left it out in the backyard for 2 days, the smell was still there but not as strong. I left it out for another 2 days and it seemed to do the trick. this is def a good versatile mat, but please air out or else your room will be stanking bad",4
B000YZASYO,"I decided to get this larger size cutting mat and glad I did.  It is such a great size to use on the dining room table (if you don't have a special cutting table for this).  It is self-healing, but you have to do your part.  I clean mine every time I use it.  It just takes a second.  I use a damp sponge and a dry cotton wash cloth or small towel to rub across those areas where I just cut.  You can feel it with your fingers where you need to rub the sponge and then the towel.  I kept the box it came in and keep it stored flat under the couch, it's out of the way but available when I need it.  Please don't store it leaning against the wall, it will warp. It's just amazing all the products available to make your sewing projects a breeze!!!",5
B000YZASYO,My wife being a quilt maker swears by this mat,5
B000YZASYO,"I have been looking for a mat in a bigger size that the standard, and with a graphic a bit more fun than the usual blue or green with a ruler on. This mat checks all the boxes: beautiful graphic, bigger size, nice quality material, and great price point! Super recommended!",5
B000YZASYO,"I've been using this for a few months. It's pretty and functional. The challenge is that I use it sometimes as a placement (not moving it when I eat at the table). It warped the first time I put a warm (NOT HOT) bowl of soup on it. If your crafts or use of this mat includes any heat, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",3
B000YZASYO,great for cutting out quilting pieces,5
B000YZASYO,This cutting mat works great as an entry level. It's not like the best I've ever had or used it's kind of a little hard but it works just fine for entry level for beginners. If you don't want to invest and break the bank. This is a great cutting mat.,5
B000YZASYO,Good size. Works well for what I need it for,5
B000YZASYO,"After I moved I needed to buy a cutting mat. I knew that I wanted a mat that is great quality. Fiskars self healing cutting mats have always been on top of my preferred list. Self healing helps prolong the life of your cutting mat. So, I'm back to quilting and will be using it for a very long time.",5
B000YZASYO,Good,4
B000YZASYO,"No suprises on quality or anything, exactly what you see is what you get",5
B000YZASYO,"I wasn't exactly sure if I was getting anything better quality than the more off brand versions. But I have to say this is every bit as nice as what you'd find in a school or art/craft place. I love this matIt's extremely useful for 3d Printing and scanning/taking images of things to reproduce. Also it's pretty thick, so I think it'll hold up to my shop environment",5
B000YZASYO,Had many kitchen cabinet drawers to line and this made that project a breeze.,5
B000YZASYO,Having hard time keeping it flat. Rolled up too long,3
B000YZASYO,Really cute and self healing. Love the size of this mat.,5
B000YZASYO,Items were in a large box that I brought into the house. I wasn't sure where the smell came from but it was the box. Had a STRONG weed smell. Got a headache from it. Sending back an excellent product because of this!,4
B000YZASYO,"Love it right size to do youe art ,  ect ...........love it love it , love it yes",5
B000YZASYO,I needed a new cutting mat and this works perfect.,5
B000YZASYO,Bought this for a work surface on my desk. Product arrived fast in a large box not rolled or folded. Just hoping my wife don't steal it,5
B000YZASYO,Very useful in keeping the measurements equality,5
B000YZASYO,"This cutting mat is amazing and I cannot recommend it enough. It has a good thickness and has a semi self-healing property to it so that there are not huge gouges in it. It also has two different colored sides to make it easier to use with different colored fabrics. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys sewing or any crafting projects as it provides an excellent surface for cutting fabric, paper, and other materials!",5
B000YZASYO,Fast shipping. Great product. Thank you.,5
B000YZASYO,"This is a nice cutting board, but I have an old fiskars one that I can tell was a better quality.",4
B000YZASYO,I like the size but it's not as self healing as my smaller mat. I do have cut marks left behind from use.,4
B000YZASYO,"I hope the odor goes away.  It's really awful.  Almost skunk like.Update, the smell is hardly noticeable now.  Very happy with product.",4
B000YZASYO,These mats provide excellent protection to your table top and the measuring grid is very useful.,5
B000YZASYO,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love the color and it is a great quality.,5
B000YZASYO,These mats really smell bad like burnt rubber. No better after 3 weeks,4
B000YZASYO,"The size is great! Perfect thickness, covers 1/2 my table!! Now I don't have to move it around to cut large pieces!",5
B000YZASYO,Great price and quality.  If I purchase this item at craft stores it is 3x the price I paid online.,5
B000YZASYO,Nice size and cost effective,5
B000YZASYO,Works just as described.  Sav3s my table from getting cuts.,5
B000YZASYO,I bought this to cut t-shirts and other crafts.  Works very well.  It does whaymt its supposed to do.  Very pleased,5
B000YZASYO,"The lilac color is very attractive and there's not much else to say, this is probably the best brand you could buy for cutting mats and accessories. The mat is sturdy, stays in place and has useful measurements. The other side is light gray and also looks nice.",5
B000YZASYO,"I've have several cutting boards and one well known brand cracked after a few years.  This board is actually 24"" x 36"" with a boarder and the dimensions are inside the boarder.",5
B000YZASYO,I bought this for less than half the cost of what I would've paid at Joann's and got fun colors too.,5
B000YZASYO,"Can't say enough about the beautiful scene on the opposite side of the Woodlands version of this cutting mat. If you leave your cutting mat out like I do, you just got used to this ugly mat facing the world. (I hate the neon gross green color that most cutting mats have. Who has that color in their home?) This has a beautiful mountain scene on the other side, which is nice to look at every day. On the flip side, the color scheme is still green, and the numbers of the inches are BIG and easy to see. I am very glad I bought this and  say WAY TO GO to Fiskars on this.",5
B000YZASYO,Needed larger version on the smaller mat I had for cutting larger projects- works good.,4
B000YZASYO,Fabric stores have these at a ridiculous price. So glad I found it on Amazon!,5
B000YZASYO,"I adore my new two color, two sided Fiskars mat.  Fun colors and great design.  I have not cut on it yet.",5
B000YZASYO,"(36x24 version).  The mat itself seems fine.  When I ordered, I was a little concerned that it might arrive rolled up or something but it arrived flat in a big box.  What little odor there was dissipated in about a day.Neither side is particularly grippy, though, so it slides across my desk if I apply too much horizontal pressure (such as pushing myself away from my desk).  I suppose that's the disadvantage of a double-sided cutting mat.  I might invest in some double-sided carpet tape to see if that'll hold it in place.",4
B000YZASYO,This is very user friendly and durable.,5
B000YZASYO,Not self healing for long. I have cuts in the mat along with the fabric fibers that is stuck in the cuts.,3
B000YZASYO,I used with my craft knives and the surface scratched easily.,3
B000YZASYO,I have had other brands but this seems to be much better made and having 2 sides of different colors and design are another perk.,5
B001B1YTWW,These work great. So far the adhesive has held good for what I have needed.  Seem very durable.,5
B001B1YTWW,We used these to affix small thank you print outs to cookies for favors and it worked perfectly. They held in place well while still being pliable enough to remove to fix if it was put on crooked. This had enough strength to hold fairy lights onto  centerpieces as well. The dispensers are a must for faster application. We had over 200 cookies to label and 20 centerpieces to set up and we could get it done in about an hour.,5
B001B1YTWW,"Even thou it sticks stuff you need, it is very easy to totally remove without damaging the surface of either the object or the place you are flying it too. Fast, fair hold and the rolling device works well to apply.",5
B001B1YTWW,"We purchased these for a marketing promotion in retail stores. Employees sell a gift card and instead of sliding them into the usual sleeves, they affix a glue dot using the handy dispenser and press the gift card on top. The customer walks out with a beautiful paper card including the gift card, makes for so much better presentation.The glue dots work just perfect, they are thin, but keep the card securely in place. The dispenser feels good in the hand and after applying a few dots it's easy to figure out how not to dispense too many at the same time as they're spaced rather closely together.We have not tried mailing a card without an envelope and a plastic gift card affixed with a glue dot, so I can not speak if it would work in this scenario. But from handling it I would say a 12 mil plastic card would probably have less of a chance to get ripped off.",4
B001B1YTWW,"After installing Nespresso pod holders to the side of my refrigerator (pod holders came with mounted double sided tape to adhere to ""any"" surface). Within 2 days, half of the 8 pod holders had failed. I purchased these Glue Dots to attach directly to the double sided tape and then reinstall the pod holders. Not only did that work much better than that supplied with the Pod Holder product, they provide a very thin additional clearance that improved the use of the pod holders in adding and removing the pods. Great product for this type of usage!",5
B001B1YTWW,"The only aspect of this product that I liked was the advertising.  Unfortunately, these ""dots"" were abysmal failures when using them to 'stand' O-gauge model RR figures.There was no way I could apply them as ""dots"" to the areas requiring adhesive; more like ""blobs.""Once 'standing' the figures soon began to lean and ultimtely lie flat.  Applying additional ""blobs"" made no difference at all.I do not recommend these to those in the model RR hobby.",1
B001B1YTWW,More than one glue dot comes off at one pass. I wasted more than I used. Stick to the glue dot sheets.,3
B001B1YTWW,These glue dots are the best! I really appreciate handy dispenser which is so easy to use.,5
B001B1YTWW,I use these to help in printing polymer plates in an inkjet printer. They are of great value! and - inexpensive. why not!,5
B001B1YTWW,"These glue dots are easy to remove, but they only held up for super light items.",4
B001B1YTWW,Doesn't hold up long but is great for crap,4
B001B1YTWW,They are great. I just wished that they could have come faster. The shipping was forever.,4
B001B1YTWW,My granddaughters love these for their crafts.  The quality is good.  I think we will be buying more of these in the future.,5
B001B1YTWW,"Bought these because someone had a hissy fit about me using push pins to hold items on the wall of my exam room; they have been holding documents on my walls there for over two years.  Good job.  Yes, I would buy these again.",4
B001B1YTWW,LOVE THIS DISPENSER!,4
B001B1YTWW,These are the absolute best!,5
B001B1YTWW,"I purchased dots so I could safely attach pictures without damaging them, to poster board.  I purchase 2, and was pleased with the outcome.  The pictures stayed secure and when I went to remove them the adhesive easily rolled off without ruining the pictures or tearing at the back.  I was especially happy since some of the pictures were from the 40's and were delicate.",4
B001B1YTWW,"As a removable Dot I work wonders, when packaging a gift or doing some scrap book work. Something you will appreciate having it near by.",4
B001B1YTWW,"The Glue Dots Dot N' Go Dispenser has become an indispensable tool in my crafting arsenal! With its double-sided adhesive dots, I can tackle a wide range of DIY projects with ease. The dispenser design makes application a breeze - simply press and stick for instant adhesion. I love how versatile these glue dots are - perfect for adhering paper, fabric, wood, and more without any mess or fuss. Plus, the removable feature allows for easy repositioning or adjustment of materials during the crafting process. With 200 dots in a convenient dispenser, I have more than enough adhesive for my various projects. If you're a DIY enthusiast looking for a reliable and mess-free adhesive solution, look no further than Glue Dots Dot N' Go Dispenser!",5
B001B1YTWW,Always good to have on hand!,5
B001B1YTWW,Used it to glue some paper wings on Ferraro chocolates to make them look like Golden Snitch (Harry Potter). I also used it to glue paper decorations on my arch. I was surprised it stick to the cloth and held up all day,5
B001B1YTWW,I was so happy to stumble upon this product randomly. It is great to have on hand for miscellaneous projects. They work really well and will for sure buy them again when this runs out.,5
B001B1YTWW,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I loved this product and it was working exceptionally well on the poster board we were creating. However, it only came with about a dozen or so dots. The rest of the tape was empty- no adhesive dots. I was very disappointed and am hoping this is just an isolated issue as I would love to use these again on various projects.",2
B001B1YTWW,"I was trying to attach stickers to the back of my kindle scribe without actually using the stickers. (Long story involving childhood anxiety and stickers.) These glue dots allow me to keep the backing on my precious book stickers while still getting them to sit in place. I never knew this product existed until I was searching up rubber cement and other crafting glues. This fits the hill, as I can remove and change up my stickers ( I have so many stickers and so little room, even on my large Kindle Scribe,) without ruining anything.",5
B001B1YTWW,I bought these to hang wire fairy lights to wooden trees.  More than one dot came off at a time and rolled over each other into a gummy ball.  Would not stick to the wood.  So disappointed.,2
B001B1YTWW,"These dots are available as removable and permanent versions.  Also, the 3/8"" refers to the width of the dot, not the thickness.",5
B001B1YTWW,Our invitations sleeve needed something to keep the paper in place. These are removable and makes adjustments so easy!,5
B001B1YTWW,Good on Walls,5
B001B1YTWW,"5 stars for it's adhesion, quality, and thickness, and use however on the value for your $$ the dots are now  ridiculously low.",3
B001B1YTWW,Putting photos and other items onto a canvas.,4
B001B1YTWW,This product is very good and works well.,5
B001B1YTWW,"Very happy with these Glue Dots!  This removable style works great and the dispenser is neat and convenient.  Application is effortless and when needed, the flip away cap can be used to access the dots manually.",5
B001B1YTWW,"I was excited to purchase this product.  I wish to mount some vintage ephemera without damaging them.  These dots are so tiny and non-substantial.  By the time you peel them off the dispenser they have lost their stickiness and are misshapen.  Excellent idea, but poor quality.",2
B001B1YTWW,"The Removable Dot N' Go Glue Dots Dispenser was a good purchase.  You receive 200 glue dots.  They measure approximately 3/8"" each in diameter.  Glue Dots are wonderful to use.  They make attaching photos and things a lot easier and more professional than using tape or glue than can damage your photo or item if you try to remove it.  I definitely recommend using Glue Dots.  Glue dots work on the back of photos, on paper, on metal, on glass and more I'm sure.The dispenser can be problematic, and it sometimes is a little difficult to dispense with the roller.  You have to watch what you roll out so you don; roll out more than one.  But once you have the Glue Dot applied, all is good.Other than the roller with the Glue Dots really close together, I had no issues with the dispenser.  Glue Dots are easy to use, and they make life a lot easier with no mess to clean up.  And, it is easy to remove to preserve your item or to apply elsewhere.I recommend Glue Dots.  You can get them in various sizes and quantities, and they are available on Amazon.  If you have Amazon Prime, the 2-day Free shipping on your orders is very nice.",5
B001B1YTWW,Super easy to use.,5
B001B1YTWW,Excellent adhesion. It's pretty difficult to remove anything stuck by these but it's possible. I use them for attaching small parts to a card that I ship in the mail. The only drawback is that it's a little hard to place them. I accidentally place two of them down pretty often. I wish the dispenser was a bit more accurate. It helps to manually advance the tape until the next dot is right there.,5
B001B1YTWW,I recently started a sticker collection and these glue dots help place my stickers in a folder where the stickers can be displayed but also be preserved. It is a bit tricky to get used to them at first because it is a really good adhesive.,5
B001B1YTWW,"Just received these.  As another reviewer said, they take a few tries to get the hang of affixing them from the roll.  i am affixing a plastic coin sleeve to a card.  They stick fine to both pieces and I was able to roll it off to remove it from the paper without any sign of it tearing or even having been there in the first place.",5
B001B1YTWW,Once you have these you will find a million uses for them.,5
B001B1YTWW,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I used these to stick up a bunch of those soft fake roses to my walls. Worked pretty well and zero damage to my walls/paint. (See my attached video)A few didn't adhere as well to my banister I think because it was a super shiny finish, but regular walls were good.Totally recommend getting the dispenser over sheets of these, I think it would be a pain if I had to pull these from a sheet, so just go with the dispenser!For a good removable adhesive I was very happy and would recommend.",5
B001B1YTWW,"The glue dots did not come off/out of the dispenser as it should.  Would have been easier and better to just get strips or the pages of glue dots. The adhesive on them were on point, just not as easy to use as it should.",4
B001B1YTWW,"I hate peeling the did off of the paper so I got this hoping it'd be easier.  It is easier to get the dots off, but I find I'm wasting some too. You can't see if the dots have come off the dispenser so I wasted some just trying to make sure I got one.After using it for a while I got used to how to use it, but I wasted quite a few.",3
B001B1YTWW,"The glue dots adhered to paper okay but I tried to adhere the dots to glass vases and it was a fail.  Even though I put a lot of dots on the vase, the ribbon I attached would not stay on the vase.  I kept pressing in the ribbon but finally, I took off the ribbon.  The glue dots were easy to remove.  That's a plus!",3
B001B1YTWW,Made sealing newsletter mail outs so much easier!,5
B001B1YTWW,Had a hard time transferring the dots off the tape,2
B001B1YTWW,"These things are awesome! I use them for all kinds of things. If you are unsure of what they are or if you need them I will make it simple. You know when you get a credit card, or some kind of other card in the mail, and you peel it off the paper and there is that sticky gluey stuff that was holding it on there but magically didn't damage the paper or the card? This is that stuff, but in little dots on a handy rolling dispenser. If you are like me and you put gift cards inside birthday cards or other things like that, this stuff is great. It works on all kinds of surfaces and has a ton of uses. This has become a must have in my desk drawer right next to my scotch tape. I have purchased it many times since, and recommend you do too.",5
B001B1YTWW,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought these glue dots specifically to keep my plastic drawer units from sliding around on my fridge shelves, and they work perfectly!I put 3-4 dots on each corner (since there's a bit of a lip on the containers and it's not a flat edge).So far, they're holding up in the cold and keeping their tackiness.",5
B001B1YTWW,"Sadly these did not work well with attaching bat cutouts to the outside of our windows. Despite cleaning our windows with rubbing alcohol and letting dry prior to using, about half our bats fell to the ground.",3
B001B1YTWW,Using the glue dots with this dispenser makes them so much easier to use! We used them for a craft at a birthday party and it helped the activity go by rather quickly and the glue dots were so easy to apply.,5
B001B1YTWW,Works great to hold postersNot trying to put a lot of weight on it.So far so good,5
B001B1YTWW,"Hard to get off the paper, but they do work",5
B001B1YTWW,"First used these when helping a friend put hand tied bows on wedding favors...it saved us so much time and the dots made it so easy. These little dots slide right off onto the paper or whatever else you want to glue onto something or something onto it, and make the entire process much faster.Update 12.26.13Had problems with the glue dots this holiday season--the dots would not hold on medium sized bows, even with multiple dots, nor would they hold more than one layer of wrapping paper--so if you are trying to close the corners of the paper at the end of a box, that won't work with dots.There is also an issue with having to rewind the tape manually, since it comes out in a loop as you go and you have to crank it back in.Still for lightweight projects it might work well.hope this helps",5
B001B1YTWW,"I got these to glue ribbon together around wedding invitations. Many of them didn't stick and I had to fix them. I feel like they would work well on paper, but they didn't work well on the ribbon",5
B001B1YTWW,We had a world map for a travel theme wedding shower. I wanted to mount the map but be able to have the couple keep it. These did the job.,5
B001B1YTWW,Easy to attach hard to remove to reuse,5
B001B1YTWW,This is the only thing I've found that does not harm my stair treads while holding my step pads in place. Holds fast and comes off so easy with NO damage to tread.Great product I am now addicted to Glue Dots !,5
B001B1YTWW,"I scratched my head for days, trying to think of a way to attach some replica coins inside a shadow box display with all sorts of various items. Then one day I received a new credit card in the mail which was attached to a piece of paper with some of this stuff. So I thought I would try it. WOW! These little glue dots were just perfect. They held everything in place just like they are described in the listing. I couldn't be happier. PLUS - They make things really easy to remove if necessary.  What a great product!!",5
B001B1YTWW,These things are cool! Good adhesion but doesn't mess up the walls or cabinets at all. Easy clean up if need be also. Worth the money. These will be my go to's from now on.,5
B001B1YTWW,Bought this to decorate for a bday party: so easy to use my 4 year old niece could do it. Everything stuck to the surfaces great and it did lot peel of my paint upon removal,5
B001B1YTWW,The glue dots are critical to our new student enrollment packets. We appreciate the speedy delivery and the quality of the product.,5
B001B1YTWW,Ripped paint and bits of dry wall off when removed. Do not use on flat surfaces.,3
B001B1YTWW,"These work great for a huge mailing project my work is doing.  Only problem we had is some of the rolls seemed to get ""tightly wound"" at the end.  We solved the problem by using a letter opener toward the back of the dispenser and popping it open slightly at the seam to relieve the pressure.We have used BOXES AND BOXES of these. They hold up well and are good quality!",4
B001B1YTWW,The product is fine.. it was the delivery time that was bad.  Took two weeks and the day I needed it for had passed,1
B001B1YTWW,"Unlike normal adhesive products, Glue Dots are not messy and easy to use. It won't cause any problems like tape does. The best feature I like about Glue Dots is their removable uses. It's the tape of the future! You can use it on pretty much any type of surface. I recommend you try it for yourself. If you're tired of regular glue and tape, you'll love Glue Dots!",4
B001B1YTWW,"The reason that I gave this as 3 and not a 5 is that the 2nd dispenser was defective. I did not know this until several months later. I was at Sunday school with the kids on an art project, and the new dispenser was supposed to have 200 dots and it had only a few. I pulled out the tape and there was a few here & there. This came from an unopened package. Very disappointed & so were the kids. Too late to return for another one.I will purchase again, because I do love the product, but hopefully the quality control is done, and I will get a full dispenser of 200 dots & not just a few The first dispenser was perfect.",3
B001B1YTWW,"We use these to stick blister packs together. Each blister pack weighs about 6 oz. We needed three (3) dots to hold them together at the bare minimum. Removing is easy. Application wheel has a tactile gear feedback, but it's not always easy to know exactly where the dots are on the roll so every 30 dots or so we'd have four (4) dots instead of three by mistake. If they print index markers such as a red dot or red line on the roll we would wholeheartedly give them five stars.",4
B001B1YTWW,"I used these to affix labels to the inside of some parts bins. They are fairly easy to apply and adhere well. Removal is easy and didn't harm anything. The only draw back is that it's difficult to be accurate with the applicator. If you're working in a small area, it will be hard to get the dots exactly where you want them.",4
B001B1YTWW,"These aren't quite as ""removable"" as we were hoping for, but they worked pretty well. We used these to attach a glossy trifold brochure to a glossy cardstock piece. We glued them all and stacked them up for about three weeks before they were used. Some of the dots came right off like they should have but others tore either the brochure or the cardstock piece. If we do this again, we'll get the lowest sticky-ness.",4
B001B1YTWW,"The applicator for the dots is like a tape dispenser.  It's an interesting the way of placing the glue dots where needed.  The  problem for me wasn't the glue dot itself, even though it was thicker than I'd like.  The problem was the flexible magnet material I wished to glue.  The locations of the dots were quite visible because there were little humps.",4
B001B1YTWW,"I used this to place on sunglasses that fit over prescription glasses, specifically on the bridge of the nose piece. I had to break the dispenser so that I could fit the strip of paper with glue dots on the eyeglasses.",3
B001B1YTWW,"I had seen this product used as a way to keep a rug from moving around.  When I tried to apply, they didn't stick to the rug and I had to peel off of the dispenser and physically place them on the rug.  Might work better on a different surface, just didn't work for me on this project.",1
B001B1YTWW,"PROS:  Great way to quickly apply glue dots for projectsCONS:  Be careful to not break the paper strip that the glue dots are dispensed from.  If you do, the dispenser does not work any more. I think if the paper tears, if you catch it before it gets rolled back up into the dispenser, and tape the paper back together, it might keep working.  Didn't happen with me though, I was working too fast.",4
B001B1YTWW,I am very happy with my purchase. I used the removable glue dots to stick coins on paper. The paper went along with a piggy bank for a 6 year old girl's birthday. She was happy to see the written word of the coin and the coin above it; and she then took the coins off and put the coins in her new piggy bank. The glue dots worked perfectly for this. I have used them for many applications. Thank you for a great product.,5
B001B1YTWW,The are great for crafters young and old!,5
B001B1YTWW,Great for light duty. They didn't work so well putting up student cardstock artwork.,3
B001B1YTWW,You find sticking your credit card to the paper when you first receive it on the mail.  Like a booger.,3
B001B1YTWW,"The dispenser makes it impossible to apply in certain positions. This didn't work for what I needed. I was trying to keep a soap figurine standing, wouldn't stick to the soap.",3
B001B1YTWW,"Great product, easy to use and remove.",5
B001B1YTWW,"I had bought removable Glue Dots more than 20 years ago.  They were on a large roll inside of a flat carton.  It was a large quantity.  I loved them.  They were extremely useful.  However, after over 20 years, they no longer would stick.  I thought I would try these newer removable Glue Dots in a small plastic applicator.  None of them stuck worth a darn.  Even when rolling them out onto paper, I couldn't get them to stick where I wanted them.  I wasted so many.  They are useless.  If you can afford to buy the ones in a large box, go that route.  It is a large quantity, but they are much higher quality.  Don't waste your money on these in the Dot N' Go dispensers.",1
B001B1YTWW,"Easy to use, easy to remove.  I keep a roll on hand!",5

The larger brush I used to paint cabinets, but ultimately had to go back over with a second coat using a cabinet / door roller. The brush didn't give me a perfect, smooth finish. I think there are better brushes for smoother finishes. If your project requires a stiffer, harder brush then this will do the trick. It definitely holds a lot of paint and functions well. The large brush is thick. It's easy to hold. The smaller one is no different than any other stencil brush.",4
B07CQ8G86Z,This was the perfect painting brush for crevices and decorative accents on furniture; I used the larger brush for most of my bedroom furniture; I was tired of the dark  brown; Walls were a type of brown; so I bought Drop Cloth chalk paint from amazon and got to work; These brushes were perfect and made very well and made to last;,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Nice sturdy handles. Good quality bristles. Very good product,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Nothing fancy about these. I would rather paint with an ordinary paintbrush to be honest.,3
B07CQ8G86Z,They worked well for me. I used them to make paint.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,These are my favorite brushes to work with chalk paint,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Was exactly what I was looking for.  Ordered & delivered easily & timely.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,I like it,5
B07CQ8G86Z,I use these brushes primarily for chalk paint on furniture or wood. Easy to handle & wash.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"Best deal for application of chaulk paint.  Good price, use it and throw it away",5
B07CQ8G86Z,I love the feel of the bristles and how smoothly they move over the wood with the beeswax I am using.  Definitely recommend!,5
B07CQ8G86Z,They look just like the photo. I used the large one to apply beeswax wood protector to the drawer tracks of my dresser to polish it up and condition it.,5

B07CQ8G86Z,Perfect brushes for stencils; minimal shedding and very easy to use,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"These were perfect for my chalk paint covergage.  A few bristles came out, but otherwise they help up nicely",5
B07CQ8G86Z,The large brush was very large. Seemed to work ok. Have not used small one.,4
B07CQ8G86Z,Great for what I needed this for !,5
B07CQ8G86Z,It's the paint. Mad about,5
B07CQ8G86Z,This was my first time using chalk paint and this type of brush and I really liked the finish when I was done.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,These feel hefty and solid in the hand. I didn't get any loose bristles in my project and the large brush gives great coverage.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"(Pics 1-4)=Brushes arrive boxed with easy instructions to follow (Pic 5)=Large brush 9"" long.

Naturally if you put it under a microscope NOTHING is perfect..........These brushes, for the money I paid ($13.53+tx) it's a fair price. Go to Joanns or Michaels and pay more and read lower reviews.  I've purchased more expensive standard paint brushes and it isn't always a=you get what you pay for=world. Bottom line is.........follow the instructions on preparing the brush, use as intended, and take care of it.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,I was impressed by the quality of the brushes.,5

B07CQ8G86Z,I had no idea that brushes were made specifically for working with chalk paint! I had previously painted my kitchen cabinets using regular brushes and have areas that I still would like to go back and fix. I painted a bed and a table using these brushes and the finish was perfect!,5

B07CQ8G86Z,"These are by far my favorite brushes. I just bought them again because I buy accident. Use them in oil paint and let them sit out. I use them for almost every furniture flip I do to put the wax on the top, goes on so easy with these brushes.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Loved these brushes,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Works well,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Nice shape of brush and handle.  Easy,5
B07CQ8G86Z,good brushes nice set,5
B07CQ8G86Z,With the little ones out of school this helps keep them occupied and allows for creativity rather than playing video games all day.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Brushes worked perfect for my project!,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Both brushes loose some bristles when used.,4
B07CQ8G86Z,The chalk brush was great. Cover the cabinet I was working on nice and even. And the wax brush worked well also. I was able to spread a nice even coat on the wood. Would recommend these brushes.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,These streaked and the bristles came out in my paint and especially in my wax. I followed the instructions for prepping the brush to ensure there were no loose bristles. The wax brush worked so poorly in general that I switched to putting wax on with a lint free cloth.,2
B07CQ8G86Z,Quality brushes at a great price!,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Easy painting with chalk paint. No brush strokes!,4
B07CQ8G86Z,"I used a regular brush with some chalk paint and it was very clumpy and hard to work with. I decided to bite the bullet and buy these, not expecting much of a difference. After using them, I wish I started with these!",4
B07CQ8G86Z,"I purchased these to use for stenciling a wall. I mainly only used the large brush, as my stencils were quite big. There was very minimal shedding, and it stood up to multiple rinses well.  Definitely worth the price compared to much more costly brushes!",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Best brushes I've literally ever used!!!,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Great value and work really well. Would purchase them again.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,These are extremely comfy to paint with and perfect for clean stenciling.  The shape is oval and very well made.  They clean up very nicely with little effort.  Great value for the price! I highly recommend these brushes and will be purchasing more soon.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Used to apply a wax finish to a dining table that I painted. Worked great. Just what I expected.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Good brushes overall. Bristles did tend to come out occasionally though.,4
B07CQ8G86Z,Used these to paint 2 pieces of furniture this weekend. Great product very little shedding.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"Used to paint furniture. Very soft bristles, easy to maneuver. Held plenty of paint. But still had to use a small paint brush for smaller areas since the small one that came in the set was still too large for some spots. Wasn't surprised by this. Very easy clean up. Love the leather tie, hang it to dry and worked well for me. Thought the price was reasonable.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Awesome product.  Great service,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"I tried these brushes for applying furniture wax to a refinishing project I had. Image on the left was before, and image on right was after. As you can see, the wax was applied very easily. My hands didn't tire from using these and they were easy enough to clean afterwards.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,"I started using a different chalk brush I had bought off Amazon on my table top, literally after 3 coats I could not get rid of the dark patches showing up on my finish and I could not figure out why they were there.  I wasn't sure if it was the paint or the brush.  I decided on my last coat I was going to use a different brush - THIS ONE - and to my amazement the paint was going on smooth and streak freak.  I have no idea what was going on with the other brush, but I will never use it again for painting, maybe I'll save it for waxing (maybe), but never will I use it for paint again.  I will buy at least 2 more of these large oval brushes, I loved it that much!  Glides smoothes and covers wonderfully!",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Both brushes are very good quality. Well made no loose fibers. Used for milk paint did a very fine finish. I would buy again.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,High quality and so easy to use. Love them....,5
B07CQ8G86Z,The bristles are of the right strength and flexibility. Not too soft. Not too stiff. Just right.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,This whole project called for chit brushes and then this brush. How frustrating thought to have the bristles on both sets constantly breaking off in the paint and then in the wax. It was irritating and made it messier. It did get the job done.,4
B07CQ8G86Z,Love how much soppy wet chalk paint these hold! Makes quick work of an otherwise slow and messy job. We are renovating an old camper and have chosen to diy chalk paint the hideous couches rather than cover them. I knew it would take several coats but this made the job so much more pleasant than it would have been with normal paint brushes!,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"I used these brushes to paint a light protective topcoat of Jolie Finishing Wax over light coat of light gray chalk paint on a butcher block countertop I installed over my washer and dryer.  For a picture see my review of the wax written today.My wife and I painted the wax with this brush and then wipe it gently with a soft cotton cloth.  This brush resembles an oversize shaving brush and recommended for painting with Jolie Finishing Wax.The brush was easy to clean with a mineral spirits product that I will review on this site later tonight.I recommend this product to family, friends, and other who plan to paint a protective coat of Jolie Finishing Wax or a similar product on indoor furniture, cabinets, walls, and other items.Enjoy!",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Came as described. Good Quality for the price. Would buy again!,5
B07CQ8G86Z,Love this product.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,I  like the roundness but it is not easy to get into the cracks of the wood or the carving.  I think it does great for waxing though.  Not necessarily for chalk  paint.,4
B07CQ8G86Z,good value for price a few loose bristles,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"This is my first experience with any brushes like these so I may not be the best to review them. I'm also using them to apply polycrylic to my first piece of painted furniture and have never worked with that product before. Having said that, I did read alor of reviews on lots of brushes before choosing these and one big complaint abt others was loose bristles being left behind while painting, etc. I'm on my 3rd coat on the furniture and have only had to get bristles out of the poly about 4 times which doesn't seem bad to me. Aa far as cleaning,  Ive always hated cleaning paint brushes but ive done just what they suggest and simply soaked it in paint thinner for a few minutes, then washed with warm soapy water and hung to dry. They have been ready to use the next day with no problem.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,It was exactly what I ordered,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but the bristle looks great, handle feels smooth and chrome has metal.",4
B07CQ8G86Z,Good product and service,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"I used these brushes for a white washing project on my fire place. I used the larger brush for the base color, the smaller brush for the counter shading, then back to the large brush for the white washing. Super simple and the brush made all the difference!",5
B07CQ8G86Z,"While I'm sure there are higher quality brushes out there, these are a very solid choice for wax brushes. Personally, I prefer a quality synthetic brush for applying paints and if you're looking for a quality chalk paint brush at a good price, search for country chic. Their oval brushes are fantastic. But for waxes or wood salves, these have worked perfectly.DO THE PREP! I've read the complaints about bristle shedding, but if you follow the instructions on how to break the brush in, you'll be fine.",4
B07CQ8G86Z,"As a mixed media artist- I think I am pretty picky about my brushes and I have to say, these brushes are wonderful! They have a good weight to them-- they don't feel lightweight and cheap like some brushes I've used. The bristles are very dense and while they have a firmness to them, they aren't too stiff or rough. They create such luscious texture and I've, thus far, had no shedding. The handles are actual wood and even have a strap at the bottom. At first I thought it was a wrist strap- but unless you have miniature wrists (lol) I'm pretty sure they are to hang your brushes up. The shipping was super fast too! I'm really excited to continue painting with these brushes.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Was difficult to completely clean paint from all the bristles. Overall performed well in painting.,4
B07CQ8G86Z,Good quality,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"The brushed worked very well.  The wax brush did lose a few bristles but think I was pressing too hard on my first project.  Painted a cabinet, 2 coats, and waxed 2 coats.  The price was perfect.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,I only gave a 3 star because you can get  the job done quicker with the big brush but honesty I did not like this set. The handle on the paint brush was huge and caused my hand to cramp up. If you hold it a certain way( not the way I prefer) it will get the job done. I prefer a smaller handle.,3
B07CQ8G86Z,So easy to use,4
B07CQ8G86Z,"I have used both of the brushes and both have been great. They are easy to work with and easy to clean , price wise also have been good, since in retail store you have to pay same price or more for only the big one. I would definitely recommend this product.",5
B07CQ8G86Z,Only used once so far but seems to be a good quality item.,5
B07CQ8G86Z,"Am excited to try the brushes and do my own creative furniture refinishing with these fun perfectly shaped brushes.  Too new to really give a proper evaluation, but very promising.",5
B003A2I4TO,"I use this cardstock with a Cricut Maker 3 to make paper crafts for children aged 2-5. It cuts wonderfully on the Cricut and has a great sturdiness to it. The range of colors to choose from for crafts is unmatched. This cardstock is exceptional!! It's a great value for the number of sheets you get, as well as the quality of the paper, and the bright, contrasting colors. You cannot go wrong with this!",5
B003A2I4TO,I use this with my cricut for crafting. Great quality and price. Nice bright colors.,5
B003A2I4TO,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The colors are so pretty and vibrant. The thickness, texture and sturdiness are on point for my project. This brand will definitely be added to my preferred list. I love it",5
B003A2I4TO,"Nice selection of colors but NEEDS MORE REDS. Otherwise, good quality and selection and quantity.",5
B003A2I4TO,"The brightness and texture are perfect, they also pretty sturdy!",4
B003A2I4TO,Nice colors. Good thickness for crafting.,5
B003A2I4TO,"I did get more than I thought for the price, i thought it would be less paper than what came in the pack. but the paper is the perfect size and very durable. origami may be a little hard because it is thick and the colors of the paper are bright and perfect it's a great variety of color.",5
B003A2I4TO,I love this paper very good quality. I really like the texture on it. Just the right amount. The weight is very good also. Love the paper.,5
B003A2I4TO,"really nice paper and fast shipping, just should have put it in another envelope, the thin plastic that they are in when sold at the store is not for shipping in.",4
B003A2I4TO,"Arrived quickly just what I wanted perfect for scrapbooking or card making, works with Cricut as well",5
B003A2I4TO,"Used for my machine to cut boxes for my daughter's first birthday. Size, texture, and thickness were good to cut through.",5
B003A2I4TO,"I must admit i had thought that these would have been a bit more sturdier but i guess I didn't understand what 65lbs meant in cardstock. Once I am not cutting anything intricate or small, then it's good. I love the colours and the mixture of colours. Aside from the fact that i was a little disappointed in the thickness of the paper it was good.",4
B003A2I4TO,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This cardstock is premium in many ways. It is full color all the way through the paper. I was able to use the paper for this intricate design with no problem! Will definitely repurchase.,5
B003A2I4TO,Love this paper for cutting machine projects.,5
B003A2I4TO,Just as advertised,5
B003A2I4TO,"I love this paper pack! You cannot beat the price, with 4 sheets of 18 different colors, you can make a ton of projects with this single pack. For the price, I tend to buy this over and over if I only need a few sheets of one color, because I will undoubtedly need the other colors in the future. I love the weight and solid color cores, perfect for my Cricut projects on the ""light cardstock"" setting. I use these for shadowboxes all the time and they hold up great!",5
B003A2I4TO,"I should have purchased one of the lower priced returned packs. The sheets are loose, once you take the thin plastic wrap off be careful not to dent them. The quality feels inconsistent per color. The colors are very nice though.",3
B003A2I4TO,This has a really nice selection of colors and grasldirnts of colors. There are generally 3-4 shades of each color which I love.I took 1 star away bc it says it measures 12X12 but it doesn't. It is short by about 1/4 of an inch. When cutting paper out precisely that matters. I needed several cuts to be exactly 12 inches in length but since it's short I have to recalculate the other pieces that go with this. If ypu say 12 it should be 12. If you aren't making precise curs this won't bother you at all.,4
B003A2I4TO,"Nice quality, great assortment of bright colors. Cut easily on Cricut or paper cutter. I use them for scrapbooking and card making.",5
B003A2I4TO,I bought this paper as a starter pack for my sister to use on the Cricut. The colors are very bright and pretty.,4
B003A2I4TO,Would reccommend,5
B003A2I4TO,"Great colors! There nice and thick and are perfect for cards, bookbinding, and cutting machines!",5
B003A2I4TO,I love this paper so much I have it set up in my subscribe and save...the colors are vibrant and it cuts so beautifully with my Cricut!  The quality is superior to many of the cardstocks I have purchased from other brands so I always go back to Astrodesigns and costs much less than many.  Great product!!  :-*,5
B003A2I4TO,"I bought some other paper, so NOT impressed, it stuck to the mats and ruined one.  This paper is much better, good colors.",5
B003A2I4TO,"pretty colors, good range,",5
B003A2I4TO,Good quality. will buy again when I need itThe size is good for use on my cricut.,5
B003A2I4TO,"First off, my paper was delivered in an opened envelope bag on my porch in the rain... So some paper was damaged.Secondly, the paper reminds me of a thicker construction paper.... Not cardstock. I usually get the cheap cardstock from Walmart and it's way more sturdy than this.However I do like the color variety and think it's a good practice cardstock for projects on my cameo. If you plan to use this with a cameo, you will need a lighter tacky mat as the standard one tends to rip this paper.",4
B003A2I4TO,I was skeptical about this cardstock because of the price but it's been great. I have books of cardstock that I have paid more for that aren't nearly as good quality! It cuts beautifully on my Cricut!,5
B003A2I4TO,"Good product, made some boxes to hold treats for thanksgiving",4
B003A2I4TO,I am super excited for this set of paper. I got it for my daughter for christmas to go with her scrapbook I got her. These papers are so colorful and thick. I kind of wish I got some for myself as well.,5
B003A2I4TO,"I have ordered this cardstock several times with no complaints. This time the packaging and colors are  different. There are some nice basic colors but no white, black, pink, the brown is muted and only 1 real purple. The other pkgs had brighter colors.I order this to have a variety of colors, this does as well. Even though the colors are different  I will still use the paper.The quality is very good, this is solid core light weight 65#. I suggest changing the picture.",5
B003A2I4TO,Not the colors I ordered. Completely different set. Orders for specific colors and they were not in set. Nice colors but not the ones I wanted. Needed a Grey and peach color but neither were In there. Not even this cover. Color uploaded was supposed to b Grey. No Grey included.,3
B003A2I4TO,I like the colors and the size is great. You can make lots of things with this card stock. Good price and fast shipping  Exactly as described by seller,5
B003A2I4TO,So papers did arrive kind of peeling up but over all the paper quality is good.. doesnt sparkle enough to my liking,3
B003A2I4TO,"I  liked working with this cardstock, it's has beautiful colors,I like how vibrant they are. I bought this pack awhile ago its goes. That shows I like it! I think it was 8.5 x 11. It was a nice paper, not too heavy or light.  My cricut machines liked it.",5
B003A2I4TO,"I love that the color goes all the way through the cardstock. I've bought others that have a white inside. When you cut it you can see the white, but not on this cardstock. Beautiful color all the way through. Alot of different colors. Perfect weight.",5
B003A2I4TO,"Quality is good, thickness perfect for backgrounds on cards.",5
B003A2I4TO,Good quality cardstock with a good selection of common colors.,5
B003A2I4TO,These are perfect for scrapbooks. They are heavy duty and the double sided tape I used had a hard time sticking the pictures to it. It may have been that the tape was not sticky enough. I recommend playing around with the product you use on the paper to make sure your pictures stay in place.,4
B003A2I4TO,Works great! Cut well in the Cricut. Came off the green mat well.,5
B003A2I4TO,"Great paper, smooth",5
B003A2I4TO,Ok,5
B003A2I4TO,"Used to make paper flowers. The variety of colors was a good mix! For the price I got this for I am happy with my purchase! Shipping was quick and it came in good condition, no bent edges or anything! If it's on a good deal buy multiple in case you need more of a certain color!",5
B003A2I4TO,Nice,5
B003A2I4TO,Works well with my cutting machine. Cricut Air. Love the price and solid core.,5
B003A2I4TO,"I bought to get my paper collection started in my craft room. Vibrant colors, good weight and great price.",5
B003A2I4TO,Ordered this thinking I would get what I ordered before which included white but after getting it I readed the details section that said I could receive either the old or new pack. The new one doesn't include white.,3
B003A2I4TO,I made my first explosion book. It's beautiful this paper is fantastic! All I had was black. Beautiful colors!,5
B003A2I4TO,"I did enjoy using the starter kit, lots of paper.  Used with my Cricut maker 3",3
B003A2I4TO,"The colors are great, the paperweight is awesome and it works well on my Cricut mat. I have not used glue on these, so I am not sure how it would change the texture or quality of the paper.",5
B003A2I4TO,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Used on my cricut to make tags and they came out super cute. The card stock is good quality.,5
B003A2I4TO,Love the vibrant colors and the thickness is perfect for my needs.,5
B003A2I4TO,"This is a good variety and value of quality cardstock. The one thing I would note is that the white is not actually a true white. It has flecks of other colors in it. I was a little disappointed by this, but luckily I have other white cardstock that I can use.",4
B003A2I4TO,I love this cardstock for scrapbooking - I like to design my own pages and these sheets are perfect!,5
B003A2I4TO,"I'm happy with the paper quality and the price, but upset that the colors I wanted are not in the item that shipped!  These are the colors as listed on the pack I received:* Celestial Blue (NOT Royal Blue)* Colonial Blue* Lilac* (NO Concord Grape)* Wisteria* Pulsar Pink (NOT Bubble Gum)* Old Towne Red* Re-Entry Red* Tangerine* Orbit Orange* Tuscan Gold (NOT Galaxy Gold)* Citrus Yellow (NOT Goldenrod)* Lime Green (NOT Martian Green)* Gamma Green* Kraft* Natural* Clove* Stardust White (NOT White)* Eclipse BlackThe problem I have with this is that I needed the Royal Blue for a project, and the Pink, Yellow, and Green are all neons, which I will never use!  For a ""classics"" pack, they changed the colors to a bunch of strange things!  Oh, and by the way, you don't even get a plain white because the Stardust White is speckled with recycled paper!  Amazon should really update this listing because you will not get what is in the description that's for sure.  If they ever offer the bundle with the original colors, I would buy again.",3
B003A2I4TO,"This is a good value for solid-core paper. I can't say I love the colors, but they are okay. It's good to have on hand for making cards and boxes. The solid core of course helps the folds look nice.",5
B003A2I4TO,I use this paper to make cards and paper crafts using my cricut.  The paper is perfect for my crafting purposes.  The colors are nice and bright and the paper is easy to work with.,5
B003A2I4TO,"The cardstock quality itself is fine. My issue is that some of the colors are very different from the previous pack, and I ordered this one specifically because I ran out of some colors making birthday decorations.",3
B003A2I4TO,I always need 12 x 12 cardstock to make envelopes for my handmade cards so I purchased this tablet of multi-color cardstock for that purpose. It creases well and just works perfectly for making envelopes. The weight is 65 lbs which is what I normally use. The price was cut to more than 50% so it was a really good deal and I would purchase this cardstock again at this price.,5
B003A2I4TO,"The weight of this paper is as described; cuts well on digital plotting machine (clean/crisp).  Solid core (not printed on white).  Ordered just to see what it was like; the weight is not as heavy as I prefer for card making and digital cutting, colors included are average/nothing particularly eye-catching--if you just want to use this paper to experiment and do test cuts, it's great for that! I will probably just use it to make custom envelope sizes for my cards.",3
B003A2I4TO,Durable and great quality. Perfect for my Cricut designs.,4
B003A2I4TO,"First off, this is lovely, thick paper for a great price. I don't know why some of the reviewers say it's thin; it feels exactly the same as my Recollections cardstock from Michael's. It contains a lot of beautiful and vibrant colors. There were a couple of problems in the color department: instead of Royal Blue it's Celestial Blue, instead of Bubble Gum it's Pulsar Pink, and instead of Goldenrod it's Solar Yellow. They may have simply renamed the colors. Two beefs with the colors I did receive: first, there is only one pink and it's a VERY bright neon, second, the dark green (""Gamma"") is much brighter than I expected (not a nice forest green). However, I can't really complain too much when it's less than 10 cents a sheet!",4
B003A2I4TO,"Colors are bright and through to the core (meaning when you fold the paper it is not white on the fold line) I used this paper in the Cricut Explorer Air 2 and am extremely happy with the performance from cutting the paper, drawing on the paper, and folding of the paper. I will definitely be buying this product again.",5
B003A2I4TO,"Great starter pack for kids or if you are new to crafting. The weight & sturdiness was lighter than I thought, but I didnt know any better. Slightly thicker than construction paper.Good for less delicate projects or if you are layering. The cardstock is too light for my liking when using it on my cricut, but I am still able to get the job done.",4
B003A2I4TO,I thought this was very good quality paper especially for the price. I am using it for scrapbooking so lignin and acid free paper is important.,5
B003A2I4TO,The price was very reasonable. Received a lot of paper for the money. I needed to add basic colors to my stock of paper and it was just what I needed.,5
B003A2I4TO,"Solid core cardstock is hard to find and here it is.  This is a very good price, lots of colors and solid core for the win.  I am very happy with this item and I have purchased it multiple times.  I use it with my Cricut and it works wonderful.",5
B003A2I4TO,A great multi-pack of cardstock,5
B003A2I4TO,Great quality and love the colors. Works great when making cards,5
B003A2I4TO,"This is very high quality card stock, and I was extremely impressed with the thickness and sturdiness for the price. There seemed to be a lot of 'mat' stock and similar paper offerings on Amazon, but after reading the reviews I concluded that many of them were overpriced or probably made of thin and less useful paper for photo mounting and the like. This pad is large, versatile, full of variety, and extremely good paper.One word of warning: The colors are dark and BOLD. From the product photo, I expected the pink and some of the orange to be a bit more on the pastel side. These colors are HOT with the exceptions of a powder blue and a lavender. The yellows, oranges, pink, and light green are all near-fluorescent. If you want or need more muted tones, I'd get a different color combination.",5
B003A2I4TO,"Excellent quality, cut like a dream on my Silhouette Cameo 4; vibrant colors; great price point.",5
B003A2I4TO,Great for cricut. Very sturdy.,4
B003A2I4TO,"You get a lot for your money, definitely this is worth a buy.  Especially nice if you need a whole bunch of cardstock for die cutting, kids, etc.  I wouldn't recommend it for making boxes.  It's thick enough for a kind of thin greeting card, though.  The colors are nice and vibrant.  I would buy it again.",4
B003A2I4TO,Good value for my buck,4
B003A2I4TO,The paper is sturdy and has a lot of color options,5
B003A2I4TO,I love the color,5
B003A2I4TO,Color and weight of paper just what I needed for some projects I was doing.,5
B003A2I4TO,There are good color choices.  The durability of the paper made it easy for use on projects.  I will order this again.,5
B003A2I4TO,The 12x12 paper is exactly what I needed for several projects.This is the perfect length for cutting box dies.It's also perfect for creating long decorative trims and laces.This paper is just the right size for cutting a box dies.The color assortment is great.I enjoy embellishing the cut outs and embossed items with rub on ink and stamp on ink.  Everything looks great.Lots of fun.,5
B003A2I4TO,Nice to work with. Works well with my Cricut. Terrific variety of colors.,5
B003A2I4TO,Like the colors in this Cardstock book. A lot of colors to choose from. Good for crafts. Arrived quickly.,5
B003A2I4TO,I like the paper thickness and the colors,5
B003A2I4TO,I used this paper for my bulletin boards for work!! Great price and good quality.,5
B003A2I4TO,"I use it to make cards, scrapbook and on my Cricut.  I love this paper.",5
B003A2I4TO,Lots of colors  very sturdy. I use it all the time.,5
B003A2I4TO,I absolutely love this! The pages are bigger in person and the colors are bright and beautiful! This will come in handy for my homemade decor!,5
B001680QSG,Worked as expected jewelry piece is still attached so its been a few months. good stuff,5
B001680QSG,"This glue works really well for jewelry, just be prepared for a strong smell, like super glue. You will want to work in a well-ventilated area and not use it for really long periods of time. It has a thick gel texture, but not as thick and sticky as rubber cement. The thing I really like about it is that I can squeeze some out in a blob to use and it doesn't dry out quickly. In fact, until you put it between two surfaces, it doesn't really start to dry. When you do put it between two surfaces, you have a little bit of time to move things around to get them in the right spot, but not too long. In those first 10-15 seconds, you can pull it back apart if things aren't right, but once it's stuck, it is totally stuck. This definitely gives a much stronger hold than the E6000 that I also use, especially with metal-to-metal. So far, I haven't had anything I've used this on come apart.The only thing I don't like about this is that the lid tends to get glued shut and it's hard to clean off the glue so that this doesn't happen. If it does get stuck, you have to use the main opening, which is harder to control. I don't know how to make this better, but it's the only thing I don't like about this other than the strong smell. Besides that, I definitely recommend this glue.",4
B001680QSG,"This glue worked for what I needed. As advertised, it's a strong adhesive that dries clear. It very effectively attached a couple of metal charms to a stone pendant I had. It also tried to glue my fingers together, but that was my fault. Just know that it dries relatively quickly on the skin, and it definitely gets on your skin when the tube explodes as you open it. I spent about an hour and a half using acetone to dissolve all of the excessive glue off my pendant and my fingernails after the little tube explosion incident. It was messy, but it all worked out in the end.",5
B001680QSG,I use this product on my leather and beadwork. Highly recommend it!,5
B001680QSG,Worked like a charm to repair some sterling silver bezels.,5
B001680QSG,This stuff is strong. It dries super fast so you need to work quickly but I used these to help secure jewelry clasps in a jewelry making frenzy this summer and it worked great!,5
B001680QSG,"I have used other varieties of Aleene's glues, so I decided to give this one a try. The metal part that holds the nose piece on my glasses fell off and I was told that it wasn't covered under the warranty. I tried 6 types of glue and nothing else worked. The Aleene's Jewelry & Metal glue held my glasses together on the first try! It was an excellent value as well, costing less than half of any other metal glue I could find. It also held the handle on my hairbrush, a loose leg on my 40 year old rocking chair, and sealed up a crack that was missing a sliver on the bottom of my iced tea pitcher. *Just be sure to wipe any excess glue off of the tip before replacing the cap. If you don't, you won't be able to get the cap off the next time you need to use it. Happy repairing anything you can think of!!",5
B001680QSG,"Bonds quickly and appears to be a strong bond.  However, this does not dry clear like it says it does.  This dries to a white/grey color.  A good adhesive but if it says it dries clear, it should dry clear, not white/grey.",4
B001680QSG,"It works, but not nearly as well as any other clear gel glue. The trade-off is that it's a little less white when it dries. I'll use the rest, but I will not re-order. Think about it. If you're going to see the glue you'll be using jewelers epoxy, and if not you'll be using the strongest thing you have. This doesn't fit either scenario. At least for me there's better things.",3
B001680QSG,It worked for bonding my lotus flower took a while to set but it turned out great,5
B001680QSG,"Only problem: when towards the end, the tube can spring leaks, making a mess. But this happens with most super-type glue tubes, so...  Other than that, have used this on many things and it has worked well.",4
B001680QSG,Got to fix a 14k gold bracelet for her that was cheaply made,5
B001680QSG,Works well attaching stones on earring parts. But now it is on my fingers.Anyone know hot to remove?,4
B001680QSG,It works good. It drys very fast. It would adhere to anything as long as it had texture on it.,4
B001680QSG,Might be user error but it definitely glued itself shut and then busted out entirely when attempting to open.,3
B001680QSG,"I had some cheap jewelry that I like wearing breaking and this glue did a great job attaching different parts. I especially like it for my stud earrings and gems that fall out. I usually give it a full night to let dry and cure, probably doesn't need that much time but you can never be too safe. My only complaint is a bit of over flow that happens when you open, try some ways to make the tube suck it back in but not much luck. Still a really great strong adhesive for all sorts of material when it comes to jewelry!",4
B001680QSG,Definitely will buy this again! My son broke his glasses and this held them together until we got new ones!!,5
B001680QSG,"I loved how strong the adhesive is, I use it for making earrings. But I am a bit messy and slow, and found that the spills or messes I made would dry faster than I could clean them. Most people aren't going to have that problem, though! lol. Great value for money. Great brand.",4
B001680QSG,The glue takes a little bit to dry. Holds strong once it's dry. Haven't had any problems yet.,5
B001680QSG,"This works great for my purpose - gluing sliced wine corks to metal trays.  But I've had a terrible allergic reaction as well as asthma attack from using it indoors without good ventilation/mask on.  I now ONLY do this outside.  And, wear gloves, don't get it on your skin!!",5
B001680QSG,"I bought this to attach metal shapes to fabric, and although a lot of reviews said it was hard to use because it comes out quick, it still seemed like it would work for what I needed and not fall off the product. The other reviews are so right that the glue comes out really fast; I'm pretty sure I've glued the nozzle to the tube because after poking a small hole in the film with a sewing needle, it still GUSHED out. I've managed not to glue the lid on (yet) and even though the opening at the tip is tiny, it still comes out way faster than you expect. WEAR GLOVES, and protect your clothing, because it WILL stick to your hands (pretty sure I have glue on my finger from two days ago still) and does NOT come off clothes (accidentally got some on my jeans). Despite all this, it still works REALLY well for what I needed. Now I don't have to worry about metal accent pieces falling off the purses I'm making because this glue really does hold stuff in place nicely. You just have to be careful with it and not squeeze the tube too much. Working slow is better or else it comes out SO fast.UPDATE: I've had this for a few months now but I've only used a very small amount of it a handful of times. The lid is now permanently glued on. It's just so viscous and adheres to anything so quickly, it's hard to wipe clean, not get it stuck, and put the cap back on in time. I liked how well it worked on the things I used it on but now 95% of the tube is worthless because I can't get the cap back off any longer. Would work a lot better if it was thicker maybe? Or if it came with multiple caps so when you ruin one you can switch to a new one. I think mine would have been fine if it didn't just keep piling up each time I used it.",3
B001680QSG,I used this glue for the base layer of some stud earrings i made for my daughter and it has very good adhesion.,5
B001680QSG,I use this in my jewelry making mostly for stretch bracelets.  I tie a good night and then put a drop on the knot and it does not come apart.  I've made hundreds of bracelets and not one has ever broken at the knot. the glue dries almost immediately and is very strong.  If you get it on your fingers like I do all the time it takes some work to get it off.  Im very satisfied.,5
B001680QSG,"Works really good for crafting jewelry, metal to metal glues easily together. Nothing has broken apart so far!",5
B001680QSG,"I needed to repair a peice of jewelry , worked great",5
B001680QSG,I received a quick delivery. As this is my initial experience with this product. The product seems to work fine for fashion costume jewelry.,4
B001680QSG,Works great!,5
B001680QSG,Do it yourself fixed jewelry,5
B001680QSG,the product was as advertised,5
B001680QSG,"My mother passed away recently and she had SO much jewelry, including her mother's and grandmother's! There were several vintage pieces that were in need of repairing. I wouldn't trust any other glue. It doesn't leave a residue that looks white, like so many other types of glue can. It only takes a pin head size to hold forever.",5
B001680QSG,I love all sleeves product because they work well. Drys quick with no smell and the adhesive hold well.,4
B001680QSG,"It saved me having to purchase another smart watch. For some reason the face cover of my FitBit Sense, a 2018 purchase came loose, exposing the watch's inner circuitry. It hung off like a broken branch. This glue saved the day! I only needed a few drops and it worked immediately and is still holding the face cover in place.",5
B001680QSG,It is very hit and miss on which piece of earrings it works on. Not much better than superglue or E100 for long term hold.,2
B001680QSG,Works great,5
B001680QSG,"Easy to use, but after not using it for a few weeks, and just barely pushing the middle (not enough to even make a difference) and it completely exploded!! Good product, but not great for long term",3
B001680QSG,There are no negatives about this glue.,5
B001680QSG,"This is the best glue that I have ever used. Purchased this to make and repair jewelry. When I removed the cap and nozzle, I used a needle to puncture the film that covers the opening, so that there would be a slower flow of glue as I squeeze the tube and so that the glue will not clog the nozzle.I applied the glue to a metal bar pinback so that it could be attached to the back of a vintage jewelry rhinestone brooch/pin. Not only was it easy to attach the pin, as soon as I attached the pinback to the brooch, there was an immediate bond. I could not move the pin or remove it, so please be aware of this when you use this glue.  It is transparent when you apply it and when it dries it is clear. The glue is not messy and dries instantly.I wasn't sure if this Aleene's Jewelry & Metal Glue was going to work, but it definitely works far beyond my expectations.",5
B001680QSG,Did not work on my fitbit screen. I needed to seal the screen back on my watch.,2
B001680QSG,"Works on wire, and also on elastic strings. Holds tight. Just don't get any on you unless you have nail polish remover right next to you.",5
B001680QSG,"My son's glasses have a very bad design flaw where the arm has a little post that sits inside the frame. The first time his glasses broke I used gorilla glue. It held for a few days before it broke again. I glued it three times until I was able to bring his glasses in to get a replacement. Well, his replacement glasses had the same thing happen. I tried a different glue and had similar results as the Gorilla glue. I decided to try this jewelry glue since it says it works for metal on metal, which is what I needed. I noticed right away that this glue dries FAST. I have a lot more faith in this glue than the Gorilla glue. I'll update with how long it holds.",4
B001680QSG,"This product is great as far as adhesion and value, but the tip needs to be redesigned as the nozzle is too large for jewelry making. As others have mentioned, it's easier to ditch the nozzle to use a toothpick and poke the tube with a safety pin. I find the plastic toothpicks work best because they have a tapered end - you can get them at $ stores. This product dries fast so it does take some practice, similar to super glue. You have to be careful not to get on your fingers as you will glue them together. Also you have to be quick with your placement of whatever you are gluing, as you won't have much time before it starts to stick. Takes 2-3 days at room temperature to fully cure.I suggest you practice on something disposable before using on semi-precious metals or stones.",4
B001680QSG,It did it job !,4
B001680QSG,"I have used this glue a couple of time now to adhere plastic jewels to metal. Works just as expected, with super quick adherence! Careful, or you'll glue your fingers together, too. Does not work on soft synthetic leather material - I didn't really expect it to, but I tried it anyway.",5
B001680QSG,"I tried this on numerous pieces of jewelry i needed to fix. Silver, sterling, cheap fashion jewelry, metal, etc.  Nothing held",2
B001680QSG,Stong great glue.fixed my broken arm glasses really well! I will use on many other things also.very happy with the product.,5
B001680QSG,Actually does glue metal together.  Great product.  Recommend not getting on fingers as it takes a while to get off.,5
B001680QSG,I got this for a native american bracelet that had small stones on it. I had tried super glue and it dried cloudy so I came across this glue designed for jewelry and it does dry clear. Perfect for my project!,5
B001680QSG,Worked well to secure a rhinestone in a necklace.,5
B001680QSG,I repaired a silver bangle and a stone in an earring.,5
B001680QSG,"Very strong, drys almost instantly, no smell, and seems to very strong bond - very pleased. Great great value for the money",5
B001680QSG,"Glues about anything, but nozzle clogs .",4
B001680QSG,"The pearl keeps coming out of the necklace I inherited from my Mom. I was tired of going back to the jeweler for resettings, so I did some research. This product was highly recommended on various crafting and jewelry sites.Some reviewers complained of messiness, but it was nothing that nail polish remover and a q-tip couldn't clean up. Honestly, the messiness might just be user error anyway (not using as much still does the job).The pearl is snug in it's setting, that's all I needed.",5
B001680QSG,Tired to use as little as possible and still found it to dry cloudy. Pretty easy to remove if froze and picked at.,4
B001680QSG,"Pretty good glue, used it to make some rock jewelry",5
B001680QSG,Apply a small ribbon to the underside of ring that needs to be smaller. It sticks permanently. Perfect,5
B001680QSG,I am happy I found this handy jewelry cement that has come in handy a couple of times.,5
B001680QSG,"This glue is great and it did the job. I had two stainless steal bracelets that wouldn't stay closed, so I found this glue on line. This glue delivered! It bonded instantly and clearly. Plus it's waterproof.",5
B001680QSG,I glued my pearl back on my earrings. It sticks great !,5
B001680QSG,Hold and stick really tight.. excellent!,5
B001680QSG,"I give this two stars for a few reasons.1. It does not stick to metal well as advertised, even when the metal is scored.2. It takes forever to dry and when it does dry it is not that strong of a bond.3. The bottle leaks if set down, with the cap on.4. The despensing of it was often either too little or too much, not coming out at all or coming out as big blobs as though the glue had a bit of an consistency problem, despite being very fluid like at points.  I know human error can play part in that one but after trying it on multiple things and having the same problem over and over again, it is not the glue I recommend. I think i will go back to using super glue.",2
B001680QSG,Received on time and package  great. Everything is working. Would definitely  buy again,5
B001680QSG,It great glue holds very good.,5
B001680QSG,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This glue holds well. It wasn't messy, but if the top was thinner it would be easier to use. Overall , I will purchase again because it secures well.",4
B001680QSG,"Works exactly as expected. My only complaint would be that the glue can sometimes continue flowing out of the tube even with no pressure being applied to the tube, making it a bit messy and difficult to clean, but the flow is minimal and can be easily stopped by recapping quickly.",5
B001680QSG,great,5
B001680QSG,"amazing glue, crappy applicator. no way to stop the glue from bonding to the cap. my tip snapped off at the base after 1st use. update- customer service informedme of the proper way touse the glue and are sending a replacement.",4
B001680QSG,"Great product! Works exactly as described, and an inexpensive, quick way to repair jewelry.I need to glue in a stone that fell out of a ring and repair the post of an earring and this adhesive worked perfectly.I do want to offer a bit of advice when using the product though, a little goes a long way, and be careful when you squeeze the tube because if you squeeze too hard too much of the product comes out and you can't stop it.",5
B001680QSG,Great for tiny spaces and hard to reach areas.,4
B001680QSG,Jewelry & Metal Instant Adhesive Transparent Glue is really good and a new feature with the items that I gift to people/,5
B001680QSG,Jewelry. Glue is hard to fine and good quality and this is has been the best. I use it in all my jewelry if I needed it was a good purchase I recommend it.,5
B001680QSG,I tried it for the first time put a tiny bit to add a crystal to an earring. A high quality crystal. This glue ate up my beautiful crystal well a big part of it.I tried one more crystal and the same thing happened. I used my E6000 worked fine.This glue was sent back. I am glad it works for you. It did suprise me though when my crystal started to disintegrate. Oh yes the glue works great on gluing my fingers together. SMH.,2
B001680QSG,The best jewelry glue I've found. Not too strong smelling. Nothing I have glued had come back apart. I recommend to everyone and I will continue to use and buy. So easy to use. Dries really fast so put whatever you glue right where you want it. It's that fast (thin layers) and that good.,5
B001680QSG,So far the 3 jewelry items I glued have fallen off.  Sadly I do not trust the staying power of the glue. Do what you want with this review. I  myself will be using another brand.,2
B001680QSG,"third time, the cap was glued shut and i had to throw it away.",2
B001680QSG,I only got to use a small amount of it before the lid was glued shut and in trying to get it open destroyed the lid. I take some blame as I was not knowledgeable about jewelry glue. I bought Scotch liquid super glue as it is more user friendly.,2
B001680QSG,Very strong hold. Dries fast. Worth it.,5
B001680QSG,Put my pendant back together,5
B001680QSG,Stone came off my ring. Worked greay. Bond seems permanent.,5
B08P8S4JRR,"Loved these scissors. Great grip, sharp, durable, and easy to use. I bought these because a brand name set did not cut warm butter. Am so glad I made this choice. Great price for a great product. Recommend them to anyone who is a crafter!",5
B08P8S4JRR,"I really like these scissors! They are all very sharp and fit comfortably in my hand. It's really nice having four different sizes for any kind of cutting. I use the smallest ones for my crochet bag and the others for various things around the house. I have small hands, but if you have large hands, the holes for your fingers might be a little small for you. My four fingers fit in the holes just fine, but larger hands might not fit so comfortably. The hole for fingers is smaller than the hole on another pair of my scissors that I already have. The thumb holes are about the same size as my other pair of scissors so they should accommodate even larger hands. I am very happy with this purchase!",5
B08P8S4JRR,This scissors set is very nice . Sharp and durable. Highly recommend and shopping was fast .,5
B08P8S4JRR,"Very sharp, use them a lot. One very odd thing: The last 3/8"" of the blade tips of the 6.4"" pair do not meet? Certainly the pictures in the offering show the blades of all 4 pair fully closed, but of the set I received, this one pair of the set does not. Hmmmm?This actually required some research on my part, i.e., the nomenclature for a pair of scissors. If you look at where the handles come together, you will notice a bump on each handle. These meet when the scissors are fully closed. These bumps are called ""silencers"" or ""bumpers"". So, on the 6.4"" pair, I used a razor knife to cut one off. This almost worked but the tips were still a bit open. So I cut off the other silencer and now the tips meet perfectly.",4
B08P8S4JRR,So far so good! The scissors are comfortable to use and the different sizes are convenient for all purposes. I like them. They are very sharp too and beautifully designed!,5
B08P8S4JRR,Good variety of sizes and sharp,5
B08P8S4JRR,Just received them. Beautiful. Hopefully they will work well and last. Haven't tried them yet.,5
B08P8S4JRR,Great value for Number of scissors. They work very well.,5
B08P8S4JRR,"Basic scissors nothing special, gets the job done",4
B08P8S4JRR,Very high qualityVery low price,5
B08P8S4JRR,Great product especially the price!,5
B08P8S4JRR,As described,4
B08P8S4JRR,"Great scissors, great price! So good, that I'm ordering another pack. Mine seem to disappear...others in my house must like them too!",5
B08P8S4JRR,price and amount you got,5
B08P8S4JRR,Very happy with purchase. Well made.,5
B08P8S4JRR,Highly recommend.,5
B08P8S4JRR,These are very nice.  Different sizes great quality is excellent price was great now I just have to keep hidden from my son. He gets a hold of them I either don't get back or their oily or greasy from work,5
B08P8S4JRR,These are just as described! Very sharp and work great.,5
B08P8S4JRR,"I ordered this set of scissors because I could not find the pair I had.  It turns out, my daughter had used them and left them in the other bathroom.  I was impressed at how sharp these scissors are. Work well for my needs.",5
B08P8S4JRR,"They cut great, but for myself the handles are too small. I wear a size large glove and I can't cut with these for very long and they start to hurt my hand. Just something to consider",3
B08P8S4JRR,they will work out great,4
B08P8S4JRR,A person can't have too many scissors! I like this set. They are sharp and easy to use. One for every need.,5
B08P8S4JRR,Quality office supplies,5
B08P8S4JRR,Good,5
B08P8S4JRR,Sissors very comfortable to use with rubber handles,5
B08P8S4JRR,If you're not picky about your scissors I'd say this is a good deal.They are better than most in this category as far as quality. They're more comfortable than most and they cut better than most.  But they just don't cut as well as a freshly sharpened blade. New scissors should do that.,3
B08P8S4JRR,Excelente,5
B08P8S4JRR,"My old scissors were getting so dull they chipped when I tried to cut some cardboard (this is not an exaggeration). So, to Amazon I came, and found this set. I like that it has two smaller pairs of scissors as well as the larger ones, because that means I can throw some in my sewing bag or school backpack -- they're always useful when you least expect them to be! They're plenty sharp, are balanced pretty well, and cut nicely.",5
B08P8S4JRR,Very nice scissors for crafting.,4
B08P8S4JRR,"Needed new scissors for my craft stuff as the old ones are dull and falling apart - literally.  These feel good in the hand and open and close very smoothly.  I have yet to actually use them for cutting, so I knocked some stars off for that purpose only.  But I am excited to use them this week for my crafting.",4
B08P8S4JRR,"Nice assortment of scissors,",3
B08P8S4JRR,,5
B08P8S4JRR,Needed scissors for work and these are excellent!,5
B08P8S4JRR,I bought these because I needed new scissors. I work at an elementary school so I am cutting a lot. These feel way better than what I had before. And the color looks amazing.,5
B08P8S4JRR,Just what I needed!,5
B08P8S4JRR,Very light scissors.  Love it!,5
B08P8S4JRR,They are perfect!,5
B08P8S4JRR,"Scissors get lost in our home all the time. I told my husband these are mine, do not touch lol.  The scissors are very sharp and I now have a pair in every room.",5
B08P8S4JRR,"Nice and sharp ,great for the price",5
B08P8S4JRR,"Comfortable, soft feel handles, blades are sharp. Love these!",5
B08P8S4JRR,I have a use for each pair and they get used alot and they are still cutting well. So for the price I paid I don't have no complaints at all so I'd have to say I'm very satisfied,5
B08P8S4JRR,"Good results, very sharp",5
B08P8S4JRR,5 sizes good quality,5
B08P8S4JRR,All different sizes to fit your needs !,5
B08P8S4JRR,DO NOT HAVE CAMERA PACK OF DIFFERENT SIZE...SCISSORS SOME REGULAR SIZE SOME SMALL. HARD TIME OPENING ITEMS I USE ALL KINDS OF.SCISSORS,5
B08P8S4JRR,There is a scissors for every need. They are sharp and feel comfortable when using them. Great value for the price.,4
B08P8S4JRR,"These scissors are sturdy, easy to use, very sharp. I am happy with them",4
B08P8S4JRR,Good scissors for office use.  Good quality and very sharp,5
B08P8S4JRR,"I love the sharpness and ease in which these these scissors work.  Good quality so I know they'll last.  Cheap, dollar store scissors end up in the trashcan and are useless.  These are excellent and are only about $1 per pair more per item.",5
B08P8S4JRR,They have seemed to wear somewhat quickly but still work. There are four pair of scissors all different. In an easy open blister pack. Nice display packaging. Great for lots of things like opening packages and mail. Crafts or anything else that you want.,4
B08P8S4JRR,"Not my sewing scissors quality but good enough for everyday uses. Some in kitchen, bath, and office and my sewing scissors are once again safe...",5
B08P8S4JRR,"I love these scissors so much, I've bought two sets of them; one for the office and one for home. They are well balanced, comfortable grip and cut wonderfully. The smaller ones are perfect for scrapbooking.  You can do very fine cutting with them. The value is perfect as you get 4 pair of scissors. Great to have.",5
B08P8S4JRR,"I love these scissors! There are 2 large size, one medium, and one smaller. They are sharp and cut very easily. Having 3 different sizes let's me put 1 in each room where needed. The quality of these scissors for this price is crazy great!",5
B08P8S4JRR,"Good value for what you get, although they are not the best. Work on fabric and thread, and that you get multiple so I have left them where I need them so they are always handy.",4
B08P8S4JRR,Very sharp but I bought scissors because I needed them not the best idea to have the packaging need scissors to open,4
B08P8S4JRR,"these scissors are terrific, they work great and seem durable.",5
B08P8S4JRR,I needed these as a pair I had for a long had broken. Love assortment and the quality was great. Highly recommend them.,5
B08P8S4JRR,"These scissors are a nice blue and they cut pretty well for the price, well, at least, the larger ones do. I have not had an opportunity to fussy cut with the two smaller ones, but after using the larger scissors,  I do not have high hopes for them as fussy cutters; they need to be really accurate and so I think you wii need to spend more money to get a really good pair of fussy cutters.",4
B08P8S4JRR,These are pretty good scissors with a nice assortment of sizes.,5
B08P8S4JRR,They are sharp enough to do what is needed !!Great for fabrics.. an crafts,5
B08P8S4JRR,Great set of scissors. Cones in four convenient sizes. Nice and sharp. Cuts well,5
B08P8S4JRR,"I have a use for every size of these scissors. They are sharp, lightweight and the handholds are padded .",5
B08P8S4JRR,Nice product. Built well,5
B08P8S4JRR,"The scissors are great, especially for the price. However the package was open when it arrived. It is not as though the plastic split apart due to shipping, rather the top of the packaging had been cut to open and then mostly likely returned.",3
B08P8S4JRR,The package arrived open & possibly used,2
B08P8S4JRR,"Everything you would want scissors to be, and a great deal at the price for all the pairs. I now have scissors in all the rooms I wanted them - it's so nice not to have to hunt for scissors. Do not hesitate to order. Thanks to the seller for a great deal!",5
B08P8S4JRR,Buen material,5
B08P8S4JRR,"Good set. Not heavy duty, but worth the price.",4
B08P8S4JRR,All the different sizes works very well,5
B08P8S4JRR,This is a very good deal for this set and the scissors are very nice too. Very sharp and great for what I  needed them for.,5
B08P8S4JRR,"I love my new pack of scissors and being able to cut things neatly. There is no drama or anger involved with cutting now, and that makes everyone around me happy also.",5
B08P8S4JRR,Very pleased with these scissors.  I have moved the largest in to my sewing box because it does a great job on upholstery fabric.  Use the medium ones in the kitchen to open thick coated bags of pet chow and treats and heavyweight food bags. Use small ones for hand sewing and manicuring small houseplants. Each one has found a special use - love this set.  Have arthritis in my thumbs so these make my tasks much easier.,5
B08P8S4JRR,It's very very very durable and sharp but I was hoping to break these apart and make throwing knives with the two half's of the scissors I tried hammering them apart and everything but nothing worked so it's safe to say there durable,5
B08P8S4JRR,This is such a good buy.  I get so tired of looking for my scissors in a house of 5 people.  This is my solution.  They are well made and sharp!,5
B08P8S4JRR,Gifted,4
B08P8S4JRR,I like the material it's made of for as mentioned it makes it easy to handle when cooking. I also like the color,5

B08P8S4JRR,Good quality and price.  Nice to have a variety of sizes.,5
B08P8S4JRR,These are great! 4 different sizes for all different types of uses. The best part was the easy-to-open pull tab on the back of the packaging!,5
B08P8S4JRR,They work great. Sharp and cause for anything.,5
B08P8S4JRR,These are easy to hold. Especially for me. Cause I have many hand issues. And they are truly the best scissors I have purchased in many years..,5
B08P8S4JRR,Great for the price.,5
B08P8S4JRR,this was a great buy===excellent product for the money,5
B08P8S4JRR,Can't go wrong with 5 pairs for about $10,5
B08P8S4JRR,Sharp durable sizers they can cut paper and cardboard. The amount of sizers in the pack is supper useful because you can have them all around your house for a low cost. There easy to use and hold supper smooth.,5
B08P8S4JRR,I'm glad I picked thus pack.  Very sharp.  I love the different sizes  the price was vert good.  Received next day.,5
B08P8S4JRR,"I needed another pair of scissors because the ones I had to open packages has grown legs and walked away. I was happy to find this inexpensive set of 4 so now, should one disappear, I'll have a backup.But as it may, it seems to be a type of oxymoron that I would need a pair of scissors to open the package of scissors....but alas they have perforated the back of the package to make it easier to get the scissors out.",5
B08P8S4JRR,Every size a household needs in one package!!!,5
B08P8S4JRR,I love this set! Well made. Very durable. Sharp. Great quality. Love the assorted sizes. I have zero complaints. Plus the price for this set is just as amazing as the product. They cut nicely. Feel good in your hand. Have a nice balance to them. Don't hesitate. If you need scissors you can't go wrong with these.Amazons delivery was amazing as usual! Thank you Amazon for carrying quality products and shipping so quickly,5
B08P8S4JRR,I needed some scissors and these were a great and fast option,5
B00006IFNA,"Great quality and design. Very sharp, perfect edges that allow to do precise cuts. High quality of blades and plastic.",5
B00006IFNA,"Perfect little scissors, extremely sharp. I am left handed, have small hands and they fit very well and are easy to use.",5
B00006IFNA,"Sharp all the way to the tips. They are handling the felt that I'm working with just fine. The loops could be a bit bigger to get my less-than-dainty fingers in & out, but they're not uncomfortable while cutting.",5
B00006IFNA,I have had a pair of these scissors in my sewing room right next to my sewing machine for years.  Great for quilting and sewing.  Small enough to use while I bind quilts and do hand stitching.  I ordered these as gifts for to go along with embroidery kits.  I know they will love them.,5
B00006IFNA,"These little scissors were purchases so I could have assistance opening my pills. I needed something pointy and sharp to poke into the side, then lift up the center of the slit to free the pills.These drug manufacturers don't make it easy to take the pills. I have to peel back a backing that always gives me trouble. Then after I miss with it I can push them through.Love my scissors! My life is easier now. They are really are functional and very sturdy.",5
B00006IFNA,"I would have given these 5 stars but I should have read the fine print. I thought Fiskars scissors were made in Finland but upon receiving these scissors, I found that they are made in China. That's a 1 star deduction at the least. Other than that, the scissors seem sharp, cut well enough and seem of decent quality. The handles are made of plastic and that is my only concern other than blade sharpness retention. Time will tell. My advice is to check ALL product details in the description because not all Fiskars are from Finland. Many models are from China and we all know how their products stand the test of time and reliability.",4
B00006IFNA,They're Fiskars.  excellent scissors,5
B00006IFNA,Love it!,5
B00006IFNA,I like that these have small sharp tips. Size is perfect for working with my cross stitch. Light and easy to use.,5
B00006IFNA,I do plastic canvas and finding a pair of small snipers that stay sharp was not easy.  Fiskars was always my mom's favorite scissor brand and now I know  why!,5
B00006IFNA,"They may be fabric scissors, but I use them for trimming nose, ear, and eyebrow hairs. Precise, wonderfully sharp (be careful!!). Sadly, my last pair was confiscated by airport security, even though they have traveled with me for years. I'll be more careful with my packing and put the new pair in checked luggage going forward.",5
B00006IFNA,Fiskars quality but made in China. Hope it holds up.,4
B00006IFNA,"I expected these to be typical larger fabric scissors.  They are the size of children's scissors. They are sharp, but I don't think they are study enough to cut through heavier fabric such as jeans. These are better for more precise cutting, not a general fabric scissor",4
B00006IFNA,I have ever been disappointed with Fiskar scissors. This small size is perfect for use in my office and for removing small bits of matted fur from the cat.,5
B00006IFNA,"My boss has a pair of this scissors from I started working with her. It's been twenty years and it's still sharp as ever. I am very happy I bought this, I do a lot of crochet work and it's very sharp and handy for cutting threads. Will be buying a few more in this brand.",5
B00006IFNA,Bought these little scissors for quilting and they are the perfect size,5
B00006IFNA,"These scissors are great. Very sharp. Can easily cut fabric, magnets, and hair.",5
B00006IFNA,have always loved Fiskers...sent my old pair to the kitchen in place if the new set! Also have a pair of pruning shears - love them all!,5
B00006IFNA,It works as expected,5
B00006IFNA,"I lost my little fiskers and ordered these to replace what was lost. Love these little, SHARP scissors.",5
B00006IFNA,Excellent scissors,5
B00006IFNA,Perfect size and very sharp,5
B00006IFNA,Love these but not sure how to keep them sharp. Used all the time.,4
B00006IFNA,"As a crafter, these Fiskars non-stick blade scissors are a must have!  I use a lot of double sided tape for my projects and these are perfect for cutting through that.  I am going to be purchasing more to give as gifts to my fellow crafty friends.",5
B00006IFNA,"When i first ordered this item I was sent a product that had been opened and taped shut with like a white, medical type tape.  Was super annoyed because I thought I purchased a product in NEW condition.  Amazon sent me another pair and I didn't have to take my time with a return, so I guess it worked out, BUT the product itself?  Amazing!  I love these little scissors.  I'm just super tired of Amazon thinking it's okay to send people open/defective products for their hard-earned money without being transparent about it!  I know they ""made it right"", but still had to take time dealing with it, which is not cool.  Do not hesitate with the actual product itself though, it's great!",5
B00006IFNA,Nice & sharp,5
B00006IFNA,"I needed a pair of 5 inch scissors recently so I chose these stitcher scissors made by Fiskars.  I'm not exactly sure what the difference is though, between these five inch scissors and the regular little five inch scissors that are more common.  Except that the hinge for these is on the blades and the hinge for the more common ones is on the handle grips.  But regardless of that, these little scissors operate beautifully, and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is considering getting them.",5
B00006IFNA,Sharp and high quality. The small size allows for storage in a hobby box.,5
B00006IFNA,These are good scissors. Small and pointy.,5
B00006IFNA,Na,4
B00006IFNA,Got these to cut my chicken feathers so they can't fly,5
B00006IFNA,Good,5
B00006IFNA,My second pair!  Love the size and the sharpnesses!,5
B00006IFNA,These are awesome small scissors that are extremely sharp with a great pointed tip.I had some felt like material that my other scissors would not cut through. These scissors cut through the material like it was BUTT ER!They are perfect for all my crafting projects.,5
B00006IFNA,I have been one to purchase Fiskars scissors in the past with good results.  I purchased these while traveling as I needed them while doing some hand sewing.,5
B00006IFNA,Just what I was looking for.,4
B00006IFNA,"Perfect small size, sharp point and cuts very easily, no rough cur.",5
B00006IFNA,"These are a *excellent*!  Sharp, pointed, feel great in the hand.  These are in my emergency hiking medical kit because they are the ones I'd trust if I had to snip off a bit of damaged skin or something.",5
B00006IFNA,"I bought these because they are a little bigger than the Fiskars 4 Inch Detail Scissors I bought10 or so years ago, but I can now see why they cost half as much.  These simply do not cut detail as well as those I purchased earlier.  I bought based on the brand figuring that I would get similar quality.  I am extremely disappointed, but I'll use them for general utility work and buy another pair of the smaller ones for detail.  What an incredible difference in the precision with which each cuts.  I have to practically saw through - force my way through - the thin paper, bandages, sewing thread, and other such light weight items for which I purchased this second pair.As I mentioned above...  Extremely Disappointed.  I would not recommend these based on my recent experience.",3
B00006IFNA,Great scissors very sharp and Great to keep by my machine,5
B00006IFNA,"I bought these for a trip. I previously bought some cute gold scissors that didn't work, then thought about my sewing scissors I've had for probably 12 years. They're the only pair of scissors to work and not give out on me. After a search for a small pair of the same brand, found these and they work well on a thinner piece of cardboard paper. I already want another pair for my bathroom.I'm also left-handed and worried about that being an issue. it isn't and the scissors worked well.",5
B00006IFNA,"I always keep a pair of these scissors on me. I love the quality. I use them for sewing, cutting and harvesting herbs as well as flowers. I cut my hair with them too. Highly recommend.",5
B00006IFNA,"I love Fiskars! I never had the small ones like this, but they are perfect for sewing tasks, plus I used them with success cutting the edges off of felt backing for an art project. I am left handed, and they worked fine for me (in the larger scissors, I have left-handed versions). I wish they came with a case so I could protect the points, but I put them back in their plastic form on the cardboard backing and taped it up so it works for now.",5
B00006IFNA,"Fiskars scissors are the best, in my opinion. As a professional seamstress I require many types of scissors, but the common requirement is that they be very sharp. Fiskars are true to that ideal. These small micro-tip scissors are best for snipping threads close to the fabric quickly and cleanly at the beginning and end of seams, or making tiny cuts that require a great deal of precision. I use these with everything I sew and would be lost without them. You can't go wrong, ever, with Fiskars brand scissors. An orange handle doesn't mean it's Fiskars quality. Look for the name and don't be fooled into buying something that looks like it. They last forever, too, as long as you don't damage them in some way.",5
B00006IFNA,Good product from a good seller. Win win.  Thanks!,5
B00006IFNA,I use this for everything sewing. I keep a pair handy . They last a long time if you don't lose them.,5
B00006IFNA,"I've been doing a lot of work with seed beads lately.  I'd been trying to cut my thread (usually nymo) with whatever scissors I had lying around.  This led to messy cuts and ugly-looking thread ends.  It really is better to have a dedicated pair of scissors for beading (and not to use the same ones you open packages with...), especially ones with a tiny tip like this.Anyway, I bought these because the product description said they cut through multiple layers of cloth.  I figured if they would cut cloth, they would be excellent for nylon thread.  And I was right.  I get really neat cuts through my thread on the first attempt with no fraying.  The cuts are such that it is easy to thread a needle afterwards.  The edges are quite sharp and the tip is a fine point, so you can get in close to the work.  These are not the same as using a thread burner for beadwork, but they're about as close as you can otherwise get.5 inches is the total length and these are made in China.  Mine arrived in excellent condition with no rust.  The fulcrum operates easily but is not loose.  These do not have any kind of sheath, they are just on a cardboard backing with a plastic cover to hold them in place.  Now all I have to do is train myself to reach for other scissors when it is time to open packages so I can keep these nice!",5
B00006IFNA,They do not feel good in my hand. Odd as I do like the brand. The blade is sharp. Feel more like kid scissor that are too sharp for them. Not my favorite.,3
B00006IFNA,Smart and very sharp !!!,5
B00006IFNA,"Very sharp, I keep pair by sewing machine and one on middle compartment of car.  Scissors come in handy for snipping those little packs of catsup that I never can tear easily without a mess.",5
B00006IFNA,"I grew up with a professional seamstress. My mother was very talented She had clients constantly. She worked from home with 3 children always asking for something from her. I have watched her make 4 complete dresses in one day and still have supper warming on the stove and the house spic and span. Fiskars scissors were the only scissors she used. She tried teaching me to sew when I was young, so I too love Fiskars. I was never as good at sewing as she was, but I keep the right supplies ready, including my mother's pair of Fiskar scissors. I keep a  ribbon tied to the handle so everyone in my house knows not to touch these scissors to anything but fabric. I lost my mother when she was 60. Now I am two years older then she was when we lost her suddenly.  I wanted a larger pair then the one I have for a project I am working on. It was a very easy purchase. I knew what brand I was buying, and these came with two pair so now I am complete with 3 different sizes of the best scissors I have ever had. It is a company and product I trust in. The cutting is so smooth. They whip around curves easily as well as making my job easier on the straight cuts.  I love the sound of the scissors as I cut around my patterns on the table. It brings me a smile from years long ago. I would recommend these to anyone. Wonderful product.",5
B00006IFNA,Extremely shape.  Great for detail work. Wonderful price.,5
B00006IFNA,It feels so good to cut with these scissors. Both pair.  I can even cut rather intricate corners and curves with the regular pair.Glad I bought these.,5
B00006IFNA,"For the money, I don't think you would be able to find nicer scissors. I find this brand to be dependable for years, provided they are not abused by cutting inappropriate items.",4
B00006IFNA,Excellent quality cutting instrument.,5
B00006IFNA,Love the scissors!!!,5
B00006IFNA,"Can't go wrong with these Fiskars Curved Scissors. I use them to trim faux leather, paper and more. You can get into small spaces and the curve helps with trim work. Bought a pair for my daughter too.",5
B00006IFNA,These are terrific little scissors and easily portable.  I do wish they came with a small case or sleeve to prevent stabbing whatever they are stored in.  The tips are so sharp that they will poke through a pencil or sewing bag.  I had to fashion a foam piece to stick them in when not in use so they won't damage anything.,5
B00006IFNA,These scissors are so handy to clip threads as I sew or do needle work. I found out just how sharp they were in a freak accident that I could never recreate. They fell of my sewing table as I stood up and the point went in my thigh at least 1/2 to 3/4 inch.,5
B00006IFNA,"Fiskars is a very good brand and I've used them for years.  I ordered the small sets due to intricate cutting, but I found that the small scissors, when opening and closing stick or tight.  Intricate work requires smooth opening and closing otherwise jagged edges occur.  I decided to drop a little oil on the joint which helped but is still a little tight.  If using oil make sure to wipe so there is no transfer to fabric or craft you are working on. I will keep them for other projects as they are a good brand.",3
B00006IFNA,"I had to buy a new pair after I left my old pair inside a sewing machine I donated.  But if you want to cut thread when sewing so there's a nice end on it without grabbing a giant pair of scissors, these are the scissors for you.  My old pair never seemed to get dull.  Don't use them for anything else except material.",5
B00006IFNA,Fiskers are the best! going to purchase a 2nd pair,5
B00006IFNA,We love using these scissors in our embroidery business to get super close to the fabric for cutting out applique. Sharp snd easy to use.,5
B00006IFNA,Great pair of smaller scissors.,5
B00006IFNA,Since these where on sale I absolutely had to buy them cause I know the brand is really good  And I was not disappointed one of the few things I would buy at full price.,5
B00006IFNA,Consistent and high quality.  Great for embroidery.  Recommended,5
B00006IFNA,"I wanted a small set of scissors for removal of tattered threads from older towels and garments. These are perfect for my needs. They are razor sharp and well made. The blades are properly aligned, making cuts quick and efficient.",5
B00006IFNA,These are great little scissors.,5
B00006IFNA,"These cut fine materials as good as my $50 razor scissors and last years instead of months.  If you keep them to cutting natural materials and not the larger synthetics these will stay sharp as long as anything twice their price and more, but I also bought their sharpener and give them a few swipes before a session.  My favorite pair are still sharp after 5 years and I tie 5 days a week.  Got real sick of spending $200+ a year replacing other scissors that start dulling a month or two after you bought them.  I tie down to sz 20s and up to the big articulated streamers and they work fine.  I use a razor blade for anything these can't do.",5
B00006IFNA,"sharp, hard steel, good for detailed cuts",5
B00006IFNA,These are the best crafting scissors out there.  Sharp and durable I never have an issue using these.  They cut through my yarn with ease.  So happy I found these!,5
B00006IFNA,Work perfectly.  Cuts tiny threads.,5
B00006IFNA,Happy with these. We tried another brand but they were lightweight and rather cheap (I guess if I went to the sewing store to by that brand it would have been better). Fiskars is always a good choice,5
B00006IFNA,"These scissors are incredibly sharp, they will definitely work for any precise project. One downside though is the hole size. If you have a bigger thumb it can get uncomfortable to cut after a while. I love the angled tip thought, makes it super easy to see exactly where you are cutting, which has saved me so many times from cutting too far. 100% recommend these to anyone.",4
B00006IFNA,Nice pair of scissors. Great for cutting yarn and needlework. Nice and sharp,5
B00006IFNA,I do a lot of cutting of images on paper. These little curved scissors are perfect to get into those little places that have a curve to cut around. Could not do my crafts without these curved scissors.,5
B00006IFNA,My mother purchased these scissors for a Christmas gift for another family member.  I highly recommend them. I have sewn for many years and find fiskars to be the best brand of sewing scissors.  They cut with ease.  As with most sewing scissors they cannot be used to cut other things such as paper.,5
B00006IFNA,"True to Fiskars reputation, these sewing scissors are perfect!  They're small in the hand, very sharp and easy to maneuver.  I'm glad I bought them!",5
B00006IFNA,"I've long used various versions of Fiskars craft scissors for beard trimming ""clean up"".They're very sharp & precise. This version is long enough to be efficient, but short enough to be allowed to fly in carry-on luggage on domestic US flights. They're also well-designed for removing tags, cutting threads, and other random uses you'll find for them on every travel.A new pair is slightly tighter but loosens with use. In over 25 years I've used them, I've never had a pair come apart or break.Overall-- I keep buying these and hope they keep making them. Highly Recommended.",5
B00006IFNA,THANKS,5
B00006IFNA,They are a great small scissors for your sewing box or everyday clipping.,5
B00006IFNA,"These are very sharp scissors that I used for fussy cutting small ephemera pieces for my ""Women in History"" hand made junk journal folios.  Makes detail cutting fun.",5
B00006IFNA,Machine embroidery creates a lot of thread ends on the back of each design. These scissors are perfect for trimming those pesky threads. And of course Fiskar has the lifetime warranty,5
B00006IFNA,"If you've read any of the customer reviews for this particular item, you'll understand when I say ""I got lucky!""  My scissors as well as the packaging say made in Finland. I've yet to buy/use a pair of Fiskars scissors that I wasn't happy with. (My most favorite were purchased on a whim off of a closeout table. They are unique in that the blades slide into a magnetic backed holder allowing one to stick it to the fridge or wherever you feel the handiest location might be. They're five years old, I use them literally every day (kitchen stuff only) and they are still as sharp as ever.)But I digress. I bought the ""No. 5 Stitcher Scissors"" to use strictly for cutting decoupage. The stainless blades are super sharp with sharp points. The blades move effortlessly and are perfect for my chosen use. I see two improvements that could be made. 1) Comfort grip handles would be welcome. These are the standard orange plastic.  2) They're so small and sharp I wish they had a protective plastic piece to slide the blades into. Since they do not, I'm keeping mine in an old hard eyeglasses case which works nicely. Needing a pair of back ups so I'm never without (like this last time) please see my review for EK Tools Precision Scissors, Small, New Package. I think they are superior to the Fiskars. All my reviews are posted as Serious Shopper.",5
B00006IFNA,Bought these to replace a pair I had.  love them.,5
B00006IFNA,This little scissor is sharp and handy for all kinds of cutting needs. It would be great for sewing as well as paper craft.  I trust the Fiskar brand!,5
B00006IFNA,This is my second pair. I thought I lost mine.  These are amazing g.,5
B00006IFNA,"I've heard so many people say that these little scissors are great but I'm very disappointed.  I just bought this pair and I wanted it to cut thread from embroidery projects.  It's not that great at cutting thread. I have to position the scissor just right so that it can cut and I don't think that's helpful.  I would not recommend this brand.  I'm keeping them just in case I lose my other little scissors.  These definitely need to be sharpened though.  Brand new scissors needing to be sharpened, that's not good.",3
B00006IFNA,Perfect size for small snips & cutting thread.,5
B07T64ZSD1,I would recommend these to anyone doing crafts. Very nice variety of colors. I also really like the texture. I use these over top of paint and the out has been wonderful!,5
B07T64ZSD1,"It's glitter! It's a lot of glitter! If that's what you are looking for, that's what you are going to get. Containers are not super secure, so glitter does escape and go places that you don't want it to go. I felt this was a good price for the amount of glitter I received and the variety of colors I received. Glitter! (Exiting this review with jazz hands and excitement for my fellow glitter enthusiasts!)",5
B07T64ZSD1,Using this product for first time and happy with it.  I use it in my epoxy work. Colors are very vibrant.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Pretty glitter, I bought this for nail art mostly, love the wide variety of different colors of glitter and the amount you get, I just hate how it comes in plastic little jars, they break so easily.",4
B07T64ZSD1,This glitter was very easy to clean up!,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Super small bottles, I thought they were going to be a little bigger but still great quality. A couple did spill out so there was glitter everywhere.  You get maybe 2 tablespoons of each color. Hope that helps.",5
B07T64ZSD1,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought these to mix with my acrylic and it was so good!!! I have also used it to do glitter frenchies and they are also goooddd!!! I am honestly obsessed and it comes with great (vibrant) colors!!No light colors like light blue, or light pink!! Recommend to buy separately pastel colors!!",5
B07T64ZSD1,This is my second order,5
B07T64ZSD1,Made a craft project.  It worked very well.  Nice variety of colors.  I would have preferred a sprinkle top with a cap.,4
B07T64ZSD1,Perfecto,5
B07T64ZSD1,Quality and fair price. Containers are smaller than how they appear in the picture though. Vials are shy of 2 inches tall and not thicker than like your index finger or so.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm pleased with the product and the colors are gorgeous.However I don't know if they were hastily packaged or some were not closed well, but in one of the packages I received, one of the vials had opened and glitter had spilled into the packaging. I had to clean each vial and the container carefully and thoroughly and thus I lost the contents of one vial.",4
B07T64ZSD1,Good variety of color.. only thing for me is the gold is everywhere maybe popped by accident durning shipping process wat ever the case is im happy with it,4
B07T64ZSD1,Beautiful colors and variety,5
B07T64ZSD1,Love all the assorted colors.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"I absolutely love the assortment of colors! They may be small but unless you are needing a lot of a certain color, they are a great value! I haven't used them yet but I am pleased with the amount and the colors.",5
B07T64ZSD1,This was a product I donated to an all-girls facility. They enjoyed the glitter to put on poster board and t-shirts to wear and hang on their walls.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Lots of glitter, lot of colors, lot's of sparkle! I'm happy.Be careful of spilling, it's extra fine glitter so it'll make a mess in carpets (not fun)",5
B07T64ZSD1,The only thing that was deceptive was the size of the bottles I thought was going to be bigger. However forgetting 32 colors it is a good value. And they work very well in my resin art. This product can be used for many different things and is extremely versatile.,4
B07T64ZSD1,"The amount of colors available in this Glitter set was amazing. My son loved how many glitter options were available for arts and craft times. Each color is sealed nicely in a small container, it came in a small square box full of individually bottled colors- very easy to store.",5
B07T64ZSD1,"I definitely like the right colors, but the containers were so small. You really had enough to do anything with Them",4
B07T64ZSD1,So many beautiful colors and super good quality for crafting!,5
B07T64ZSD1,Pretty colors !,5
B07T64ZSD1,Great product for school projects and homework,5
B07T64ZSD1,"I love that this comes in so many colors, shapes, and sizes!",4
B07T64ZSD1,"I like that the lids were east to get on and off without the spill being a fear. I mixed it with this gel, in these little twist cap containers. Now I have glitter hair gel for my kids!",5
B07T64ZSD1,Very shiny,5
B07T64ZSD1,Loved it and I mixed all of them together my girls lovesssss it,5
B07T64ZSD1,Todo me gusto mas brillante mas bonitos mis productos que elaboro,5
B07T64ZSD1,works well for me,5
B07T64ZSD1,Great for all projects,5
B07T64ZSD1,These were a lot smaller than I thought they were going to be. I use the glitter in resin and with how small these will only be able to use a couple of times.,4
B07T64ZSD1,Got this for my grand daughter. Is a great product.,5
B07T64ZSD1,These are so pretty!! Will buy again!!! But the orange was opened when I got it and my bed and myself and my cat are all sparkling now looks like a strip club but sooooooo pretty!!! I am trying to figure out how to get a refund for this or a replacement,4
B07T64ZSD1,,5
B07T64ZSD1,Lots of colors but the containers are very small. It worked for the purpose I needed them for. Good quality.,5

B07T64ZSD1,"Nice rainbow of colours. Would of preferred a little finer for what I was after, but over all, I would buy this again if the need arises.",4
B07T64ZSD1,"I make resin art, specifically dominoes and chess sets. This is a test dominoe I made to show result. It really came out beautiful.  The bright colors and variety is amazing. I do recommend for art projects.",5
B07T64ZSD1,"Great glitter pack, got it for the baseball team and used it as good luck on the bats and on top of eye black. Good quality and love the colors. (Good for slime as well)",5
B07T64ZSD1,"I love experimenting and trying new things to make my Kindness Rocks more fun and appealing. I wanted something other than just glitter paint, and this was exactly what I needed. Works great with my UV Resin. My only complaint is that I wish it came with a small scoop. I just ended up using a silicone one that came with my resin, but as you can imagine, the glitter sticks like crazy.Overall, I love the variety of colors. Even though the jars are somewhat small as others have pointed out, I think it will go a long way for my purposes.",4
B07T64ZSD1,Very fine glitter.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Use it on my hair and it looks so pretty , could be better if it stayed on longer",4
B07T64ZSD1,"I live these glitters!  They are simply gorgeous!  With spray adhesive or clear Elmer's glue,  you can add these glitters to nearly anything to get it to pop! I have bought the small variety to try. I loved them so much I bought the bigger jars to use on many projects.",5
B07T64ZSD1,Great for embossing my cards,5
B07T64ZSD1,Works great for my simple products! Love all the colors!,5
B07T64ZSD1,Loved each color and they looked amazing in each one of my plants.,5
B07T64ZSD1,Used it for making Sensory bottles for my granddaughter's Pre-K 3 class. It was great!!,5
B07T64ZSD1,Each container is small but a large variety of colors.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Different than the other reviewers, mine came in clear plastic container that had no room for the tops to come off in any way-then tightly bubble-wrapped. There was no way the tops were getting off the containers holding the glitter!Size is quite a bit smaller than I expected, but the size IS on the page to see. I had to use the full container of red into my bottle of red stain. I hope it's enough glitter for the job.Other than the size I love this. No stars removed.",5
B07T64ZSD1,"I purchased these for a project that my daughter is doing. There is a variety of colors and she loves the different holographic shapes. All girls love glitter! We will be using this for projects, crafts, and makeup!",5
B07T64ZSD1,Just what I was looking for,5
B07T64ZSD1,Love the variety of colors I labeled mine so I know what they are looking at the caps made it much easier but this glitter goes a long way,5
B07T64ZSD1,"My little sister started a lip gloss business and I bought these for her. They were a nice bright color, nice pigment, came fast and were made of good quality.",5
B07T64ZSD1,This glitter is very fine with bright colors.,5
B07T64ZSD1,Got this in the mail today and one of the green glitters broke. The containers are thin plastic and one completely snapped in the mail. It was a messThe rest of the glitter is fine.,2
B07T64ZSD1,"The item corresponds to the description, arrived undamaged. I liked it",5
B07T64ZSD1,This product was encased in bubble wrap and all bottles were intact when I opened the plastic box.  All bottles have the same amount of glitter. Haven't used it yet so gave a 4 star.,4
B07T64ZSD1,Colors are very bright and as shown in pictures!,5
B07T64ZSD1,"There are lots of different colors in this pack...but each pack is very small. I got these to use in my Sunday School classroom, and while the quality of the glitter is fine, I probably should have gotten fewer colors with larger individual portions. This would be fine for one child doing a project...but the result in the classroom is that there isn't enough of any one color to go around, so it's hard for multiple chilren to do the same project.",3
B07T64ZSD1,This glitter is awesome! I love sparkles :-),5
B07T64ZSD1,I ordered the product on Wednesday and was delivered by Thursday afternoon. The glitter was just what I needed for my table project.  .Thank you,5
B07T64ZSD1,just as described,5
B07T64ZSD1,I have recently started making different resin projects. I love how vibrant and beautiful the colors are! Mixes well and is easy to use.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I just made my first epoxy art, i will update this in 72 hours, when it's done, but these gliters are really pretty. I mostly used the chunky ones but I'll have uses for all of them, hopefully. Really no complaints but I may eventually be large bottles. A little does go along way but I do see me using my favorites quick.",5
B07T64ZSD1,"I got these to add sparkly pizzazz to my epoxy resin projects and i am very impressed. I love the variety of colors. I love the variety of sizes in the glitter, there's chunky sizes and finely grounded sizes.. The glitter EMBELLISHMENTS makes my resin projects POP!! Love this product and will be purchasing from this company in the future. PLUS the value for what YOU get is amazing.",5
B07T64ZSD1,"Fantastic range of colors, great amount to work with.. love it!",5
B07T64ZSD1,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The color options are great you have a mix between chunky glitter and fine glitter. But they are in very small containers. For small projects, it will get the job done.",4
B07T64ZSD1,I love the range of colors but they are smaller containers. To do one tumbler requires 1 entire container of glitter so these are great for starting and testing colors or for use in small resin projects! The glitter is nice though and works as expected!,4
B07T64ZSD1,Quick delivery. Package arrived in great condition. No damage and no spillage of glitter in the package. Small jars but I knew they would be. A little goes a long way. Great variety of colors. I would recommend this product and will buy again.,4
B07T64ZSD1,"Really impressed with this pack of fine glitter.  The variety of colors and sparkle are A+  The screw on lids are nice; they don't suddenly ""pop"" open when unscrewing them, potentially spilling glitter all over.",5
B07T64ZSD1,The colorfull,5
B07T64ZSD1,I bought this for an art project for my students. Very pleased with the amount and consistency of glitter included as well as the colors included.,5
B07T64ZSD1,Love all the different colors - good usable color shades.  A little bit goes a long ways.  These will last me years.  Using in making UV resin jewelry.,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Like the variety to choose from, quality is great. I just didn't expect them to be so small",5
B07T64ZSD1,very good glitter. I am satisfied 100 percent,5
B07T64ZSD1,I bought these to use in making snow globes with my grandchildren. They loved all the choices!,5
B07T64ZSD1,"Just remember glitter does go everywhere! Has upgraded cards easily and looks nice, can use small holes and shake a little bit out, or opening to use more. Put some on printed stationary for party, special birthday card etc. Haven't tried putting on wall yet for kids but maybe.",5
B07T64ZSD1,excellent,5
B07T64ZSD1,I love the fact that you only need a sprinkle to make your resin project sparkle.,5
B07T64ZSD1,This glitter is very pretty. It's easy to work with,5
B07T64ZSD1,Used it for resin letters with granddaughter and they went straight to the bottom. Little disappointed,2
B07T64ZSD1,The size of each bottle is extremely small,2
B07LFH2MGH,"We got this for DIY decor for our son's first birthday party. My wife did custom decor that she printed and needed a way trim a lot of papers at the same time. This worked beautifully. She said it was easy to use, cut well, and lightweight. It has a way to lock the blade when not in use. Overall, great paper cutter.",5
B07LFH2MGH,"This guillotine is so light and sharp. I was hesitant on getting a needed heavy clunky guillotine. I am so glad. i got this one. This is  so light you can easily pick it up and store anywhere. Great Value. Not an Old school guillotine. New and improved in my opinion. Hope holds up, it think it will. If on the fence on this. I hope this helps you.",5
B07LFH2MGH,"The blade is very sharp, easily cuts card stock,  and the cutter has good safety features. The top area where you hold the paper to get a straight cut is slanted so I haven't been able to get a straight cut without carefully shifting the paper. I guess that's to be expected when it's from China and inexpensive.",3
B07LFH2MGH,and is easy to store away. No-brainer purchase.,5
B07LFH2MGH,"This thing cuts paper and comic boards nicely. It can only do one board at time, however (I use it for custom-size comic boards). The thing I would watch out for here is: MAKE SURE you lower the arm completely after each cut. I forgot to on the 2nd day I had it and ran my thumb across the blade the long way. I bled for about 30 minutes, and it was one of those cuts that doesn't hurt until you look at it. I suppose that speaks to the sharpness of the blade. I would've given this 5 stars if it hadn't attacked me.",4
B07LFH2MGH,We order this one for our wedding menus and be able to cut th to the right size. It looked like it was going to work great but unfortunately the menus were in a different type of paper that need it professionally cut.  But this one seems to be a great tool for your basic home projects.,5
B07LFH2MGH,"Still cutting great!Handle is still tight and the blades remain very sharp!Be careful moving your fingers too close to these blades, they certainly will cut you.Great cutter!",5
B07LFH2MGH,"I bought this with the intention of cutting single sheets of photo paper.  For this review, I tested the cutter with a single sheet of regular old 8.5x11.  See the photos for how it did.4/5 serves my purpose.",4
B07LFH2MGH,I only have one thing so afraid to let husband use for the fear of him cutting his fingers off!,5
B07LFH2MGH,This won't break your bank and it does its job. I used it to cut off edges of sublimation paper before sublimating.,4
B07LFH2MGH,"This paper cutter (15"") is bigger than I thought it would be, even though I read the measurements listed in its description. At first I thought I'd return it, but then I started cutting some of my really large watercolor stock. WOW. It cuts through 140 lb watercolor cardstock like butter. It cuts delicate vellum with a clean smooth edge. I'm keeping it! I've got paper cutters that I've paid more than 3x what I paid for the 15"" Amazon Basics Guillotine Paper Cutter that never gave me as clean a cut. Now I'm thinking about buying the smaller Amazon Basics Paper Cutter, too. I do a lot of paper trimming for my crafts, and having a reliable cutter that can produce a clean edge to both heavy and delicate paper is a must for me. This brand does just that.",5
B07LFH2MGH,"We've had this paper shear awhile and it works well. But it can also bite. I needed to move it today and simply did what most folks would do, pick it up with one hand on each side. As soon as I reached under the right side the cutter sliced into my right index finger tip. This despite the fact that the blade was fully closed and locked. So be careful because the very sharp blade is exposed inside the base and there are no warning labels telling you not to reach underneath. I'm on blood thinners and even the slightest nick takes quite awhile to quite bleeding. That cut put me out of business for the rest of the day. Note: I've given it four stars because it works very well, but more than that I want prospective buyers to know they may need a bandage or two - I'm on my third.",4
B07LFH2MGH,"I knew this was a very inexpensive ""basic"" (aka all plastic except for the cutting bar) paper cutter, and I got this as it was the only 15"" paper cutter I could find at a reasonable price. Upon arrival, the shipping box had a 4"" tear in it exposing the cutter. Fortunately, no damage.  The plastic handle was attached to the cutting handle with a single screw, and it was ready for use. For my needs, this will work fine. But if you plan to use this in a 'busy' (aka office) environment, look for something sturdier. I can imagine the plastic will eventually break and I'll replace it with something more substantial. But for now, and for the price, this is a workable solution for me. I dock 2 stars at the build is rather 'basic', but what can you expect at this price point?",3
B07LFH2MGH,great value and can be use for a long time. trust this.,4
B07LFH2MGH,"I didn't expect much buying the very cheapest paper cutter I could get. It really only has one function; to cut paper, and it seems to do that just fine. I do, however, wish it had some way to line up the paper better. You don't really know where it will cut until you put the blade down onto the paper. I wish the clear plastic guide was 1/8th of an inch more to the right, then you could use that as a guide. Maybe if you don't need to make precise cuts (I'm cutting photos from my printer) it would work fine.",3
B07LFH2MGH,"We love this paper cutter at my job. Very easy to put together. Cuts clean, straight lines.",5
B07LFH2MGH,Purchased to cut bags for a vacuum sealer. Does the job,5
B07LFH2MGH,This is fine except I failed to notice that there was no ruler at the top of the platform. There's only one a little less than halfway down the platform. I've had a few cutters because I make greeting cards and I've never seen one without a ruler at the top. This is definitely not very handy.,4
B07LFH2MGH,"If you have low expectations as I did, you will be satisfied with this paper trimmer. I am using it for single sheet cotton watercolor paper, and not too frequently. I don't think it will handle multiple sheets of paper, nor last long under repeated use. But, for my limited needs, the trimmer will work fine. If it wasn't for the low price for this 15 inch trimmer, I would have rated it lower. But I know you get what you pay for.",4
B07LFH2MGH,"This feels like it was made in a 3-D printer. It has very cheap construction and is super basic. The handle does not have a lock. It does the job, but I'm afraid I'll break it every time I use it.",3
B07LFH2MGH,Arrived without the handle but decided to keep because I can still use it.,3
B07LFH2MGH,Bigger than expected I love it very sharp be careful when using,5
B07LFH2MGH,Muy buena gillotina  liviana pero fuerte y precisa,5
B07LFH2MGH,"It looks good and it cuts well, but the screw to hold the handle on is missing",4
B07LFH2MGH,This does the job of cutting 10 or so sheets of standard paper fine but it is extremely lightweight which makes it a little bit annoying to work with since you have to sort of hold it down all the time. Other than that the blade is sharp and it works great for what we needed it for.,4
B07LFH2MGH,"Makes nice sharp cuts - I haven't had issues with it trying to eat the paper. It has a nice function where there is a clear plastic rim against the blade, which you can press down on to keep the paper from shifting while making the cut. I've tried up to 4 sheets of paper without any problem, manual says up to 10. I also didn't realize how light it would be - the frame is made of plastic but this doesn't seem like it'll be an issue. It's still relatively new but I'll update this review if I encounter any problems. (Aug 2024)",5
B07LFH2MGH,"This is perfect for what I need in my workshop, .it is lightweight and easy to move around and it's even sharp enough to cut leather,  which is what I wanted.It has a safety guard which is supposed to keep your fingers from getting close to the blade which is nice.  But it really gets in the way so I removed it.  Don't tell anyone!",5
B07LFH2MGH,Works good for small stacks of paper. Blade is sharp as hell. I accidentally bumped my knuckle up against the blade when it was raised and it sliced me almost to the bone.,5
B07LFH2MGH,I have only used this cutter a few times but I was impressed with the clean cut and straight lines. I was using scissors. This is so much easier. I was making viewfinders for a drawing class.,5
B07LFH2MGH,"As a classroom teacher, this comes in so handy. Cuts very nicely.  Great value for the price.",5
B07LFH2MGH,"It almost cuts straight, does that count.  I'm a paper crafter and I need straight cuts but I have yet to find any paper cutter/trimmer that cuts perfectly straight.  And don't tell me Fiskars because that company is some of the worst offenders in selling trimmers that don't cut straight.  I prefer guillotine trimmers over blade because I feel they are more accurate.  However, this one still cuts a little off, not bad but still not straight.  Also, the entire thing is black even the measurement markers are the same color as the rest of the trimmer.  I had to use a silver sharpie marker to color the numbers so I could see them clearly.  The half inch grid pattern that comprises the flat surface where you lay the paper is also confusing.  It should never have had indentions, it should just have had lines.  All that being said, it's super sharp and it does a pretty decent job.  I'll use it until I think I've found something better, which will probably be a long time.",4
B07LFH2MGH,"It's ok--just adequate for the job. If it's important to you to have extremely professional cuts, buy something better.",3
B07LFH2MGH,"Overall this is a good product for the price, but my main issue is that it is very difficult to get precise especially if you do a stack of papers. For me they always slideeven when I press down the tab that is supposed to help.However, I have found other uses. I can use the surface as part of my work station for folding flyers or for gluing pieces.Not the best and not the worst... it is a decent paper cutter. Just not for more than about 4 sheets at a time. I got it to trim a border off of things I printed. I find myself reverting to the sisscors all the time. Maybe if I just had to cut things in half non precisely, it wouldn't matter so much.",5
B07LFH2MGH,"I bought this because I needed something smaller than the one I have.  this one is 12 x 12"".It doesn't cut a straight line, so its fairly useless for anything professional or important.I'll keep it foer cutting paper, but cannot use for my photos.",3
B07LFH2MGH,"I love this paper cutter! It's very light but has powerful blade mechanism.As with anything sharp, we had to find a ""safe"" spot for it!",5
B07LFH2MGH,too small for job returned,5
B00006IBK9,Works perfectly,5
B00006IBK9,Spring rattles because it's loose and won't cut paper.  Very low quality and thin metal.  Scared to use.  Not returnable.  Buyer beware.,5
B00006IBK9,"We bought this little single hole puncher mainly for punching, well, single holes! I've used mainly to punch the mounting holes for my homemade Mountain Bike mudguards/fenders, as these are the easiest and most versatile option (you could use a drill but there's more chance of it going wrong). BTW those mudguards were made out of thin plastic sheets, basically binder divider sheets. I like how these have a little ""storage"" flap at the bottom, which will retain all the little bits of holes you've punched out. Every handful of uses, you'll probably want to dump the the stuff out so it won't get clogged in there. It will also punch though thin cardboard, like TP rolls.I do wish these punchers had a foam or rubber slide-on grip covers, as after repeated punching, especially through thicker materials, your palms will hurt a little bit. Also, I do wish that this puncher had a little, sharp raised ""lip"", how these single hole punchers work is there's a flat, completely dull little metal disk that just uses brute force to punch through the material. If it had raised, sharp edges around the disk it'd be easier to punch stuff.However, all single hole punchers I've seen all ""suffer"" from these two ""drawbacks"", so take that as you will! Overall, solid puncher, oh, and it punches decently clean holes (some other reviewers say it punches really badly), you will probably need to clean up the edges a little if you're picky about the holes, but nothing major. And I almost forgot, I've had this puncher for over a year now, I use it maybe once or twice every month now.If you found this helpful, click the little ""helpful"" button below this review so others will see this review!",4
B00006IBK9,Happy with purchase,5
B00006IBK9,Nice holes,5
B00006IBK9,This single hole puncher is a must for all your work that needs the single hole puncher. Easy to use and has a great quality.,5
B00006IBK9,"I choose the simple low cost puncher but didn't work as easy on plastic. Did the job but took more time and effort. Says 5 pages at a time, but 2 tops worked best.",4
B00006IBK9,THIS WORKS GREAT AND ITS NICE THAT IT CATCHES WHAT YOU PUNCH. YOU'LL LOVE IT.,5
B00006IBK9,This was a gift for a new teacher. This brand is the one to buy.,5
B00006IBK9,Worst hole punch I have ever used.  Even on a single sheet of paper it does not cleanly punch a hole.  The partially punched out paper is left attached on one side.  Several times just punching a single sheet it has stuck shut and would not open.  Possibly it is not aligned to hit in the right spot.  It seems to hit on the top part before it ties to punch the hole.  I would not recommend anyone purchase this.  If I am close to a return center within the 30 days it's going back.Edited.  The company sent me another punch.  It works much better and completely punches the hole out.  So obviously the first one was defective.  Good customer service.,4
B00006IBK9,"I was hoping that a product manufactured by Swingline would have been pretty close to perfect but not in this case.  The item does punch hole but the jaws and misaligned slightly such that the punch gets hung up in the hole so that the handles do not return to ""home position"" without manual intervention.I will return this one and see if a replacement works better.",2
B00006IBK9,Does what I needed it to do: punch holes! A little rough on the hands (I have mild carpal tunnel) but not bad if you are only punching a few items at a time.,4
B00006IBK9,Great,5
B00006IBK9,My son liked it,5
B00006IBK9,Cool Tool,4
B00006IBK9,"I bought this to punch holes in my daughter's award ribbons, so we could keep them on a metal ring as she collects them. The ribbons are a fabric/satin-like material, not super thin, and this hole punch was able to punch through multiple with ease. No snagging, clean cuts. Worked perfectly for what we bought it for!",5
B00006IBK9,"Panda grow bags do not come with adequate drainage holes, so I have to add more. Put on a movie, get a bag for discards, and bring up a pack of panda grow bags with this hole puncher? Make an event after it if you're going through a few hundred with a group. This is a good hole puncher.",5
B00006IBK9,"Good quality.  Produces sharp, crisp punches.  Easy to align for punches so you get it right easily!",5
B00006IBK9,Lightly built and chintzy.  The two halves of the punch align poorly.  I expected this brand to live up to its legacy.  It does not.,3
B00006IBK9,These feel really cheap and light. Not like the old kind from swingline. Good for one or two pages but I don't expect them to last for long.,3
B00006IBK9,Works as described. Would buy again and recommend to a friend.,5
B00006IBK9,"I bought this particular punch based on the reputation of the Swingline name. Alas, like so many other brands, Swingline has lost its way by sacrificing quality for cheap labor.  The punch has only one job - to punch a clean hole through paper/cardstock.  And it is incapable of doing so.  I would estimate it punches properly about 1 out of 5 times on average.  The rest of the time, it jams in the hole, leaves an area of the punched hole looking like it was torn, not cut, or just doesn't cut at all.  I tried on this paper, lightweight cardstock and heavier cardstock.  It made no difference.My 3-star rating is a gift.  I would not recommend.",3
B00006IBK9,"This was the best price for a well known company.  I like how sturdy it is and it cuts through the paper super easy too.  Also, there are no little holes falling out all over like the cheap hole punches do.  I am pleased.",5
B00006IBK9,"After reading so many negative reviews I was unsure about ordering this hole punch, but I needed to get a cheap hole punch quickly and could get this one delivered the next day. As soon as it arrived I used it to punch a bunch of holes through folded over brown paper bags (at least 8 layers of paper bag for each punch) and it worked great! After punching holes in a few bags I noticed that it became harder to punch so I emptied the small compartment on the head of the hole punch that held all the circles that were punched off. It worked just like new afterward, so I suspect the people that had difficulty punching after some time were probably not emptying this tiny compartment. I've used it a few times since then and it has worked great every time. It also definitely meets my expectations as a teacher, even though I am not using it in my classroom. I am 100% pleased with my purchase and would recommend this hole punch without reservation!",5
B00006IBK9,Just as advertised and very good quality,5
B00006IBK9,"Bought to help punch holes into the fruit fly pads so I could cut them in half. Cutting the pads was a little tricky, but at first the hule punch did not work as expected. After once done then the worked great. Tried to save money on the pads that I bought",4
B00006IBK9,Good price. Feels substantial. Works as advertised.,5
B00006IBK9,"Its very light in weight and handy, only thing the paper gets stuck to the puncher once punched and sometimes not easy to  pull out puncher without ripping the hole it just punched hence giving 4 stars.",5
B00006IBK9,"Swingline is my favorite brand of stapler (nothing beats a good metal Swingline stapler!), and I was pleased to see that they also make hole punchers.  I have a seven-ring dayplanner to which I often want to add papers, so I purchased this chrome one-hole punch.  I've been using it regularly for several months, and the punch is sturdy and well-made.  The punch pushes the paper dot into a small metal trap that needs to be emptied after a few uses; it's nice not to have refuse all over my desk after each use.  There's also a small metal loop on the handle so that the punch can be hung up if desired.  I usually only punch a few sheets at a time, but it can handle up to five sheets, although you have to squeeze it fairly hard at that point.  It can also be used to make confetti!Note: The product description here indicates that it includes a ""paper clip holder.""  That should be ""paper chip holder"" - referring to the metal trap that catches the paper dots.",5
B00006IBK9,"We needed a hole punch for a few tags for an event, so we got the cheapest hole punch we could find.  It's Swingline, so we figured it would be pretty good, but it doesn't live up to the brand reputation.  The ""punch"" doesn't quite align with the ""hole"", so it takes a few tries to actually punch the hole.  It'll probably go straight into the trash as soon as we're done with this event.",3
B00006IBK9,"It's a hole puncher, does exactly what it is  intended for.",5
B00006IBK9,"Hole punch worked for 2-3 punches and then no longer aligned to allow punching. Sides of punch, handle very rough/sharp in spots.  Item not returnable. Waste of money. Delivered on time =1 star",1
B00006IBK9,"I mean, it does what it's supposed to do. It's really cool.",5
B00006IBK9,Item was as described. In the right time Frame.Thank you.,5
B00006IBK9,"i dont know man. its a hole puncher. it works good! Nothing bad with it, no bad comments.Works through thick paper and thin plastic as well! Sturdy.",5
B00006IBK9,"Admittedly I was doing a slightly unusual use case, trying to punch through some thin plastic sheets in sets of 2. I had to do a 2-hand grip and really squeeze, and then I pretty universally had one side hang on so it had to be pulled off by hand. Not a big worry, but the hole punch isn't as sharp as it could be. It works okay, especially for paper, but it's only okay.",4
B00006IBK9,"It punches, but where it falls down is after the punch is made....the ""punch part"" gets stuck in the back piece or punch receptacle or what ever you call it....very annoying having to pry the jaws apart.I guess for $2.99 you get what you pay for.I'm going to buy a better unit from a different manufacturer.",3
B00006IBK9,This hole punch is good for a few pieces of paper or a paper plate which is what I needed it for. Holds up well. Exactly like described.,5
B00006IBK9,Always need a hole punch for my office.  Great quality,5
B00006IBK9,A good paper punch that gets the job done.,5

B00006IBK9,This product is defective and it wont let me do a return.  So i have to replace it but will not be ordering from same seller for sure.,1
B00006IBK9,Now after a few weeks of using this it doesn't always punch well.  I had started off with a 5star rating and have dropped it to 4.  If it gets even worse I'll drop it down to 3.  It should last more than a couple of weeks making less than 20 punches a day in my opinion,4
B00006IBK9,"Have used it a grand total of 6 times so far, but it worked well for those 6 holes I needed to punch!",5
B00006IBK9,Couldn't believe that I had to order a single hole punch from Amazon; couldn't find one in Wal Mart. Works fine.,5
B00006IBK9,"I have found this hole punch to work exactly as promised.  I am writing this more to share my purpose for use, as I love to learn ideas and uses (that I never thought of) for things I use through reviews.  We travel quite a bit, and often with my parents, so there are many room keys floating around, and we're usually sharing one by the end of the week.  Our old strategy was to write names on them with a sharpie, but that doesn't prevent them from being lost.  Soooo - I now keep this with my travel stuff and punch a hole in each room key/card and attach a lanyard (the plain black ones don't cost much at all).  The string alone tends to help not lose it, but when the family can put it around their neck or attach other stuff, they are rarely lost.",5
B00006IBK9,I bought this to do crafts with my grandchild and it was impossible for her to use.  Adults would likely not have as much difficulty but it is difficult to see where the hole is being placed.,3
B00006IBK9,"This item works as expected.It is a good quality single hole punch.It can cut through multiple pages, maybe 5-7 max.The paper that was cut is stored in a little bin on the handle that has to be emptied.",5
B00006IBK9,"Can't say much about a hole puncher, can you? It was a good name brand for cheap, and it punched holes.",5
B00006IBK9,"I purchased this Swingline hole punch to replace a very old Swingline hole punch. I also bought the Bostich hole punch at the same time. The old Swingline did not punch through the thin plastic previously used to produce overhead transparencies. The new Swingline didn't do it either, although the Bostich did. This Swingline is good for paper, but that's it.",4
B00006IBK9,"I really liked that the holes her very circular. By that, I mean the holes were very round and not square or rectangular.",4
B00006IBK9,I can make confetti or holes in paper. Have your kids make a bunch of holes and make confetti for fiesta?,5
B00006IBK9,Single hole punch and works great. Does exactly what it is supposed to.,5
B00006IBK9,"My seven year old daughter kept making off with my Crop-a-Dile hole punch so I decided to get her a smaller, easier one of her own. She's basically just using this to punch holes in single sheets of paper- everything from run of the mill notebook paper and thicker patterned and construction papers and cardstock. It works fine- even though it's very ""no frills"", it makes a clean punch with a good squeeze. She doesn't like that the handles are so ""slippery"" but she's able to operate it with no problem. It's certainly easier for kids to use than the Crop-A-Dile.",4
B00006IBK9,Works like it should.,5
B00006IBK9,"Well I never thought I would be reviewing a hole punch but here it goes. I bought these to pop holes in zip-lock bags for retail hangers. The bags I was punching were pretty thin and after about 8 of them the narrow rounded handle started pushing into the pressure point on my palm pretty bad. Nothing crazy but a mild inconvenience which makes me realize why they have padded handled models. After a while (roughly 20 punches) the punch wouldn't retract after being depressed and had to be pried open to be used again.Upside was Amazon was super good about getting a replacement out ASAP, threw the other one away. Honestly if you are looking for punching more than a couple holes I would step up to a better product for longevity and comfort.",3
B00006IBK9,"I had a couple of swingline products from years ago that were okay, so I bought this without reading the reviews.  The cardboard packaging was already torn, so it must be ancient stock or somebody else's return.I didn't open the package, but I could tell just by looking that it is a piece of junk.  Amazon won't permit a return, probably because they would receive so many.",1
B00006IBK9,"I'm an high school student and I needed a cheap hole punch to sort my binders. This was the cheapest I found and actually helped me a lot in having a successful school year by staying organized.I recommend if you only have some papers a day to punch - otherwise, you'd better find a complete version (doing all the 3 holes at the same time) which would be way more efficient.",4
B00006IBK9,"If you're punching paper, this works great. Not so much on plastic. It tends to stick when punching plastic, making it hard to open the punch again.",5
B00006IBK9,I got this purely to punch holes in shrinky dinks. It does the job.,5
B00006IBK9,Works as intended. Great for standard paper but works well for card stock as well. I was able to punch 3 card stocks ay a time. A little uncomfortable due to the thickness of the material and lack of grip on the punch but worked as expected.,4
B00006IBK9,Just a simple single hole punch that works fine and is very sturdy.,5
B00006IBK9,It's a paper punch. Anyone would assume it makes holes in paper.,5
B00006IBK9,Not much to say except it does what we need!,5
B00006IBK9,"Nothing exquisite, it does what a whole puncher does.",5
B00006IBK9,I recently bought this 2 pack for the office as we did not have one. I have one of these at home that we've had for at least 30 years and it is as good as new. I'd never choose another brand.,5
B00006IBK9,Works OK but not the same quality as the same brand/model I used as a child,4
B00006IBK9,"I purchased this hole punch as an add on item for $2.35.  When I first started using it, I couldn't figure out where the punched out paper was falling and kept thinking I was going to have a mess to clean up when done with all my hole punching.  I finally noticed that it has a little storage area that holds the punched out paper to prevent it from falling all over the place.  Nice feature!The hole punch is sharp and works well.  It's good quality and is a great value for the price.",5
B00006IBK9,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Used as a paper punch. It got stuck and when I tried to unstick it, the spring came out. I tried to put the spring back in and the metal guide fell off too.",5
B00006IBK9,For its price this hole punch is ok. The bottom part where the punch bits go started to hang open after 1 use. The little bits fallout and go on the floor.The hole puncher works great other than the pits collector.,3
B00006IBK9,I bought these for punching holes in shrink-paper before baking so I could make Christmas tree ornaments. They've worked well for that so far.,5
B00006IBK9,These can be hard on the hands after a little while. There is nothing covering the metal grips and you have to squeeze hard to get these to cut. So after I used these for more than a few holes at a time they hurt my hands a little.,4
B00006IBK9,What can I say?  It punches holes in paper.,4
B00006IBK9,Make sure you get this to help with cleaning up paper holes that get punched out,5
B00006IBK9,"It works well. Probably not ergonomic enough to use for hours punching through thousands of sheets of paper. But if that's your game, you should invest in something more substantial.",4
B00006IBK9,very good,5
B00006IBK9,The product definitely does the job of punching holes but it caused me pain in my hands due to how stiff the punching machine was. I used it to punch holes in laminated sheets and had red sore palms by the time I finished. It has a little space to collect the paper or material after punching holes which is a good idea but it needs to be cleaned frequently to let the puncher do it's job,3
B00006IBK9,Easy to use and very sturdy ... need to punch holes in Relay for Life cards to run ribbon through and attach to Torch.,5
B00006IBK9,I ordered two paper punches same type and brand. The first one I tried the spring would not pull back and was difficult to work with on regular paper. The second one worked fine for crafting and will cut 3 to 4 pieces of computer paper at a time. When I try to return it via Amazon they said I had to go to the manufacture and provided the phone number.,3
B00006IBK9,"I had some paper that did not have holes and I needed to make holes in this paper. After a quick amazon search, I found a device made specifically for this purpose. Thrilled about the discovery, I purchased this 'hole puncher'. The device was delivered a prompt and I'm happy to report that my previously hole-less paper now has holes. 5 stars. I highly recommend for modifying paper.",5
B00006IBK9,"I was punching holes though several layers of poster board, and it worked great! The tool has a tiny holder on it to collect the pieces that come out. It is super easy to use, and I have arthritis in my hands. It is well made and very good.",5
B00006IBK9,the fabric whole puncher tool actually works,3
B08M5DX18J,"I recently purchased the Scissors All Purpose 3 Pack, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations, earning a well-deserved 5-star rating from me. These scissors have become an indispensable tool in both my home and office.Firstly, the sharpness of the blades is remarkable. Whether I'm cutting through paper, fabric, or even tougher materials, these scissors handle it with ease. The precision and clean cuts they provide have made all my cutting tasks much simpler and more efficient.The ergonomic design is another standout feature. They are incredibly comfortable to hold, reducing hand fatigue, which is a significant factor for me as I often use scissors for extended periods. The grip is designed to fit comfortably in the hand, providing excellent control and stability during use.Durability is also a key strength of these scissors. They feel solid and well-constructed, and I've noticed no signs of wear and tear despite frequent use. This durability assures me that they will be a lasting addition to my toolkit.Additionally, the variety in the 3-pack is very useful. Each pair of scissors seems to be tailored for different types of tasks, making the pack versatile and practical for a range of needs. Whether in the kitchen, office, or for crafting, each pair has proven to be useful in its own way.The value for money with this pack is outstanding. High-quality scissors can often be quite pricey, but this pack provides professional-grade quality at a very reasonable price point.",5

B08M5DX18J,I am using these for paper and they are very sharp and work well,5
B08M5DX18J,"Worth the price, they feel more expensive than what I paid. They cut with ease, and fit firm in your hands.",5
B08M5DX18J,"Bought this three pack to have for Christmas wrapping. They are sharp and provide that nice glide when slicing the wrapping paper. I was actually cutting a piece of twine and they are so quick and smooth that I was unable to move my finger in time and it lopped off a piece of my finger tip. No joke. It's now almost a week after and I'm still bandaged. These scissors are so sharp and smooth, I would definitely buy again. I'll just keep my fingers out of their pathway. And we now have a funny Christmas Story about the pretty purple scissors that cut off mom's fingertip.",5
B08M5DX18J,Very pleased. Nice colors and comfortable to hold. Amazing price !!!,5
B08M5DX18J,"I buy scissors in bulk !My husband and I somehow both misplace them continuously .This pack is a great value for the money and I will be purchasing again ,when my husband wanders off with my scissors .Durability is great I still have 2 pair hidden !!Easy to use great grip and design",5

B08M5DX18J,Very sharp cut great,5
B08M5DX18J,"I do sublimation and I cut lots and lots of paper.  I always need good scissors.  I am extremely organized with my craft stuff and my family knows that.  They take whatever scissors I have in my holder to cut anything they need...hair, food packages, Amazon packages, you know the drill.  Well, I bought this 3 pack so I can put one out and have some to spare.  They are quality scissors that I think will last a long time, but since I never really get them back once someone takes them out of my craft room, I can't tell you for sure.",5
B08M5DX18J,Very sharp and gets the job done,5
B08M5DX18J,Much better than the dollar tree scissors.  These are the real deal.,5
B08M5DX18J,"I use these for paper craft, sewing and have a pair in my kitchen.  Would buy again.",5
B08M5DX18J,utiles y se ven finas,5
B08M5DX18J,Great scissors. I was looking for super sharp scissors that can cut through anything I could throw at them and these fit the bill. They have stayed sharp and the screw holding them together has stayed tight. These are not the usual flimsy scissors you would get at this price point.,5
B08M5DX18J,"Ordered a 3 pack, liked them so much ordered more. Love having scissors at hand when needed. Color coded ease of use for gardening, kitchen, etc.",5
B08M5DX18J,"I just got these yesterday, and so far so good. I really like the comfort of the handle when you hold them and they are nice and sharp. I like to dishwasher my Scissors, so I'm hoping they hold up well.",5

B08M5DX18J,I was tired of scissors that didn't cut when I needed them to. I ordered these and have been delighted with them. Three pairs definitely helps when I have two work areas and multiple uses for them. I will order them again.,5
B08M5DX18J,"I ordered these for move in day at a new house, we have used them for everything! Sharp, solid construction, good grip!",5
B08M5DX18J,I was unsure about these as they look big and bulky but I love them.  Easy to handle and cut well.,5

B08M5DX18J,Nice scissors for kitchen and basic around the house,5
B08M5DX18J,"I like to have scissors in several places so bought this set for my ""back up"" scissors. I keep a pair in the garage, one in the kitchen ""junk drawer"" and one upstairs. None get a lot of use but they are handy and have held up well, I've had them over a year.",5
B08M5DX18J,"Very sharp. Different variety of color if you like to assign each color for a different task such as yellow for crafts, orange for trimming the cats fur ball carefully, etc",5
B08M5DX18J,Produc used for crafting,5
B08M5DX18J,Whoa! These were way better than I was imagining. Super sharp. Very good craft scissors. Cut through felt and craft glue with no efforts. Very pleased with the purchase especially the price for 3 of them!,5

B08M5DX18J,These scissors are awesome. They cut like a dream!,5
B08M5DX18J,Good to have around the houseExcellent price,5
B08M5DX18J,These are simple scissors but extremely effective in the kitchen. I have been using them for a few months now and they are still sharp and crisp. I regularly use them in the dish washer on high heat and they haven't worn out a bit. I use them to cut flower stems and its easy peasy even for the thicker stems. the only reason I bought them because there was some deal on prime day and all I needed was simple basic scissors for cutting plastic food packages like rice/beans/cookies etc. They are now serving that purpose and more. I am deeply satisfied with this product!!,5
B08M5DX18J,I like the colors because they are easy to find when I set them down and they are sharp.,5
B08M5DX18J,"Repeat purchase because they work!  I use them at home and at the non-profit we run.  Unfortunately they manage to disappear as others use them and don't put them back in the holder I keep them in....so I keep buying more as the need arises and this is a brand that I know I can trust to be able to cut open puffy Amazon envelopes or other paper packaging materials.  Plus, they are pretty and have a variety of color choices.",5
B08M5DX18J,I ordered these as I didn't have enough scissors for an art class I was teaching. They arrived in time and I was impressed with their sturdiness.  They feel solid and are comfortable to hold.  They cut great and the bright colors just add another layer of happy vibe to the art room!,5
B08M5DX18J,Sharp and good price,4
B08M5DX18J,"I am amazed at the quality of this qmvess 3-pack of scissors, so used to the low-priced 3-packs being $store quality and not staying sharp for long.  I could tell right away by the weight and design these were higher quality.  they cut fabric wonderfully, even sheers and  slinky knits - seem to be on a par or even better than the well-known brand names.  they also do an excellent job as kitchen shears, cutting thru meat and chicken with ease.  am so glad I grabbed these on amazon day, highly recommend!edit - 9 months later these scissors are still cutting wonderfully and are still at a good price. have purchased 4 more sets for gifts - am that impressed!",5
B08M5DX18J,"These scissors are a good weight, not too light and not too heavy!  They are sharp and cut very well!",5
B08M5DX18J,Nice & sharp.,4
B08M5DX18J,"I had been waiting for sissors for a bit now.  Not sure what the delay was about.  I didn't want to hassel with returning them to get a ""fresh"" package.  The package was torn open, and the first pair, the orange ones, were defective a little.  They were a bit uneven when you moved the blades, and it caused resistance which was not comfortable to feel in your hand.  I would have returned them, too.  I opened the package the rest of the way, and the pink and green pair were both fine and in good order.  It was evident they likely had not been removed by the previous recipient.  I do like the pink and green ones, and I didn't REALLY want the orange pair anyway....had planned to give them to the husband or something.  I don't feel the vendor was super professional by allowing an opened, defective return be shipped to a new customer.  Not impressed.",3
B08M5DX18J,These cut through anything without any effort. Three pack was a bonus as I keep a pair in the car and  two at the ready in the house.,5
B08M5DX18J,Cuts fabric great,4
B08M5DX18J,They're scissors. It's a 3 pack. They're cute and efficiently cut things so I'm happy!,5

B08M5DX18J,Was cutting up an old old t-shirt for rags and all the scissors I had weren't up to the task bought this set and made short work of it they worked flawlessly,5
B08M5DX18J,Nice weight.  They cut true and sharp whether you are cutting from the tip or the base.  Really pleasantly surprised and very happy to finally find some decent scissors that don't cost a fortune !,5
B08M5DX18J,"These scissors are sharp and. I have 1 in the kitchen, living room, and bedroom. I will always have scissors available.",5
B08M5DX18J,They last long for cheap scissors. I bought a second set recently.,5
B08M5DX18J,"These super sharp scissors are awesome. Not clunky, just perfect. Thank you!",5
B08M5DX18J,"These are nice scissors, BUT watch out for Broken Screw Covers, I had two that was broke. The big thing was, I couldn't see sending them back for two broken covers.",4
B08M5DX18J,Good sharp scissors.  Can't comment on how well they hold up since I have only had them a short time.,5
B08M5DX18J,This is a great value for sissors you can use all over the house!,5
B08M5DX18J,These are cheap in price but super sharp and sturdy,5
B08M5DX18J,Excellent sharp full sized scissors. I used for cutting thin fabric. No issues at all. Seem very sharp,5
B003W0PBR2,"You can always count on Crayola for quality, and this construction paper proves that! Some off-brand construction paper does not have the sturdy weight of this paper, and the always-vibrant Crayola colors have been the best of the best for decades - you can't go wrong!My 4-year old granddaughter LOVES arts and crafts, so this construction paper was a must, along with some Crayola craft scissors - she is a happy little girl, indeed!",5
B003W0PBR2,Great quality construction paper that is a great value to purchase for a kid who loves to create art.,5
B003W0PBR2,Nice price for name brand paper. Will buy again.,5
B003W0PBR2,"As a homeschooling family, we fly through paper! This has been wonderful to have on hand for those projects & activities all through our home life and school year! Wonderful colors, great quantity for the price!",5
B003W0PBR2,Granddaughter loves her arts and crafts.,4
B003W0PBR2,"I bought these brightly colored construction pages, along with colored file folders, to help provide cognitive stimulation for my mom who has dementia. She always loved working with her paperwork and organizing things, so this was an easy solution to have her match the colored construction pages with to the same color of file folder. It's been a great, simple task for her to complete on our weekly visits, and she feels a sense of accomplishment when she is done!",5
B003W0PBR2,Class project of Christmas cards for first responders.,5
B003W0PBR2,I bought this for my daughter's homeschooling projects. This construction paper is of good quality. You can't go wrong with Crayola branded products. The count of 96 pages will last me for a while before needing to buy more. I highly recommend!,5
B003W0PBR2,I was a little disappointed at how thin the paper was and how faded the colors were,5
B003W0PBR2,"Color is great, works well, ease for my son to use and the paper is thick",4
B003W0PBR2,I purchased this to do a couple of crafty things around Halloween. The paper is good. Worked well for what I needed.,5
B003W0PBR2,"Can't go wrong with crayola anything. My kids love it, its sturdy and good quality for all sorts of crafts.",5
B003W0PBR2,As a homeschool mom construction paper is a staple for countless projects. We use it all the time. It has a good variety of colors. The weight is just right to fold and cut. We never go without having this construction paper in our school cabinet.,5
B003W0PBR2,Not too thick not too thin and good amount,5
B003W0PBR2,It is great and it contains a lot of colors but when making cards with it and A4 size paper the size is not the same and I have to add another layer of paper,5
B003W0PBR2,Love that this product is great for toddlers practicing fine motor skills,5
B003W0PBR2,"Wasn't sure what the quality would be,  but it was perfect for my work project. Will reorder in the future.",5
B003W0PBR2,THe construction paper is of good quality.  Package was delivered in good shape and in a timely manner.,5
B003W0PBR2,very happy with the color selection and sturdiness of the paper!,5
B003W0PBR2,Love the quantity/variety for the price!,5
B003W0PBR2,"Not the construction paper I grew up with. It was a tad thicker than copy paper. Colors were vivid, just expected a sturdier paper.",3
B003W0PBR2,This is a great deal and a great product . We use this pack about twice a year and it never disappoints.,5
B003W0PBR2,Very disappointed in Crayola & the quality of this construction paper. Colors are not bright & paper is very flimsy. Go with the Pacon brand. I bought 2 packages of that brand of different colors & they are WAY better for the money!,2
B003W0PBR2,I was expecting high end quality from the brand Crayola!No even close. I ordered 2 pks.Colors of the paper very dull. The weight very flimsy.Too late to return the second pk.The fact that I used the paper to make 100 color chartsin 1x1 squares was ok but the colors look faded.I will NOT order again. Save your money!!!,2
B003W0PBR2,"Awesome colors and sturdy!Best construction paper for all projects! Crayola in my opinion, produces the most vivid colors and high quality construction paper around! I have purchased knock off brands that are very flimsy and the colors are not very bright. This construction paper is durable for about anything kids can create! The colors do not fade unless they are subjected to a lot of sunlight. Great for kids to cut, paste and create!",5
B003W0PBR2,Great value and great for small crafts but if you want bolder colors I'd recommend buying colored cardstock paper instead which is also much thicker. But I didn't want thick with this and it's not described as such so nothing about it is misleading. Good quality and I made some silly random cards with it. Markers do bleed through easily so I recommend using small ballpoint pens or colored pencils instead.,5
B003W0PBR2,The paper is thick enough and good quality.,5
B003W0PBR2,Had lot's of fun,5
B003W0PBR2,"I highly recommend it for any class, no matter the grade or the subject that you teach.  It can be used for projects, for picture frames, etc.",5
B003W0PBR2,Not like they used to make construction paper.  Thin and flimsy.,3
B003W0PBR2,I bought this when the price was super low and I am happy that I did. My son likes the different colors for drawing his picture and the pages are very large.,5
B003W0PBR2,Lasts a long time and very bright colors! Love the crafts we can create with this paper!,5
B003W0PBR2,Came quickly for a project ny wife was working. The only observation is the paper is thinner than others we have ordered.,4
B003W0PBR2,"I thought I knew my way around the construction world. But then my kid showed me this product - I had no idea what a staple this could be! Kids are thrilled with it, great price, awesome value. Definitely a win.",5
B003W0PBR2,"I am not sure how they profit from this but it is insanely cheap for 96 sheets ($2-$3) especially since it is also free shipping. As for the product itself, it came well packaged with a good variety of colors.",5
B003W0PBR2,"Great quality paper, but I wish it included white.",4
B003W0PBR2,"It's more dull in color and lightweight than I had hoped, but the children love it so it's a win in the end.",4
B003W0PBR2,Good product,5
B003W0PBR2,"My girls love construction paper for drawing or making crafts and for $3, 96 sheets is good bargain. You get a wide variety of colors, but the paper is thinner than it used to be.",4
B003W0PBR2,"Very suitable for children's drawing, can also be used as hand origami.",4
B003W0PBR2,Bought it for my daughter as she likes to do a lot of craft work. She loves it. Will buy again once the current stock is over.,5
B003W0PBR2,Name is everything these days so I had to grab this cryaola paper! It's tried and true arrived early too!,5
B003W0PBR2,"This product was in sale, and it's on my kindergartner's supply list. Got it while I could, and waaaaay before I needed to shop for it. I don't like doings last minute, especially when I already have a really good idea of what they need. Can't go wrong with Crayola!",5
B003W0PBR2,Works well and colors look good,5
B003W0PBR2,These worked well.,5
B003W0PBR2,"I bought 11 packages of these to send to all my grandkids of varying ages during Spring Break.  They were all excited to get them.  I received fun pictures of the things they made.This is a great, inexpensive gift.",5
B003W0PBR2,With summer here- this is a great item for any craft projects - for young and old !,5
B003W0PBR2,Good product for the price. This will be used for grandkids projects.,5
B003W0PBR2,I do a lot of crafts with my children.  This is the nest name brand for construction paper.  The order came very fast.  Exactly what I needed for an amazing price.,5
B003W0PBR2,"This is a good, sturdy construction paper. I purchased 2 during a deal.",5
B003W0PBR2,"I need Red and Black colors for paper cutting, but their colors are pink/peach and dark grey and the texture is rough too.On the top is a Crayola A4 in red comparing with my 8k paper at the back. The difference is enormous! However, the price is unbeatable $3.45 for 96 sheets and the papers are good for drafting due to its coarse surface.",3
B003W0PBR2,i liked all products ordered.they  will work well for school.,5
B003W0PBR2,Great for crafts,5
B003W0PBR2,"Not great quality paper, but are surely useful for all the fun crafting work.",5
B003W0PBR2,The colors are bright and cheerful! I used it in my card making. It makes great envelopes.,5
B003W0PBR2,Is construction paper getting thinner? It seems like it is thinner than other paper I have purchased.,4
B003W0PBR2,Came in handy for the project,5
B003W0PBR2,My daughter told me this paper is really good! So .. if she happy is all matters. Is a good material and the colors are so bright.,5
B003W0PBR2,"I made a really great paper airplane out of one of these sheets of construction paper. I went outside yesterday and launched it into the sky, and I haven't seen it since. I would rate only 4 stars because it flew too far, but I don't want to be petty and blame Crayola.",5
B003W0PBR2,"The colors are a little dull, but my daughter really enjoys doing crafts and art with these.  It's a good buy over all.",5
B003W0PBR2,We use Crayola construction paper for everything! From coloring to crafts,5
B003W0PBR2,Good for arts and crafts with your little one,5
B003W0PBR2,"This is nice construction paper. I mainly chose it for the variety of colors and because Crayola stuff is usually better than store or generic brands. The paper is arranged so that I can get a small stack with one of each color off the top and give to my son, so there's less waste and he can have a variety of colors to choose from but we won't run through the stack so fast.",5
B003W0PBR2,It was the best deal for the kids to have fun and make what ever they wanted to make,5
B003W0PBR2,Paper was great wonderful colors,5
B003W0PBR2,"I'm not the only one saying it, but this isn't your grandma's construction paper. They don't make this stuff like they used to! It's not BAD, but it's not what I wanted. (I did expect it though, because I read some of the reviews.) This stuff is thinner than what I used to use in school. I'm not sure any brand makes the stuff we used to use. So it's construction paper, but don't expect to construct much out of it unless you fold or double up. For drawing and other crafty things, you should be fine.",3
B003W0PBR2,Buy this.,5
B003W0PBR2,Drawing and constructing paper airplanes.,4
B003W0PBR2,"Very nice, worth to buy",5
B003W0PBR2,"Not only was this a great buy, but it is also loaded with different colors!",5
B003W0PBR2,Kids like them because they could make pictures of their stuffed animals and baby bottles for them.,5
B003W0PBR2,"The paper was thin, but good for the price.",4
B003W0PBR2,Grandchildren always enjoy having lots of paper and scissors around on rainy days.,5
B003W0PBR2,Its super easy to tear and really thin but for the price its good,4
B003W0PBR2,Great set. Kids cut it up and made a huge mess it was a blast,5
B003W0PBR2,"Seemed light, but it wasn't sub par",4
B003W0PBR2,This was an awesome value! Bought it on sale. Worrh every penny. Wish I'd gotten more!,5
B003W0PBR2,I was a bit disappointed. I thought this paper would be a bit thicker but its just cheap colored paper. Even kids glue seeped right through it.,3
B003W0PBR2,Nice sturdy construction paper! Came new and unfaded. Happy with purchase,5
B003W0PBR2,Nice colors,5
B003W0PBR2,"Gift for 11 yr old, can't really lose with Crayola!",5
B003W0PBR2,My great granddaughter loves to make things and just love the thickness and sturdiness of the paper.,5
B003W0PBR2,I bought this for my grandkids and they had a great time!!,5
B06XRLTJWM,These are a great value compared to others.  High quality.  Repeat purchase for me.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Thick lamination paper. Works good.,5
B06XRLTJWM,My team goes through a high volume of laminate. We have purchased this item multiple times. Great value!,5
B06XRLTJWM,Perfect,5
B06XRLTJWM,Good,5
B06XRLTJWM,It works i guess. Does NOT lay flat after laminating. Tends to curl slightly. Causes a problem when my students are playing games. I have laminated several items with several different laminator. Definitely the pouches. Unfortunately my previous AWESOME brand has been discontinue. So stuck with this.,3
B06XRLTJWM,This deal was great for the amount of pages I received. I have already used 20 of them. Great seller...,5
B06XRLTJWM,"These thicker laminator sheets are great for tags, lighter weight badges, or when you need something that isn't as bendable. The only thing I have found that was an issue (for me) was I had to place things further apart than a thinner sheet due to the edges not sealing as close if using thicker paper. If you use a regular sheet of paper it is fine. I was using extra heavy duty cardstock 100# weight and the thick paper in the thicker sleeve had a harder time sealing close to the edges of the paper. Otherwise these are wonderful and I will buy again!",5
B06XRLTJWM,Works just as they should.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Great,5
B06XRLTJWM,I go through these like crazy. They are great for task cards and copies that I don't want to get damaged. Will definitely buy again.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Love the thickest of the film.,5
B06XRLTJWM,I have used these laminating sheets for creating center games and classroom signs multiple times. They are clear and very durable.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Bueno producto,5
B06XRLTJWM,I use these at a preschool I help at to get curriculum ready for teachers. I recently ended up purchasing a laminator for personal use and bought a box of these for home. They work great and have never gave me an issue!Highly recommend,5
B06XRLTJWM,"Great product, great price and works well with my laminator. Would recommend and will be buying again.",5
B06XRLTJWM,I love these laminating sheets. They are perfect for the school teacher who laminates a lot of things.,5
B06XRLTJWM,"I have a tendency to laminate way too much, I always need a lot of laminating sheets around.",5
B06XRLTJWM,The product came very quickly and very easy to use.,4
B06XRLTJWM,This product works great. Clear and unwrinkled.,5
B06XRLTJWM,"So when I read the reviews for this I was a bit worried because other reviews mentioned wrinkling.  However, I believe that was for the 3mm size.  I purchased the 5mm size which are thicker and they have worked perfectly with my laminator.  I will definitely purchase these again.  Very clear views and absolutely no wrinkles.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"I purchased a laminator for personal use and after using the sample lamination pouches that came with it, I decided I needed to purchase a package. Did a lot of research and found these, the same brand we use at work, to be the best value. I laminated about 30 recipes the other day, I and love how they came out. Easy to open the pouches and easy to feed through my laminator. Would definitely recommend these.",5
B06XRLTJWM,Great buy for the amount,5
B06XRLTJWM,These are very good and study.,5
B06XRLTJWM,I specifically looked for laminating sheets that were thicker. There worked very well!,5
B06XRLTJWM,I am pretty picky about laminating. This product works really well. I am very pleased.,5
B06XRLTJWM,These laminating pouches work great for plain and stock paper.,5
B06XRLTJWM,"Thin thin thin. Very sadly thin. And the adhesion is so bad. Terrible. I have no issue using Scotch brand, and went from that straight to this and it was terrible. it will be easily bent, not adhere to edges hardly at all, and they shift around pretty bad inside the package. Great for full pages if you don't want thickness and you want to baby the stuff through the whole process. It takes serious attention to how it is fed through, and watching every second as it laminates pretty much. I didn't have any crinkly issues doing that but it had a rough time making the adhesion stick cleanly on edges. I had to set my machine to 5 mil at this thin to get any decent use. Hope this helps. I would say if you don't want too thick, just a film of protection, this will do the job, that's why 2 stars and not 1. Cheers everyone!",2
B06XRLTJWM,Quality lamination sheets. Recommended. Did not have to use glue to hold smaller pieces.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Easy to handle and use. Speedy delivery too.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Love these!  Perfect for laminating sticker sheets for work or church.  They are a bit thicker and don't wrinkle when going through my machine.  Edges are rounded and not sharp!,5
B06XRLTJWM,I loved it! Quality was great and it did the job well. I recommend it,5
B06XRLTJWM,Happy with purchase,5
B06XRLTJWM,Bien,5
B06XRLTJWM,Muy buena,5
B06XRLTJWM,they are just as thick as the scotch brand so nice buy when they are on sale and scotch is not. I prefer these other the amazon brand which is thinner.,4
B06XRLTJWM,Quality and gets the job done.,5
B06XRLTJWM,good job,5
B06XRLTJWM,"Pouches don't work well with cold lamination, fine with heat.  My only criticism is of Amazon sending these out without any box or package.  Left on my door step with just the outer packaging.",5
B06XRLTJWM,Just what I order Shipping was fast and they were package great I will buy from them again Thanks,5
B06XRLTJWM,Easy to use Lamination pouches,5
B06XRLTJWM,I purchased these to use with my personal laminator.  These are high quality and durable.  I love that my students can dry erase on them and they easily erase.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Perfect clarity and quality. No complaints,5
B06XRLTJWM,"I use these to laminate signs for our classes & labs, even decorations for the office.  Love them!",5
B06XRLTJWM,Better than some I have purchased.  But not as stiff as some I have purchased.  Good value and quality other than that.,4
B06XRLTJWM,"These laminating sheets are perfect, they work every single time exactly the way they need to. We'll be purchasing again when needed",5
B06XRLTJWM,"I use this at home for school items that I want to last a long time. The 5mm thickness makes a sturdy cover for cards, pictures, write on pages, and a lot of other things. Easy for children to handle and to use.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"Although the laminating sheets were exactly what I wanted, the box the holds the sheets was so destroyed I almost returned the item.  But I needed them for a project and didn't have time to return and order a new box.  Using the current box will be very inconvenient as it is too badly messed up.  This box looked like it had been used and returned many times prior to me receiving it.  It was NOT damaged in shipping as it was part of a larger order and well packed for shipping.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"Easy to use product and with so many included at a decent price, I can laminate to my hearts desire.  Just open the flap and place your desired drawing/ paper/ art work in and through the machine.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"Good laminate sheets. Sometimes there is a small fold that causes a raised line imperfection that cannot be corrected after it has gone through, but that could be user error also. Just have to go slower and ensure it is 100% flat before it goes through.Extra items are okay. The paper trimmer is very flimsy and not worth using it. Just get a fiskars trimmer. Cover to house then is also thinner.Overall happy.",5
B06XRLTJWM,Great laminating sheets and very inexpensive. Have bought this brand twice. Very happy.,5
B06XRLTJWM,These laminating pouches worked with my laminator. They were good quality and did the job.,5
B06XRLTJWM,I use them like crazy for laminating things at school. Great value and works great with my scotch brand laminator,4
B06XRLTJWM,"I am a teacher and wanted to laminate some spelling lists, card stock dividers and some inexpensive flash card decks.  These sheets work perfectly in my existing machine.  I was very happy with the results and would buy them again.  Obsoletely no problem feeding them through the machine.  100 sheets will last me a while.  :)",5
B06XRLTJWM,Quick delivery.,5
B06XRLTJWM,"It is inconsistent in securing sealed pouches.  Some are better sealed than others.  I learned that one must wait a minute or more between sealings.  It is acceptable, but not as good as I have experienced in past.  It will last some time yet I hope.  It is a convenient size and easily set up.  Thank you.  God bless you.",4
B06XRLTJWM,"I like the product itself.  I have ordered before and the brand is good.  However, when I received my package, it was completely torn up.  My outside packaging was fine, so it was taken off the shelf and packaged this way. Very disappointed! I needed it today, so cannot return. I do not have anything to keep it stored now. Ridiculous the carelessness.",3
B06XRLTJWM,"I have the amazon basics laminator which I totally recommend. These laminating sheets work great with it. I have never had a problem with them not fully laminating, getting stuck, or not being thick enough. I have used these in some else's scotch laminator before and did not have any problems with them. They are nice and thick and if you want it thicker you can get the 5mm ones as well and they work just as well.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"Very nice laminating pouches. The 5 mil are definitely the way to go--you can get waves from the 3 mil ones, but these give you a very sturdy and solid final product. These are crystal clear, and work quite well with the Amazon Basics laminator. The only thing to watch for is that they can sometimes stick together--I have run two pouches that were stuck together through my laminator on more than one occasion, wasting a pouch, though I have finally caught on and now pay extra attention before laminating. Even when running two through accidentally, the actual laminate came out just fine--I just had an additional pouch processed with nothing inside it and so wasted. Not sure why Amazon doesn't offer 5 mil pouches under their own brand... I bought their 3 mil pouches with my laminator, which work okay, but aren't nearly as solid as these 5 mil pouches are. It may not seem like much, but the difference is really quite dramatic.",5
B06XRLTJWM,The item arrived on time.  The items was described as it is.  Clear when a picture is laminated.  The price is right for 300 sheets that I purchased.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Great cost. Does the job,5
B06XRLTJWM,"I am so very impressed with the quality of this machine, how easy it is to use, the quality of work it does and would highly recommend it to anyone. I do an enormous amount of laminations and this machine does the job perfectly!",5
B06XRLTJWM,Everything they said it was.,5
B06XRLTJWM,"I really like these pouches.  I have used several brands (scotch, amazon, other generics) and I have not seen any consistent difference between any of them.  Most of the difference I notice is before lamination.  Once it goes through the laminator, I can't tell the difference between any of them.  I took off one star because the edges curled on 3 or 4 sheets, out of the hundred or so I have used.  That was the first time I had seen that problem and it could have just been the way I put it into the machine.  I plan to start using these as my go to pouches because they are so much cheaper it's worth the couple of curled edges (which I usually cut off anyway).",4
B06XRLTJWM,We use these for business papers and they were perfect! The only thing is they are flimsy even after laminated so they will bend easily then thicker laminate sheets.,4
B06XRLTJWM,These are great. You get so much for your money and they work very well.,5
B06XRLTJWM,Great value.,5
B06XRLTJWM,"When putting a piece of paper in the pouch, it doesn't slide in at all, it clings to the thermal pouch and you have to struggle with it to get it all the way in and center it.  Not very easy to use, very time consuming>",3
B06XRLTJWM,"Tested and worked perfectly!  They're slightly thinner than the brand I normally use however works just as good.  Love these for our homeschool projects, crafting and more.  Very satisfied... this is my second purchase.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"As a teacher, the school laminator is usually down or our jobs are done with low quality laminate.These sheets are perfect for the items that we will need to reuse for years to come.",5
B06XRLTJWM,Exactly what I wanted,5
B06XRLTJWM,"A little flimsy collared to scotch brand, but once you laminate-it is fantastic! Would buy again! 200 for $17-great deal!",4
B06XRLTJWM,"Purchased these laminating pouches for my wife. She is a kindergarten teacher, and she will be using them in her classroom.So far, she has no complaints. She is happy. Thats all that matters.",5
B06XRLTJWM,"This compact, easy-to-use laminator is great for our small-office use. We use it to laminate notices for posting, our health insurance/Rx cards (which, surprisingly, are still printed on card stock), and yes, a few personal projects (bookmarks, key tags, etc.). Great that it has an auto-off feature too because we ""lost"" a previous one (also a Fellowes model) that someone left on over a long weekend, which damaged it beyond repair. We've had it for just one month so can't speak to durability, but until the long-weekend disaster with our previous laminator, we'd used it successfully for at least 5 years, so I anticipate that this will also be durable.",5
B06XRLTJWM,Likes it.,4
B06XRLTJWM,Perfect. I have bought these in the past from them. Always good product,5
B06XRLTJWM,UPDATE: 2/2023 have been ordering these for years never with any problems and product was reliably as advertised. BUT this time I ordered they definitely feel a LOT thinner than normal. Worked fine with my machine but definitely thinnerThese are the standard lamination pouch's. Great product. Laminated well with no problems. Half the price of the store. Definitely would order again.,4
B06XRLTJWM,"I love these sheets; they work really well, even on my old laminator. my only wish is that they could be treated with an antistatic to help since they are very hard to insert papers with static electricity.",5
B06XRLTJWM,Durable,4
B06XRLTJWM,This is a great product other than the fact that some of the laminating sheets are defective and can not be used.  We didn't realize it till we had started using some of the sheets for use and then got to a section where we pulled out defective sheets.  Great product just not sure it is worth the purchase when you don't have as many to use as expected.,3
B06XRLTJWM,"a little sticky to get apart and fit the page into. When finished the pages curl so badly, to offset it i have to fold the page in the opposite direction, which of course, pretty much ruins the page. The laminator gets hot very fast, within 5 pages. Had high hopes but dissappointed.",2
B06XRLTJWM,These are nice quality and easy to use.,5
B08CGMYQGN,The colors were super vibrant. The only color that gave me a little trouble was the yellow but I just had to keep layering and it eventually became vibrant. It lasted for over 8 hours on my face with no budging. Super creamy. I did not have any stains on my face afterwards and it was super easy to wash off.  I loved this product.,5
B08CGMYQGN,"I used this for a halloween look this year. I saw this on TikTok shop but decided to order it off of here just for the convenience. I was worried about the pigment showing on my skin, since i'm a darker complexion because another face paint I bought (Maydear facepaint) didn't show at all on my skin. But this showed really well, I didn't have to use a lot and it's a paste so I didn't have to do too much to get it on me. I also did this look with my finger which tells a lot about the product since you can't even tell.Now for the cons,The red stained my face for a few daysIt's not smudge proof at allIt stained my clothes, even after I washed it a few timesIt was creasing under my eyesThe top layer of the paint is not the same color as the rest (you can just mix it in or just take it off to fix it tho)Other than that, I would recommend this paint to anyone who has sensitive skin, worried about it showing on their skin, and people who don't like matte/liquid paint.",4
B08CGMYQGN,I bought this for my daughter to paint her face for her high school football games and she loves it. Her friends come over and they all do their face before games. She has also used it to paint her face for other occasions,5
B08CGMYQGN,LOVED this for Halloween!! Easy and so smooth,5
B08CGMYQGN,"Colors work fine and are easy to apply but very difficult to remove from skin! Some residue stayed on my kids' skin for days even though we tried to remove with warm water, soap whipes etc.",3
B08CGMYQGN,It stayed on for a long time and it felt comfortable on my face. It also had a strong pigment which i needed for colors to pop on my face.,5
B08CGMYQGN,Bought this for a stage production and it worked very well. Needs to be set with a powder for sure but overall very happy with the purchase.,4
B08CGMYQGN,it is colorful just needs a little of pigmentation more,4
B08CGMYQGN,My daughter likes to make different looks with face paint. She told me this was the best face paint she had ever had.,5
B08CGMYQGN,todo tal cual lo pedi,5
B08CGMYQGN,Mildly easy to apply slightly tacky consistency so a good blender is necessary. It does slightly stain but makeup remover takes care of that pretty easy. Over all I would recommend,4
B08CGMYQGN,"A little patchy but layers well and has nice color density. Used it on my boyfriend and bestfriend for Halloween make up and it works well and stayed on pretty well minus my boyfriend, who kept touching his face and ate a greasy burger lol here's his face paint at the end of the night. Some of the colors are stubborn and can stain your skin, but I let a little coconut oil sit on his face for a minute and it cleared it right up without having to scrub and irritate his skin.",4
B08CGMYQGN,Best Halloween makeup there is,5
B08CGMYQGN,"Buen servicio, entrega rapida y el articulo se encuentra en perfectas condiciones.Gracias.",5
B08CGMYQGN,They are ok . Squares are small making hard to get in sponge . Pigment is ok . I bought this for personal use. As a FT face painter .  I would not uses these,4
B08CGMYQGN,Stays bright. Goes on smooth,5
B08CGMYQGN,"Loved the makeup, it was ordered and used for a Halloween event. It washed off easily and is a lot better for the skin, compared to store bought Halloween makeup.",5
B08CGMYQGN,"I love this, I wanted to get them for someone long that when I try them I was no disappointed, I love them",5
B08CGMYQGN,I used it for Halloween face paint and it works really good just trust the process,5
B08CGMYQGN,"The paint quality is very good,  The purchaser will need makeup brushes to apply and sponges to blend with but overall quality product . Washes of with soap and water.",4
B08CGMYQGN,"For what you pay, you get lots of product.  Good choice of colors, and each compartment is filled to the top.  Wish I had more talent for painting to make better use of them.",5
B08CGMYQGN,Easy to use. The paint will smudge a little while wearing it.,5
B08CGMYQGN,Nice,4
B08CGMYQGN,I used this product for a holloween costume and I ended up winning first place in a contest!,5
B08CGMYQGN,Not all that great for small detailing. Came out really streaky but I could be using it wrong. I went back and tried putting eyeshadow over top but it just came out chunky.,3
B08CGMYQGN,Nice,4
B08CGMYQGN,Great,5
B08CGMYQGN,Thank you,5
B08CGMYQGN,Don't know if just my face but I really couldn't get it to not look even or not patchy .. I tried primer and all the prep I could do and it still look off to me .. setting powder kinda helped . It is a nice pallet for the price and I will use all of it the filters helped make it look good,4
B08CGMYQGN,Bought this face paint to use for Halloween on my children's faces. It was easy to apply. It looked really good but is oil based so if my son touched his face any It smeared really easy. It didn't dry to the touch. The colors were really vibrant and looked nice on all of them. I did a rainbow on my daughter's face and the colors were all beautiful.  There was some trouble getting all the paint off of their faces. It stained around the hairline. A shower the next completely removed it. There's alot of colors to choose from and alot of paint in them. I have put away so I can use next halloween too.,4
B08CGMYQGN,Its a bit dry but if you scoop out a bit and mix it with a bit of water it works like paint! highly recommended,4
B08CGMYQGN,My granddaughter used for Halloween,5
B08CGMYQGN,"The red and brown can stain your skin.Thankfully, I wear makeup to work every day, because the faint outline of a penis was on my cheek until my shower that night (which was my second shower since the face paint the day before).  That's the last time my kids get to put face paint on me.If you're a guy, this makeup trick probably won't work for you, so I recommend you avoid those two colors OR only let people put things on you that you're willing to have a faint outline of for a couple of days.",4
B08CGMYQGN,Muy buena paleta,5
B08CGMYQGN,Wish there was more pigment to this pallet. Red will only look orange.,3
B08CGMYQGN,Loved this makeup kit! it was perfect for halloween makeup and lots of pigment! it will smear though if you rub it so be cautious but i loved it!,5
B08CGMYQGN,"its nice but it is oil based so it will come off  with some rubbing if you were planning on using it on ur arms or neck, it is easy to wash off and leaves no staining",3
B08CGMYQGN,"So I was extremely excited to use this pallet and I originally purchased it for Halloween for my kids and it worked OK for some line whiskers or easy little quick face paints however it is not what I was expecting for being able to layer and I thought the pigment was going to be a lot More pigmented, but as you can tell by the pictures, I mean, one layer was very opaque. I tried applying with face paint sponges with the wedge face paint, sponges, different brushes, whether it's acrylic brush or a plastic artificial brush I even use makeup brushes and just my I also use my fingers And beauty blenders, and even like a dry pressed powder brush it just would not every time I try to add a layer or touch up it would take off. It was already on there. I used a primer I used moisturizer. I used setting powder and nothing helped. It was just terrible. It was terrible And taking it off. Don't even get me started on that. It is like you just put layers of clay on your face and I know that's from the pressed powder adding it to it however it's more of an oil base I guess and just was not at all what I was looking for. I've used probably about four or five different brands and to this day, my favorite, which is what I will be ordering in just a bit is just that  SNAZAROO. It tries great and isn't flaky. You can tell him one of my pictures at the end I was trying to do the Grinch and I just gave up because it was just disgusting and it was getting like Kiki and little balls were coming up on my brush and it was coming off of my face or making patches and I wasn't able to really fix the patch. It was just terrible guys. I was extremely disappointed so combine all the great reviews with mine and this is the most honest as I can be. Thank you.",1
B08CGMYQGN,I thought the consistency was going to be smooth but it went on my skin SHEAR like I need more pigmentation please!,3
B08CGMYQGN,I like how pigmented the colors are. The paint is easy to work with. I used it to paint faces at a kids party,5
B08CGMYQGN,The silver and gold are lacking a certain texture that the rest of the colors have but overall I love it and use it once a week for fun.,5
B08CGMYQGN,"This was such a great palette! I was impressed by the quality. Very easy to apply, great colors, very happy!",5
B08CGMYQGN,"Used the sky blue shade over top of a white clown base. Used it for my Inside Out ""Sadness"" costume.",5
B08CGMYQGN,if you wanted this paint for some costume i feel like it wouldnt work as well. i tried every possible way to make it work but it was very splotchy and you could see my skin tone underneath..,3
B08CGMYQGN,"I liked that it feels very lightweight, but had to do a few layers to get a good amount of color. It's buildable but also doesn't blend with ease. Perfectly okay for the price, but I wouldn't buy again.",3
B08CGMYQGN,Love this,5
B08CGMYQGN,When opening this package I had noticed that the red had an indentation on it as well as the black seeming to have brush strokes.,3
B08CGMYQGN,"This is perfect , does not smudge . A bit hard to remove with just water . You can remove with baby oil and soap",5
B08CGMYQGN,I didn't realize this was oil paint until I used to paint my niece face for her birthday it came out ok but it's very easy to smudge and it doesn't dry face,3
B08CGMYQGN,"Most colors are bright and have good coverage, some of the darker colors need to be worked a little more for better coverage , but they STAIN BAD",3
B08CGMYQGN,14 year old girl has fun with it,5
B08CGMYQGN,"This palette has a nice selection of colors. The pinks and orange are bright. I used a light application of translucent powder to set the design in place. Before beginning, a Skin prep will help the finished look. I did a quick glycolic acid wipe on clean skin and waited five minutes. Washed it off and towel dried my face. Topped with a good moisturizer, and silicone based primer. I should have used a Barrier spray. The makeup look stayed in place for hours. To remove, I used a face wash, Vaseline on a cotton ball, and some Micellar water remover. The next morning, there is still slightly pink stains anywhere the bright colors had been applied.",4
B08CGMYQGN,Love this palette! Had so much fun playing in it,5
B08CGMYQGN,I loved this,5
B08CGMYQGN,It does smudge easy however if you spray some setting spray on it it helps.,4
B08CGMYQGN,"These face paints are great, there is a great selection of colors and they work perfectly for cosplay makeup. I have used them for face painting and also to change the color of my eyebrows, and it looked great! Since the face paints are oil based they don't dry completely, which makes it very easy to remove but leaves it at risk of being smuged, though I found putting translucent powder over the areas I use the paint on helps keep it on all day. If you use these paints to change your eyebrow color, I reccomend doing so before you do your base/face makeup as it can smudge a little but the excess can easily be wiped away. My only small complaint is the black isn't super opaque, however it is still good for sketching out outlines and then you can go over it with an eyeliner for a more solid look. The rest of the colors I have used so far have been great!",5
B08CGMYQGN,Application was smooth easy to use,5
B08CGMYQGN,"This was much nicer than your drug store Halloween makeup. Impressed with the amount of paint, the nice container and how well it went on. However, for anyone doing winter activities, best to put on indoors or in warm area as when it gets cold outside (under 40F), it gets harder to get enough paint on the brush and to spread on skin. But using indoors like a normal person it works great!  We were doing a group theme and a couple of the colors, like dark teal, were more stubborn to get off of eyebrows and the fuscia color left a little shadow behind on skin. Suggestions were to use olive oil but I found soaking in a warm tub/hot shower for a bit helped loosen it.",5
B08CGMYQGN,Muy buena pigmentacion,5
B08CGMYQGN,"Good pigments that are easy to use and paint. Unfortunately,  it took forever to dry in our humidity, so many kids were smearing thier face paint",4
B08CGMYQGN,"The case came a bit cracked, but the colors are very beautiful, and none of the paints have been used. I haven't tested it yet, but I'm eager to since some of the reviews mentioned that it doesn't bother people with sensitive skin. I'll keep you updated.",4
B08CGMYQGN,"This face paint is really good for people who like doing full face paints and body paint, as expected of course. There's so much of each color, and they are quite pigmented. It's also very easy to take of with a baby wipe. Overall 10/10 recommend.",5
B08CGMYQGN,"I've had this paint for a while now, it has great pigment applies really well witha sponge but it smudges sooo easy do not put near your clothes it will rub off, if its hot it will sweat off.",3
B00004TS5V,"Loved these! Great price for a quality product, used them to preserve some of our ultrasound pics",5
B00004TS5V,I used these for my ultrasounds. They protected them so great and keep them looking like new!,5
B00004TS5V,"I purchased these after looking at ""luggage tags"" for our diaper bag for the church nursery.  On Etsy, I was looking at paying 15 dollars for 2.  I was able to login to canva and design my own wallet sized graphic.  I then printed them off and used these pouches to ""laminate"".  They came out looking better than the ones I would have paid for, if not better!Super easy to use!",5
B00004TS5V,Love these! Great price.,5
B00004TS5V,These were perfect to laminate my ultrasound pictures and very easy to use. Only downside is I wish more would in a pack as I had to buy 6 packs for all my ultrasounds,4
B00004TS5V,Self-sticking sheets of very thin clear vinyl/plastic.  Sheets can be cut to size needed.  Lift & seal.,5
B00004TS5V,These were awesome for saving the ultrasounds we got of our daughter. Perfect size so I didn't need to trim down the edges at all. User friendly and I know my precious keepsakes will be safe for a lifetime!,5
B00004TS5V,The material used is firm and stiff enough to make it easier to work with and prevent unintended creases. The adhesive works great as well.,5
B00004TS5V,These are the best self sealing laminating pouches they are high quality and super clear.,5
B00004TS5V,I used these to save my ultrasound photos from creasing and getting messy. They are wonderful! Highly recommend.,5
B00004TS5V,I put everything in these little pockets and they keep unwrinkled and unworn.  My old covid card to my medicare card lives inside this little pouch safely.  Very satisfied. thank you,5
B00004TS5V,"They come in different sizes. From real small to 9"" x12"". Been using since 1992. Note on medium to 9x12/ take your time,they can get cockeyed sometimes and stick to itself,then your done with that. If very important papers,have someone help you,move slowly I've had a few goofs,but I find invaluable. Once you get the hang of it,you'll like.  12 stars.  11-14-24",5
B00004TS5V,Its confusing at first but it really is good at keeping pictures safe,5
B00004TS5V,They were difficult to use,3
B00004TS5V,"We use it for SS cards, ultrasound pictures, benefit cards. Perfect seal.",4
B00004TS5V,This is perfect if you just need to laminate one or two smaller items. I gifted it along with a lifetime fishing license and it made the gift complete.,5
B00004TS5V,These are perfect for mamas who want to preserve some ultrasound photos. Really good quality and value. Was able to keep a pump of photos for memories. Nice thick material.,5
B00004TS5V,I like the fact that the pictures ii put in remain stable!!!!,5
B00004TS5V,"Love this product, finally able to laminate paper card such as insurance and reward cards for use then cut access off for use in wallet.",5
B00004TS5V,"Easy to use, super sticky and perfect for ultrasound pictures",5
B00004TS5V,I used these to preserve my ultrasound pictures that were getting damaged. I would recommend doing a test run at first to make sure you are using the product correctly and don't ruin your photos. I did it incorrectly the first time and ended up with bubbles.,5
B00004TS5V,I was worried about bubbles forming as I am not at all experienced with these kinds of things. No bubbles! Easy to use with clear instructions.,5
B00004TS5V,I wish I knew about these for my first kiddo. They are the perfect size and easy to put together.,5
B00004TS5V,So easy to use. Worked wonders for preserving my sonogram pics!,5
B00004TS5V,Great for small IF or document protection,5
B00004TS5V,"Before you use this product make sure everything is lying flat. My photo was a little scrunched up and I couldn't unstick it again, so I had to try my best to smooth out the bubble. Still came out decent.",5
B00004TS5V,"I got these to save my ultrasound photos, I was high risk and had so many pictures that I wanted to save. They are very easy to use and create a thick cover for whatever you are laminating. Adhesion is strong so be careful when sticking together.",5
B00004TS5V,Used these for my ultrasound pictures and I loved how they turned out.,5
B00004TS5V,Excellent product. Easy to use. I keep buying it. Helped me a lot to preserve and organize my stuff.,5
B00004TS5V,These work great if you are givea paper ID card that you can use these to laminate.,5
B00004TS5V,Does the purpose and is easy to use. I cut it in half for reg. size business size cards to get the most out of them . 3rd time re-ordering.,5
B00004TS5V,I keep important information sealed in this self laminated pouch in my wallet in case needed in emergencies.  Great source of  comfort that I will have the information that could be needed available!,5
B00004TS5V,They are what I needed,5
B00004TS5V,"I was desperately looking for something like this for my ultrasound pictures. They were starting to curl up and I didn't want them getting ruined. I was searching for all different options and didn't want to buy a laminating device. I came across these on Facebook and figured I would try them out and they are amazing. They are super simple to use, and the pictures are perfect now. I wish they came with more than 5 in a pack but for the price still not that bad at all. Would cost way more to have to buy a laminating machine and the supplies.",5
B00004TS5V,sturdy enough and easy to apply.  no complaints,5
B00004TS5V,Used them for my ultrasound photos. It took all of 10 minutes to do all. This product makes it so easy to preserve pictures!,5
B00004TS5V,Be sure to leave a edge around your photo or article so the laminating edges will adhere to each other.,5
B00004TS5V,Been using these  self laminating sheets for my ultrasound pictures best kept secret for moms or family memories,5
B00004TS5V,Worked good to laminate several wallet sized cards. You can laminate 2 cards at the same time if they are credit card size. I had to trim my Medicare paper card down slightly so that it would still fit in my wallet after laminating. This might be needed because if you trim the laminate too close it will delaminate.,5
B00004TS5V,Worked as expected,5
B00004TS5V,Very durable.,5
B00004TS5V,"Worked well for laminating my baby's ultrasound pictures. Unfortunately, some of them got pretty wrinkled and ended up with bubbles/bumps. It was kind of tricky to get the hang of it at first. You kind of have to get it right the first time. Overall worked well for my purpose.",4
B00004TS5V,"I used these to preserve my ultrasound pictures from my first child and will definitely use them again they are perfect and laminated the ultrasound well, super easy to do!",5
B00004TS5V,"These are an easy way to laminate cards, etc.",5
B00004TS5V,"These are a great option for pictures or papers that you don't want to fade overtime. They are very easy to use, and good quality. Once the two sides are sealed together, they material is decently thick, and not very bendable. 10/10 recommend.",5
B00004TS5V,Nice fo protecting small documents that are frequently used & subject to damage,4
B00004TS5V,I used these to seal homemade paper ornaments and they worked so well!!They are thick and durable and easy to use. I punched holes in them easily.I'll buy these again for more homemade ornaments next season!,5
B00004TS5V,Very good value for the money and fit what I need it to. The thickness and adhesion was good and it also seem like it will be durable,5
B00004TS5V,"These ""laminators"" are perfect for protecting cards, photos, etc. that you don't want damaged.  They are EXTREMELY EASY to use and have a nice degree of durability.  They are easy to trim after ""laminating"" (make sure you leave a 1/4"" ""border"" around the ""laminated"" item) so you don't have an ""oversized"" card.Adhesion tip: after you ""laminate"" your item, place it on a HArD AND FLAT surface.  Using a ""blunt"" object, ""trace"" around the card/photo edge, applying pressure to the edge ""gap"", to fully seal the edge.  Funally, RUB THE OVERALL SURFACE with the ""blunt"" object to help remove any ""fine"" bubbles and ensure the surface is maximally ""clear"" over the card/photo.  These actions will ensure maximum adhesion and help prevent any ""voids"" from appearing.Yes, I ** DO INDEED ** recommend this item!",5
B00004TS5V,Easy to use and convenient that you do not need to apply any heat or need extra equipment. Recommend doing a test run before actually trying on the item you need to make sure you get the hang of it as the first one can be tricky. This was perfect for laminating my ultrasound images!,5
B00004TS5V,"Item arrived on time as described in new condition.Item was delivered on a rainy day in an envelope then left in a puddle, despite having a covered porch 10ft away.... Odd but nothing to do with product! HaI kept getting bubbles at first, improved by the end of the package. I've used this product many times before, could not figure out why bubbles kept occuring as there were no signs of defect and I didn't change my ways....strange. Maybe temperature or the material?Ended up finding a way better price in a local store so I get them there now.",4
B00004TS5V,I bought these to keep my ultrasounds from getting ruined. Little tricky at first but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy. Would buy again.,4
B00004TS5V,"These are great for ultrasound photos. Was super easy to use once I figured it out. I thought the directions were a little hard to follow and I had to watch a video to figure it out. Other than that, great product!!",4
B00004TS5V,"This product worked perfectly on a couple of cardboard medical cards, that otherwise would have been ruined in our wallets.  Now they are protected...and I have sheets of laminate to spare for my next project!",5
B00004TS5V,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I tried a few other ones but this is hands down the best and easiest self laminating product!,5
B00004TS5V,Loved these for protecting our ultrasound pictures from our first baby!,5
B00004TS5V,"No laminating matching required. Easy to use, sturdy and holds up to use. We use ours to laminate health insurance cards, auto insurance cards, etc. A little pricy, but well worth the money.",5
B00004TS5V,Need a quick laminate and did the job!,5
B00004TS5V,These are made with a cover that protects the sticky side. One edge is already sealed more than necessary so you lose a few centimeters. I ended up pulling it apart to have more use of the edge. Application sucks but end result is great,3
B00004TS5V,work perfect for what i wanted it to do,5
B00004TS5V,Surprised these worked well saving my sonogram pictures! Will buy again!,5
B00004TS5V,"These are exactly what I needed, my ultrasound pictures were no longer straight the were beginning to fold I found these & I was able to place to in 1 slot although you have to be careful placing two in one otherwise one will start to wrinkle up. I slightly messed up the first time but after that I was able to get the rest in with no problem. Definitely worth the buy!",5
B00004TS5V,Perfect,5
B00004TS5V,I wanted something to protect my ultrasound pictures because of how flimsy & bendable they are & these were perfect for them. You can even cut off the excess edges as long as you leave a little space still for it to stick to itself,5
B00004TS5V,These are nice and work well,5
B00004TS5V,I bought this product to keep some of the photos that are special to me it took me a few minutes to use this and they look amazing. It does take a minute to figure out how to use it but once you are able to do that they are easy to use.,5
B00004TS5V,There were a couple of photos that had creases because I went too fast. Should warn you to take your time even if you think you got the hang of it.Overall great product and easy to follow instructions,5
B00004TS5V,Easy to use,5
B00004TS5V,I have used it before and find it easy to manage,5
B00004TS5V,I use these sheets to put a laminate cover over my car insurance and health insurance card that I keep in my wallet. Easy to use for a decent price!,5
B00004TS5V,Bought one pack of these to try out for my ultrasound pictures. Definitely ordering more for the rest of them. It is so easy to use and I am so happy to have something to protect these photos!,5
B00004TS5V,We used these for our ultrasound photos to try and preserve them and it turned out great! They are a little too big for the ultrasounds but it still works out.,5
B00004TS5V,"These are Great! I purchased these for my ultrasound pictures. As you all may know, if you've ever had a baby and received pictures, the paper is super thin. They're also very sentimental and you want to make sure they last for a lifetime obviously! Little tip ( in case you weren't aware)- this type of paper melts in a heat adhesive laminator machine so you have to use something like this instead! I'm So glad I did. These are awesome and now my pictures are protected and super sturdy. originally ordered 2 packs and just ordered two more (:",5
B00004TS5V,These are great . So easy to use. I love them.,5
B00004TS5V,"I bought these specifically to preserve all of our ultrasound images for our baby! It is a pretty simple and easy process to use them, but I wish there were more size options because I did have to cut them down to match the ultrasound image size.",5
B00004TS5V,Love these heatless laminating pouches for homemade recipe cards. They are also great for preserving ultrasound photos and other photos. I always keep a stack on hand.,5
B00004TS5V,So incredibly easy to use for quick lamination,5
B00004TS5V,I got these to laminate my inspection sticker and registration because I have tints and works really good.,5
B00004TS5V,A bit expensive but very nice,5
B00004TS5V,I purchased these to laminate my ultrasounds and I absolutely love this. Just be very careful when laminating and take your time in order to avoid bubbles,5
B00004TS5V,"This is the second time I have purchased this product, though it is a smaller size than the last one. They are easy to use, and are great for Medicare cards that are only paper and could get destroyed in a wallet or get wet. These protect those paper cards as well as pictures, or any other item that you want to protect.",5
B00004TS5V,Perfect size to save my babys ultrasound pictures!,5
B00004TS5V,Perfect for what we needed.,5
B00004TS5V,I used these for my ultrasound pictures & I love them! I will definitely order more in the future for more things!,5

B000YZ8RGA,Daughter uses these to cut up her tshirts,5
B000YZ8RGA,I used the scissors to cut fur fabric to cover a bench. The fur fabric is a little thicker than typical fabric and the scissors cut good and didn't hurt my hand. Great value for the price.,5

B000YZ8RGA,"Cuts all types of fabrics, delicate and thick ones too. Would recommend selling with carrying case",5
B000YZ8RGA,"I finally needed to replace my old sewing scissors. I don't have a lot of money, so I was looking for something cheap, but that would still be effective cutting fabric. This definitely does the job and much better than I expected! It's cut through chiffon, cotton, fleece, and even coutil! This is the best price I've seen for scissors of such quality. I also always need to buy scissors that are suitable for left handers. These feel really comfortable in my left hand even for prolonged time. I really like the color too and the white hasn't got too dirty yet. the rubber also hasn't peeled off at all, unlike my last pair of scissors. Can't go wrong with Singer either. I definitely trust this brand. If you're on a budget, I highly recommend these as your next sewing scissors.",5
B000YZ8RGA,Oh yes these scissors cut fabric! I use them all the time. Great for crafting and customizing my family's t shirts! Keep on clippin,5

B000YZ8RGA,Works well,4
B000YZ8RGA,"This is exactly what I was looking for to cut through a pair of denim jeans. The cut was very smooth and easy. Definitely worth it to purchase, and I already own a strong pair of scissors but they couldn't cut through denim  smoothly.",5
B000YZ8RGA,These are okay craft scissors for paper or string... They are not so great for cloth. Maybe I got a dull pair; it kept snagging as I was trying to cut my fabric. I was expecting it to be smooth like a hot knife through butter and it absolutely was NOT.,2
B000YZ8RGA,I used these to cut shirts and it works great!,5
B000YZ8RGA,Update: Manufacturers reached out to me and offered a refund. I was able to use gloves and a Clorox wipe to clean off the orange gunk.My scissors came with this disgusting orange stuff all over it. It looks like food. Before I bought the scissors it said that I could return it. Now that I have them I can not return or replace them.,3
B000YZ8RGA,"So comfortable, cuts fabric like butter! This is my favorite pair of scissors!",5
B000YZ8RGA,Nothing special but they do the job,5
B000YZ8RGA,"Good scissors, felt comfortable and they are sharp.",5

B000YZ8RGA,"May be good for paper but won't cut through two pieces of fabric sewn together which is what I needed. I had to ""saw"" through the fabric using the part of the scissors close to the hinge. Onky good for paper.",2
B000YZ8RGA,I needed a new pair and these work great.,5
B000YZ8RGA,Cannot beat these scissors for the price point,5
B000YZ8RGA,Love!,5
B000YZ8RGA,"nothing like a new pair of fabric scissors. works great, great price.",5
B000YZ8RGA,This product cuts through fabric and really anything fast and easy. They also have a nice rubber padding inside so you finger won't hurt as much as they do when you use regular scissors.,5
B000YZ8RGA,"Great pair of fabric scissors, super reasonably priced.",5
B000YZ8RGA,Color is nice. Used for sewing.,5
B000YZ8RGA,"Exactly what 8 was expecting. They seem very sturdy, are sharp and comfortable not heavy to hold, and make cutting easy.  Defiantly worth the money spent.",5
B000YZ8RGA,"delivered quickly, easy to open packaging, and cuts through fabric incredibly cleanly !! i'm very pleasantly surprised, especially for the price. i bought this to modify some old clothes to fit me better and i'm not good at it by any means, but the results have been awesome.",5
B000YZ8RGA,only wish a left handed option was available.,5
B000YZ8RGA,LightweightEasy to useDid not cramp handsDurable,5
B000YZ8RGA,Love the color red.Handle is comfortable to use.Cuts fabric like a dream.Will buy again most definitely.,5
B000YZ8RGA,Someone gave me a pair of Singer scissors..  I liked them so well that I ordered another pair....I make yarn dolls and I need a pair of scissors that will cut through yarn for arms and skirt tail...These scissors will cut 20 string of yarn at a time....Sure is time saving.... I love it,5
B000YZ8RGA,Comfortable scissors I like them very much. Very durable value for money,5
B000YZ8RGA,Ok for basic use.,4
B000YZ8RGA,I use this work on fabric project. It light weight and comfortable to use.,5
B000YZ8RGA,"Bought these to cut ribbon for a wreath, but they're not very sharp. Disappointed in Singer.",3
B000YZ8RGA,Very strong and great at cutting the fabric. It is very long which allows you to cut straight and not junky. The scissors allow me to work faster and are very easy to use .,5
B000YZ8RGA,"These are what I bought for a one time project. If I was doing more than that I would have returned them and upgraded to something else. It seems that they only cut well the first couple inches of the scissors if you open them really wide. I found that the closer to the top I tried to go the less grip and cutting ability it had. Tolerable for kids or small things, but not big projects.",4
B000YZ8RGA,They are perfect nice and sharp love them,5
B000YZ8RGA,"I was working on a small craft project and thought I could just use any scissors to cut cloth.  After a nightmare struggle of 30 minutes, I gave up and bought this on Amazon in defeat.  I am happy to report these scissors will save you frustration and cut cloth like butter.  Highly recommended!",5
B000YZ8RGA,"Great product, price, shipping, communication, packaging. Highly recommend",5
B000YZ8RGA,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These scissors cut cotton well. I like the shape, though the flat side could be a little flatter. They fit in my hand well.",5
B000YZ8RGA,Cleanly cuts through fabric with ease! Only been using it for a week on some lighter fabrics so can't say how it is with heavier stuff.,5
B000YZ8RGA,Satisfied with the way they work.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"As a first time Cricut user it seemed like the ""accessories"" for the Cricut were just getting more and more expensive. My ""hobby"" was becoming very costly. Therefore, when I saw these off name brand mats for a much cheaper price I decided to give them a try. I am happy I did. The different levels of adhesion...strong, standard, and light are definitely accurate.  There is a definite difference between them. As a new user I accidentally put scrapbook paper on the standard mat and it was much harder to remove then when I did it later on the light mat. I haven't used name brand mats so I can't really compare them; however, these mats get the job done. They are easy to use. They fit nicely into my Cricut Maker 3.  The standard mat works great with my vinyl. It holds it in place, but releases when I want to remove the image I have cut. I would purchase these again without hesitation. You get more for your money. I need to research online how to clean them off without ruining them because I do get little pieces of lint and dust on them. I pick off what I can but I am sure there is a proper way to clean these. So overall, these 12x12 mats serve my needs and I have been able to create lots of cute things with them.",5
B08B4H3WWK,Really sticky!,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I found this to be a very affordable alternative to use with my Cricut machine, was delivered super fast since same day was available in my area, very convenient :)",5
B08B4H3WWK,"I'm using them but they are already not sticking well. I have not had them more than a few months. They are a good price don't smell, the right size but quality is lacking.",4
B08B4H3WWK,"I'm very happy with these mats.  I'm new to Cricut as I was using the Scan N Cut before and those mats are really expensive.  I haven't used the mats that much yet, but they seem to work great.  I'm actually thinking of ordering three more, so I will have backups.",5
B08B4H3WWK,"You can never have enough of these mats! They are the same as Cricut brand, just less expensive!",5
B08B4H3WWK,Amazing quality and half the price of Cricut brand.,5
B08B4H3WWK,As advertised,4
B08B4H3WWK,My first time using the cutting mat and I am please so PLUS they come in 4 with some really cool colors,5
B08B4H3WWK,These are perfect description was perfect delivery was perfect I would buy again if I need to,5
B08B4H3WWK,Great Quality,5
B08B4H3WWK,they always work great for me,5
B08B4H3WWK,I am happy with my purchase.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Why would I buy name brand when this is just as good. All three matts had an equal or better stick than my basic Cricut matts so do yourself a favor and save a couple extra $ for some vinyl <3,5
B08B4H3WWK,"Comparable to Circuit brand, slightly cheaper feeling. But for the price, it's worth it.",4
B08B4H3WWK,A great value and does what I need,5
B08B4H3WWK,Love these mats that are great replacements for Circuit and they fit even better I think.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"Anyone who knows about craft cutting machines knows that cutting mats are disposable and wear out over time. These mats are good quality for the price and hold up well to the wear and tear we put on them. I have ordered from this company several times and the last order I thought had a problem that turned out was just a slightly awkward lack of my own examination of the product and the manufacturing not punching the hanging holes completely out of the mats. After contacting the company who offered to make it right, I realized that with a little pressure they popped right out. :D So everything is 1000% good in my books!",5
B08B4H3WWK,Exactly what I thought,5
B08B4H3WWK,The items work very well,5
B08B4H3WWK,Works really great! Glad it found it!!,5
B08B4H3WWK,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These mats are a great deal. The combo comes with mats for different tasks. Also it's the best deal on price for this many mats. I'm very happy with this items.,5
B08B4H3WWK,These mats worked great with my Cricket designs.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I love these huge mats,",4
B08B4H3WWK,Veryyy good product,5
B08B4H3WWK,The sheets worked great. Just as sticky as name brand.,5
B08B4H3WWK,These work great and are cheaper than the real deal.,5
B08B4H3WWK,These mats were perfect. Work just like the cricut mats at a cheaper price. I would purchase again.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Just a bit too sticky when you first use them.  Be careful or you will tear your project.  After a bit of use they are just right.  They work well.,4
B08B4H3WWK,Perfect! These are my favorite ones. Ordered several others and come back to these.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I like the fact that the new mats are 24"" long, which accommodated my needs for my Cricut projects.",5
B08B4H3WWK,Works great with my cricut maker 3,5
B08B4H3WWK,Who would of thought this would work much better than name brand. I'm amazed how well they stick and are easy to use. they seem to be lasting a while now. Will order soon,5
B08B4H3WWK,Great price and works better than my cricut mats.,5
B08B4H3WWK,They work just like the cricut brand. And much cheaper !,5
B08B4H3WWK,Love great quality best value,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I got these to use in my new cricut. Chose them because of the reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. They worked well and held the paper in place.",5
B08B4H3WWK,Better price and the mat is just as good as the original.,5
B08B4H3WWK,These are so easy to use they fit my cricket maker 3 perfectly great value for the money makes cutting so much easier as well as picking and weeding thank you so much will buy again,5
B08B4H3WWK,Mats are the perfect level of stickiness. Fits my older model Cricut perfectly,5
B08B4H3WWK,I need the firm mat for some thin basswood I was cutting. It worked great. I'll also use the others for scrapbooking so it was a good deal to purchase this set as opposed to the more expensive brand name. Very happy with this purchase.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"These are fine, just comes with sticky crap all over the front. I guess it's meant to keep things from sliding around, but I hate it!",3
B08B4H3WWK,Works better then the one that came with my loklik,5
B08B4H3WWK,This worked just as well as the cricut mats with my cricut explorer.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I am tired of over paying for the Scan-n-Cut mats. The price is ridiculous! I decided to purchase these are try them out over my old mats. It worked!Simply trim these mats down to the 12x12"" grid. Use some 8 1/2x11"" double sided sticky sheets (like double sided tape but larger). I used one full sheet and cut another up to fill in the rest of the 12x12"" mat. I lined it up on top of my old mats grid and burnished really well.I have used these for weeks now without any issues. You will have to do test cuts to check for cutting depths as all your old settings will not be the same. So far my double sided sticky sheets have held on well. When I need a new mat I will simply remove the old one, scrape off the sticky sheet with Goo Gone and reapply a new sheet over my old one. Ta-da!Why pay all that $$$ ???",5
B08B4H3WWK,"Good mat, but wears out too fast",3
B08B4H3WWK,These are so so cutting mats. There are better cutting mats available. Doesn't hold stickyness very long.,3
B08B4H3WWK,Nice price and product.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Did the job in the beginning but even the strong stick gets unsticky quickly making it difficult to use long term.,3
B08B4H3WWK,"I love the performance of grip, easy to use, fits paper and cricut perfectly, labeled for grip. Perfect performance and appearance of application. Great value for the money. It does comes with a clean clear protection sheet to protect against dust and debris.",5
B08B4H3WWK,These work just as well as the official Cricut mats for a fraction of the price! I would definitely buy this brand again.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I bought these to replace the one that came with my cricket machine. They stick well, are easy to use, and keep clean. Great value, and is much cheaper than buying them in craft stores or even Walmart.",4
B08B4H3WWK,haven't used hem yet but seem as good as Cricut brand.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Really good quality,5
B08B4H3WWK,The stickiness is great! made creating projects fast and efficient,5
B08B4H3WWK,It was excellent just what I expected,5
B08B4H3WWK,Used for card stock and when pulling off the paper it grips strongly and tears. Using the standard grip mat it lifted the adhesive off the mat and onto the paper. Using the Light grip mat it is still to strong and you have to pull hard to remove the paper. This also left the paper feeling sticky.,3
B08B4H3WWK,Works well,5
B08B4H3WWK,"Second time I have purchased this, works good",5
B08B4H3WWK,"Honestly just as good as the Cricut brand for way less.  Didn't know what to expect but figured worth a shot for the price.  I will, most certainly buy these again next time I need them.",5
B08B4H3WWK,"This was a good price, and delivered fast.  The quality is very good, I have already used several pleased.",5
B08B4H3WWK,Works great with a circut machine! You can't beat the price! Would totally buy again.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I use mostly Cardstock and some vinyl. After a few days of using these, the stickiness started wearing off. So, as usual, I cleaned them and let them dry, and it did nothing. My Cardstock moves around while cutting. Seriously, only got a few days out of them. I was trying to find a cheaper alternative to the circuit brand, but I guess you get what you pay for.",2
B08B4H3WWK,"These work great!!  When they need replaced, I'll be buying these again.",5
B08B4H3WWK,Perfect!,5
B08B4H3WWK,They were very reasonable. Worked great and came quickly,5
B08B4H3WWK,As described.,5
B08B4H3WWK,These are sturdy ...they comes with a nice sticky  surface to keep your vynl in place....sharp nice clean cut.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Got these to replace my more expensive mats that had lost their tackiness.These are more affordable and are just as durable as the higher priced mats.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Love these if you keep them clean they will last for months!,5
B08B4H3WWK,These are great for the first and second time. They bend very easily and lose their stickiness very quickly.,2
B08B4H3WWK,The standard mat is very sticky.  Several pieces of the material I was working with (cricut vinyl) is so stuck that I can't even remove all of it.,2
B08B4H3WWK,These mats work perfect for larger HTV projects! Great price too!,5
B08B4H3WWK,"Too sticky for ""standard grip"". Tore up my vinyl trying to remove and ruined mat. Don't brayer anything onto it or it won't come back up. Ima stick with cricut mats, even tho that goes against my nature. However quality over quantity in this case.",3
B08B4H3WWK,I had some glitter htv that was extremely curled from being on a roll. Before I got these I would have to use tape to hold it down. I tried the stong grip mat and it held on to it like nothing the entire cut. Extremely happy with them and I hope they last a long time.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"Adhesive was sticky and product showed up undamaged.  Shipping took longer than I expected, but overall satisfied with my purchase.",5
B08B4H3WWK,"It's so worth it. I'm a new crafter and cut my new cricut brand mats up quite a but during my initial learning phase. I was looking for cutting mats and decided to try these out. My explorer air reads them the same, and don't have an issue with adhesion. I clean them with soap and water with a non abrasive sponge and air dry and they clean up very nicely. In between uses baby wipes keep it clean. Definitely worth every cent and I'll be purchasing the 12 x 24 mats from this seller soon! Nothing negative to say about it.",5
B08B4H3WWK,"I have an Etsy shop where I'm constantly using the standard grip mats. I hated having to fork out money for branded ones, so I got this pack months ago. They do lose stick after a while, but I've been able to extend their life and rotate them between materials. I won't go back to Cricut brand! I will say that they start pretty strong, so be careful with paper.",4
B08B4H3WWK,I debated between cricut brand and other brands when I first purchased my machine. I love these mats! I was shocked how much these maintained their stickiness even with how much I have used them.,5
B08B4H3WWK,Love it,5
B08B4H3WWK,"Nothing to dislike half the price of actual cricut mats,for the same quality if not better!",5
B08B4H3WWK,I am very surprised by these mats.  I was a little leery about the quality based on the price but I am pleasantly surprised!  You are definitely getting a bang for your buck with these mats!,5
B08B4H3WWK,Super sticky and hard to remove material off the mats.,3
B08B4H3WWK,I love them the strong grip is no joke.. they are amazing just gotta figure out how to clean mine,5
B08B4H3WWK,Prompt delivery.  Product exactly what I ordered.,5
B08B4H3WWK,"I have been using them for around a year and still the adhesive is still in great shape. I've used them for deep cutting projects, for light cutting projects and for print to cut projects, they work great for the projects I can do on my Air 2.It's a great value for the price.",5
B08B4H3WWK,Definitely recommend these mats!,5
B08B4H3WWK,I wanted to make cards and really needed a light grip mat but also wanted an extra medium grip and strong grip. This worked great.,5
B08B4H3WWK,These mats work just like the standard-grip mats put out by Cricut at a fraction of the price.Would recommend!,5
B08B4H3WWK,Not sticky enough when wipe it with damp baby wipe a few times stickiness is gone,3
B019SC4JV6,"I switched to this from creative memories tape runners because they are a lot cheaper and work just as good. If I place a photo or embellishment down and need to adjust it, I can easily lift it up and move it and it will still re-stick and hold.",5
B019SC4JV6,These little glue strip applicators are great. Very easy to use once you get the hang of it (sticky side down). They adhere objects such as photos down well. The cost is great. This pack of 8 was the same price as a two pack at my local store. Having 8 allowed me to immediately put one in my purse to have wherever I go and still have several at home.,5
B019SC4JV6,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Same product refill number different name. If you're like me and had the old version of Adtech Crafters tape ""permanent"" this fits!Easy install although a little fiddling for it to snap in versus the original one, but not bad at all. Same quality stickiness! My favorite tape ever and I've tried lots.My bestie gave me all of hers from years ago and I finally ran out. The price is excellent, no point in driving and wasting gas money or wait in line to pick this up only to pay more, lol. So worth it. Thank you!",5
B019SC4JV6,I use these for card making. Easy to refill,5
B019SC4JV6,I love this adhesive tape. I am taking a star away because it HAS to be used on a flat surface and with enough pressure otherwise there is a huge loss of product,4
B019SC4JV6,I purchased this double sided tape and didn't know what to expect. I must say that I'm very pleased with it. I ran through it so quickly because I was working on several projects everyday so I opted to try a different brand that had more tape on the spool. I was very displeased with the other product so I bought more of this brand. I love it! It has great hold and it's comfortable in my hand. I wish there was more tape on the spool though. I'm sticking to this tape though. It's the best!,5
B019SC4JV6,Such a great replacement pack! Works great and exactly what I was looking for.,5
B019SC4JV6,AdTech 05674 Permanent Crafter's Tape sticks things together like glue but with out the mess.,5
B019SC4JV6,I really like this tape because it lasts longer than just the two things in a pack and I go through a lot of tape,5
B019SC4JV6,This glue is absolutely amazing,5
B019SC4JV6,"I like this product a lot, but it's pricey. This is why I use it as sparingly as possible when I'm making cards. I recently ordered these refills and one of them is defective.  It doesn't roll right so I'm having to finess thesticky part off of it so as not to lose it.  First time this has ever happened.",3
B019SC4JV6,"I love the product but it's packaged differently each time.  Sometimes the rolls come in nice little comparments.  This time they came in one plastic sealed bag.  If you handle these wrong, the tape can come out.  I would rather they came in seperate packaging or in a seperate sections in cardboard",4
B019SC4JV6,I repeat purchase these they are a bit pricey for me and this is the 2nd package some of the tapes come broken making them unusable. They do work fine if they're not defective. The manufacturer should check for defects like this. Since now Amazon requires to return the package to get another one. I'll use the good ones and throw away the broken ones.,3
B019SC4JV6,I never have to lick another envelope and the refills are so easy to replace.  Works for all kinds of other projects.  It can replace double-stick tape on lighter applications.  Very easy to use.,5
B019SC4JV6,"Discovering this tape has been a game-changer for my cardmaking and papercraft journaling. It is so much easier to apply precisely than glue, and much less messy. The adhesion is great - once stuck, I've not had a problem with things coming apart. If the backing gets pulled out of alignment, it can be more difficult to use, but that happens rarely. These refills fit perfectly in the tape runners they are designed for, and are very easily to implement and use. I would highly recommend these for crafters!",5
B019SC4JV6,"For those of us who do scrapbooking, these are a must!!",5
B019SC4JV6,"I use this tape all the time.  I discovered after a time that most tape runners - no matter the brand - have the same dispenser.  Regardless of the brand, they can all stick and not work at all.  I started buying this brand at Walmart.  However, they don't always have it in stock. I started buying it from Amazon and the price is cheaper.  I use a ton of it making my greeting cards.  So, I buy is in the packs of eight refills.  I save the dispensers and just refill them.  Works for me just fine. Very pleased. My last order I bought 3 packs which gave me 24 refills.  This order I bought just one pack.  Tombow glue is the only other item I use making my cards and other paper projects.",4
B019SC4JV6,Using this instead of a glue stick to mount photos.  Much less messy and way easier.,5
B019SC4JV6,"I only bought this because I saw it was $6 cheaper than at Michaels where i go when I need something right away. There i paid $14 for the same and here i paid about $8 so the price difference was big. When I saw it here on amazon, i thought I am going to buy it and save these, because they will get used. In this photo, I have used this glue to stick the cigar band around the soap. These are high quality glue you can count on.",5
B019SC4JV6,This is great adhesive for making cards. I only gave it 4 stars because every now and then I get a defective refill that bunches up and I end up having to waste product and throw away.,4
B019SC4JV6,My favorite taperunner refills.,5
B019SC4JV6,"I teach classes every month.  I like the adhesive when it works, but somehow my ladies have trouble with the tape unraveling.  It is a pain to have to stop teaching and pull apart the dispensor and rewind the tape.It happens 2-3 times a class.  I buy in large quantity, so I have a bunch left.  I will use the balance, then switch to a different brand. Sorry!",3
B019SC4JV6,"Bought a glue tape tool at Hobby Lobby, ran out just before Christmas. Got this set of eight, and they're super easy to replace in the holder. The tape works well, isn't dry. If you get a little tape in the wrong place, you can rub it off, like rubber cement.",5
B019SC4JV6,The refills that I needed! Works Great!,5
B019SC4JV6,I use this for scrapbooking and sending off my wedding envelopes! Best idea ever!,5
B019SC4JV6,very sticky and keeps things bonded. Glue builds up where it comes out and you need to keep it cleaned off so the whole thing won't stop working. I have had a couple that at some point came out unevenly and I could not rewind it so lost the rest of the tape on the roll.,5
B019SC4JV6,I have found that approximately 1 in 5-7 refills is defective and not useable. The glue strips are not wrapped correctly. I use a lot of glue refills when making cards and am very disappointed in the quality of this product. athey are rather expensive so when one doesn't work it is very frustrating.,2
B019SC4JV6,"First of all, this came up in a search for ""glue DOTS AdTech refills"". And if I recall, glue dots was mentioned in the product listing.When I received these, I was horrified to learn that they weren't dots, but one continuous STRINGY strip of tape that acts more like booger glue than simple tape. They srsly need to revamp this formula, because I had tape strings all over my surface and projects. Very poor quality.",1
B019SC4JV6,"I use it for pictures, items, and paper. Work efficiently and effortlessly.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I have used this adhesive in card making and found it to be very effective. It adheres together pieces of 60-100lb card stock, jewel and pearl embellishments to cards, buttons or fancy borders of paper, ribbon and lace to cards, as well as paper and cloth like flowers and chipboard embellishments along with everything else I use to spiffy up my cards. The pieces do not fall apart or fall off. Sometimes I can remove them if I am very careful, but many times I have ripped the underlying paper trying to get the glued item off. (it reminds me to think ahead! lol) It is nice to lay down the adhesive in a strip along the edges to get a nice bond. If I get some adhesive where I don to want it, i can eraser it off or just use my fingers to roll it up and off. I like that these are refills, which saves money. The price is good compared to other rolled adhesives. I have reordered this set because I like it that much. I would definitely recommend it for card making. I have not tried it on other types of crafting.",5
B019SC4JV6,This has been my favorite but to from $8 and some change to over $14 for 8 refills is too much!,5
B019SC4JV6,"These tape refills are easy to swap in and out. They are also about $1 each, so they are much cheaper than buying new dispensers with the same tape. I will continue to buy this pack to make my paper crafts and save some money!",5
B019SC4JV6,I love this craft tape runner! They make scrapbooking so easy. I've ordered multiple times. Can't beat the price for these refills.,5
B019SC4JV6,"Works so much better than glue sticks for school projects, making cards, scrapbooking, etc. Love this product! Easy to use and incredible hold!",5
B019SC4JV6,Easy to use and very sticky adhesive,3
B019SC4JV6,"Bought these to make photo books for my kids. Worked so well, affordable and is so much faster than using regular tape! Will be buying more!!",5
B019SC4JV6,Use these all the time. Work well.,4
B019SC4JV6,"I just started using ADtech a few weeks ago.  I am impressed with the hold strength.  I was previously using Tombow runners and was having some items fall off.  So far I have had zero issues with Adtech.  I also gambled and was ecstatic that it fit the holder for Darice and Sticky Thumbs (lime green) cases.  I also read that it fits Elmers but I can't find mine right now. It did not fit my discontinued Surebonder runner although it was CLOSE.  I think I am sold on Adtech refills.  I love the cost, I love that it comes in an 8 pack since most come in 3 packs which I blow through quickly.  Also I also prefer that there is less plastic waste in these refills compared to the Tombow.",5
B019SC4JV6,I have used this tape runner for years an never had a problem but the last box I bought this month had 4 out of the eight came apart ??? Sorry forgot to get pictures so I was disappointed I e mailed the company but they never got back to me so I had to order another hope it will be ok,3
B019SC4JV6,"When I made this year's Christmas cards, I used this ""crafter's tape"" to stick slippery photographs to shiny cardstock, and it held very tenaciously.  I don't doubt that the length specified on the package is correct, but as other reviewers have noted, a cartridge does run out surprisingly fast.  To conserve tape, I used just a one-inch strip in each corner of a photograph, and that seemed to be quite sufficient.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I absolutely LOVE this product although it's more expensive than I think it ought to be. That said, I wish the refills and dispensers (not sold with the refills I'm reviewing) had more capacity. I use this Crafter Tape to create cards where I glue 24# paper inside heavier stock to display the greeting. The roll-on dry adhesive holds the paper in place, doesn't show through (or wrinkle) the paper and holds permanently. I also use it to affix photos, design papers and origami folds to the card fronts. It's easy to use but runs out too fast for what I'm doing. Still, 5 stars.",5
B019SC4JV6,"Easy to replace in the tape runner container, adheres well. Very reasonably priced.",5
B019SC4JV6,"Tape works well and rarely, if ever, has any issues. The refills are a good value too, compared to other ones. Lasts a good while too.",4
B019SC4JV6,"This worked fairly well for sticking larger items to my my cards. However, the glue on the strip did build up on the upper tip of the opening and I would have to clear it. Also, because of the build up, the glue did not apply smoothly, but instead came off the strip unevenly. This would start usually about 3/4s through the cartridge. It still worked much better for me than the thin tape on the large rolls.",4
B019SC4JV6,Ended up giving this a try with my Elmer's Reusable Tape Runner ran out...it fits in my great and also works just as good as Elmer's.  So much cheaper than Elmer's and works the same!!,4
B019SC4JV6,I use this on most of my card making. Love it.,5
B019SC4JV6,Fit my dispensor and works great!,4
B019SC4JV6,"I love Ad Tech tape refills.  The tape advances easily -- even at the end of each roll.  There is no gummy residue that gets stuck around the edges of the roller/dispenser which is what slows down other tape roller products I've tried.  The tape holds FIRMLY.  Be sure to carefully place your embellishments carefully the first time around because once you press it into place, you will destroy your paper project  trying to unstick it.  You can try removing your embellishment after pressing it in place with a cricut (or other brand) spatula.  I've done that a few times.  But an ounce of prevention (don't PRESS down till you're sure it's in the right place) is worth much more than trying to remove your embellishment with a spatula!",5
B019SC4JV6,"Good value, sticks well, easy to change refills",5
B019SC4JV6,"Works well, great value",5
B019SC4JV6,"I wish it came in a more narrow width as well, but I love this stuff for my card making and other paper crafts.",5
B019SC4JV6,I am a avid card maker and this double sided tape is a staple in my craft room,5
B019SC4JV6,Second time buying these work great,5
B019SC4JV6,"I like that this is a multi pack. When making a lot of cards, 1 roll is never enough. This product has always worked great for me.",5
B019SC4JV6,It is very handy and simple to use.  It also holds really well.  My daughter told me about it and I ordered 12 and have one in each room of my house just for the convenience of it.  A great buy!!,5
B019SC4JV6,Perfect tape for easy scrapbooking fun!!,5
B019SC4JV6,Love these for papercrafting,5
B019SC4JV6,"I hate running out of supplies, so I love that I can have a whole box of these so there is still something left after my son does his trifold board project!",5
B019SC4JV6,Product arrived quickly and works great. My only dislike is the cost. It is a bit more expensive but it works great.,4
B019SC4JV6,I have tried many different glue runners and AdTech is by far my favorite. This product is easy to use and easy to change out the replacement refills.  I had an issue with a box that I ordered and I reached out to the company and I have to say that they have amazing customer service. They apologized for the issue and sent me not 1 but 2 replacement boxes.,5
B019SC4JV6,"I have made my own greeting cards for years, usually involving adhering photos to cardstock. Initially, I used Staples brand equivalent to these AdTech adhesives, but the ones I bought at Staples, became more expensive and weren't always in stock, so I turned to these. I've been very pleased with the AdTech product.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I love this stuff. It makes card making so easy. My only complaint is that I probably go through an entire box making about 120 cards. If there were an option to purchase two dozen of these refills at a time I would be first in line to buy it. I have used other brands of ""snail"" in the past, but this is better than the expensive stuff and I will never use Tombo brand ""snail"" again. This is the ONLY brand to use.",5
B019SC4JV6,This is my favorite tape refills for my container.  goes on smooth and sticks really well. I use it for Card Making.,5
B019SC4JV6,"I make anywhere from 30 to 50 cards a month, most months, so I need a good inexpensive adhesive. This stuff lasts and I count it for my card-making. It hasn't failed me. Some of the TomBow refills have. The refills are easy to drop into their case. This is appreciated as I don't want to have to stop and fidget with anything, once I'm on a roll creating.",5
B019SC4JV6,"Although these tape refills can sometimes be hard to get to work, they are a great value. I have bought them numerous times and will continue to do so. You get enough in the package so that losing one or two isn't great, but tolerable.  Human error can be the problem, too.",4
B019SC4JV6,Easy to use,5
B019SC4JV6,good sfuff,5
B019SC4JV6,Worked perfectly for glitter paper wedding invitations; but need to buy a lot.  Doesn't go far.,5
B019SC4JV6,Not the best quality of dispensed tape. Not a sharp line of tape) but for the price totally worth it. Have ordered more than once.,4
B019SC4JV6,"I had used up my Adtech crafters tape and figured I would end up needing to buy new ones, but then I saw that these refills were available.  Have tried two so far and they fit perfectly and work well.You do have to manually advance the tape for about an inch at the beginning to get to the sticky part (which took me a moment to figure out), but once I realize what I had to do, it was easy.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I work in a classroom where we make various cards, so go through a lot of glue runners!! We have bought and tried quite a few different brands, and when we first bought these we were worried because the price was so low, but we were happily surprised!! These are by far the best glue runner refills that we have used! The go on smoothly, and we had no issues with them. Plus they stick even better the. Some of the more expensive brands. We have already bought more!! I would definite recommend them to anyone who is looking for this type of product!!!",5
B019SC4JV6,It worked great for sealing all our wedding envelopes! So happy to have refills to easily replace and not waste as much plastic too.,5
B019SC4JV6,Best tape for all my scrapbooking needs. I have used different tape and always come back to this one,5
B019SC4JV6,Only tape runner I will use for scrapping.,5
B019SC4JV6,Excellent quality. Easy refill. Less waste and more money saved. These are my go-to with ANY paper project/crafting.,5
B019SC4JV6,"This new box of refills AND the previous box ordered were all wound backwards. ALL are affected so none can be used successfully. I've ordered these since 2020 and didn't have a problem until my most recent 2 orders. I'll get reimbursed for the most recent order, BUT I cannot send back the previous order because it's past its return date. WON'T BUY AGAIN FROM AMAZON! I'D RATHER GO BACK TO TOMBOW!",1
B019SC4JV6,"Is exactly what it says. Works great, easy to replace. Well packaged. I plan on purchasing again.",5
B019SC4JV6,"Love these for card making. Reliable, consistent quality. Works well with most types of paper and card stock. Haven't tried on glittery paper yet which can be a hassle to get other stuff to stick to. I bought this because mom likes it and as usual, she's right.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I love how easy it is to use. It also super fast to put the refills in. I use it for math notes, to glue in graphs. I also use it for my journal and scrapbook. It is sticky enough to keep stuff on, but if you really need to remove it, then it's not too sticky.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I have been using this product for years for my scrapbooking and card making. Since I go through so many of them, I appreciate being able to save a little by using refills.",5
B019SC4JV6,"I would usually give 5 stars but lately the spools have been coming off and it becomes unusable.  Sometimes I can fix it enough to use it but when both spools break off it's a waste. I will have to start using a different brand. Sad for as expensive these are, they break.",2
B019SC4JV6,"I first bought this adhesive from hobby lobby and thought it was great. Decided to buy the refills from Amazon to save me the long drive to the store but I wonder now if that was a mistake. The adhesive isnt as strong, doesn't adhere properly and is very stretchy, so every time I pull away there's adhesive still on the roller. This was not an issue before.",3
B005FM6XF4,"I, like others here, thought halfway through the first roll that I got a bum product, tossed it and moved on to the second roll in the pack only to find that, again, halfway through, the roll stops going on evenly or at all and you have to press hard to get it to work and the paper bunches up inside the cartridge. Well, I opened it up to see what the issue could be and figured out how to make it work like new again.First, pop it open and take out the cartridge. You may notice that the back roll is full of paper that goes beyond the confines of the plastic lip. (Sorry I don't have a picture of it before I fixed it.) It's literally overflowing. This is your used paper. Pop the spool out from the back by pressing gently from behind.Tear this paper and set the rest of the cartridge aside. You're going to remove all this dead paper and throw it away. Once it's empty take a look and feel around the back of the spool, the side with the hole blocked off. Is it all sticky? Use some alcohol on a qtip to remove this built up adhesive. Then, use your qtip to also clean the gunk from around the area where this spool contacts the cartridge. This is what's bogging down your tape!Once it's all clean, time for the kinda tricky part. Look on the tape and figure out where the adhesive starts again. Roll the tape forward a little past the rubber tip and then make a line on some paper. The result you're looking for is about a centimeter of glue and then a gap of like 2 inches. It's tricky the first time, sorry. Use this to reattach the tape to the clean back spool. Roll it up tightly til the paper is all wound up.Now, you can pop the spool back into the cartridge and the pop the cartridge back into the case. You should find it to be as good as new again.Good luck with it! Awesome product with a great price. Don't let the reviews of uncreative quitters fool you.",5
B005FM6XF4,"This is a very good tape, and I purchased it several times.  However, the last few times I got it, the tape runners sometimes do not work and roll the tape properly.  It is also getting very expensive - every time I look it has gone up in price.  I used to get it for about $50 for the case and today it is up to $76!!  I realize things are going up, but I can't keep buying it at the continued increase in price.",5
B005FM6XF4,"I thought I had gotten a faulty product. This was unfortunate since I had purchased two packs of 4. I tried to use them time and time again and would get half a sheet of glue, or the glue would stick up the end of the runner and then gunk up the tape. It was a mess! It's all about the technique with how you hold and use the glue tape dispenser!You must hold the tape dispenser straight on the paper. With even pressure and a bit of a heavy hand, pull straight towards yourself in an even motion and you will lay down a straight even line of adhesive. I don't know why I had such a learning curve with this or why I seemed to find this difficult. I've been using these tape runners for years. This particular brand had just slightly a difference to the feel for it in my hand which made me have to reteach myself how to properly hold and use it.After some practice, I got it down and it works perfectly. They feel a little bit cheaply made like I'm going to break it if I apply some pressure in my grip while holding it, but it lays down some quality, permanent adhesive. When I say permanent, you better hope to not move what you're taping down.These are acid-free and great for scrapbook and all paper crafting. I especially love using my for my planner and attaching pages together that I may have goofed up or for frankenplanning. These are also great when you want to attach something little and being that it's permanent you can attach almost anything to everything paper related.Overall, I think this a great product and a good bang for your buck. Over 26ft of tape x 4 tape runners in one box is a phenomenal investment in all your crafting needs.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I use this crafting tape instead of sticky glue. Whether it's scrapbooking, taping photos, taping paper, it's perfect. It is easy to use, highly adhesive, easy to tape corners without a mess, and it quicker and cleaner than most other tapes or glues. You also cannot see the remnants of the tape under the taped product. For example, if you were to glue down a piece of paper onto another piece of paper, with liquid Elmer's glue you would see where you put the glue but with this crafters tape, you do not see a thing.IMPORTANT:If you are using for scrapbooking photos, be aware that once you adhere the photo to a piece of paper for example, and then later decide to take the photo off, it will most likely tear the paper (which is fine if you plan to cover it with another photo) and warp the photo BUT if you are gluing the photo back down, you will be fine. There will also be glue remnants on the back of the photo once you remove it so keep that in mind.",5
B005FM6XF4,I use these a lot. Works great and will order again when needed,5
B005FM6XF4,"When I scrapbook, I go through a lot of this tape. I wanted to find the best deal that would give me a pack of this tape. This brand has been nothing short of amazing and I will continue to buy from them!",5
B005FM6XF4,This is my favorite adhesive tape for card making. Goes on easy and sticks well.,5
B005FM6XF4,It sticks very well,5
B005FM6XF4,Works great,5
B005FM6XF4,"I bought this brand because I can no longer find my usual brand. This is awful - the glue doesn't roll solid, it breaks apart in pieces and strings as you pull it off the paper and then, it takes the paper with it. The glue is good in itself because it tears all the wrap except the very thick. Very difficult to work with.",2
B005FM6XF4,Described,5
B005FM6XF4,"You can never have enough glue runners. This pack is amazing, and the bundle came with more then enough refills to craft my heart out. Love this!!",5
B005FM6XF4,This is my favorite tape runner.  It's a great adhesive for it's price point. The cartridges rarely jam.,5
B005FM6XF4,"I purchased two kinds of tape runners for my paper crafts.  The AdTech are, by far, the better of the two, plus they had more tape per roll than the other brand.",5
B005FM6XF4,"This is one of the stickiest products I have come across and I have used a few.  I don't use these for what would considered a typical use.  I use these to stick desiccant bags inside of seal electronics.  In my opinion it's the best since it's cheap and sticky, but requires some experience to dispense.1. Wrap a piece of tape around the dispenser plastic.  They tend to split apart easily, especially if it falls from a workbench to a concrete floor.  At this price, it doesn't even make sense to buy refills so don't worry about having to get it apart again.2. The tape does not always come off evenly, so be careful.  It can either stay stuck to the carrier paper or the tape is so strong along the length it will tend to pull more adhesive off after you pick it up.  It does not always break off cleanly.  A little angle tilt and a quick jerk tends to make a cleaner end.",4
B005FM6XF4,Great value.  Strong hold,5
B005FM6XF4,"This stuff is great! I'm not a ""crafter,"" per se, but I did want to adhere engagement photos, cards, and RSVPs into a scrapbook for us. This stuff worked great. It does clump up a tiny bit, but nothing too terribly bad. If you put the tape on something and drop that something in the wrong place, beware! This stuff is sticky and isn't very forgiving when it comes to needing to move something around. I was taping RSVP cards and drop one with the tape on the back of it. In removing it, it peeled up the scrapbook parchment. They're not kidding around when they say ""permanent.""There is one important thing to note for us ""non crafters."" I could not tell when the canister was empty. All of a sudden there wasn't any tape coming out; it was just slick. I had not paid attention to which side the tape had been initially. I am posting a photo of what the canisters look like full versus empty. Look at the larger wheel to know when you're out of tape. Hopefully this will help others. Great product! I just ordered two ore boxes of 4, as I have a lot of taping up to do! :-)",5
B005FM6XF4,"Got the 4 pack of these.  Unfortunately when I went to use one, I discovered that it had not been assembled properly.  The glue strip was not threaded through the applicator, so could not be used at all.  I checked the other three, which all seemed to be properly assembled.  I tried one of them and it worked quite well!Unless someone advises me of an easy fix for the bad one, I guess I am forced to return or exchange the 4-pack. I will upgrade my rating after I get a fix or replacement.2/26/21I started the return process via Amazon.  I got a replacement at no charge, without returning old.  This more than makes things right in my opinion, so have revised my review from 2 to 4 stars.",4
B005FM6XF4,"So this is the 3rd or 4th time I've gotten these tape runners and they are pretty good for the price. They hold really nice on cardstock and other paper... for a time. I've found that the adhesive fails after a while if the project is left to sit for a while and I find myself having to go back a re-glue pieces. The tape runners are great for little projects or for kids crafts, but they don't work so well for those of us making large projects, greeting cards, etc. There are just so many other adhesives out there that work so much better for the same price or even cheaper! That being said, I do still highly recommend them to just have on hand for backups!",4
B005FM6XF4,Like the product but can't seem to get it.,3
B005FM6XF4,"Easy to use once you practice a few times, light pressure works best.  I used it to make small party favor boxes from 100 lb card stock.  When I checked the next day, about half of the boxes had come apart because the glue failed.  I had to use a different adhesive to fix them. Also there is less tape in the dispensers than some other brands.  I went through 4 dispensers in no time.",1
B005FM6XF4,"I love these tape runners, they are handier than doublesided tape and obviously work faster than glue (I have a bad habit of being an impatient crafter). I've tried many brands ranging from stampin up to tombow to elmer's and more, and these are my favorite tapes I've ever used - definitely the best value of any tape I've purchased, and they are really sticky!!! At first I was frustrated because it was tearing my paper, but after a couple tries I realized these guys require a bit of a lighter hand than similar tapes - don't press super hard, especially on thinner papers! Once I got the feel for these though, we were off to the races and now I'm obsessed. When these run out, I plan to buy again (and again and again).",5
B005FM6XF4,I always buy tombow but have to admit this adhesive is much stronger than it. Really like this adhesive and will continue to buy this brand.,5
B005FM6XF4,"I make my own cards and I started using this adhesive as I was having a bad time with others that would break while rolling or just wouldn't roll at all. I was using a different one recently at a card-making party and boy I felt embarrassed because I couldn't use the other well-known brand. It was definitely my technique because the others weren't having a problem with it. But I feel like you shouldn't have to have a technique to roll out this type of tape. The Adtech tape was simple to use from the get-go and it is sticky enough for paper on paper, sticking ribbon, sealing envelopes, etc. I like it and will try to always purchase this brand as long as the price is right!",5
B005FM6XF4,"I bought these to seal packs of seeds.  It was so sticky, i couldn't let it get anywhere off the paper.  I mean super sticky. And that was awesome because I could move quickly making my seed envelopes.  Fast forward 2-3 weeks.  I'm looking in my large bag of completed seed packets and I notice they are opening.  I pull one out and the glue has somehow lost it's stick.  All the seed packets that used this tape have opened.  They have been kept in my bedroom the entire time.  NOTHING should have caused them to open.  Now I have to carefully pull each one out of the sack and reseal them individually, again, with tape, before all my varieties of seeds end up in a massive pile at the bottom of the sack. I'm quite surprised the tape didn't stick after a few weeks since it was SOOOO sticky at the beginning.  Really surprised.  I won't be buying this product again.  Even the cheap glue stick kept those few  envelopes closed.  I thought for sure it would outlast the glue stick.  But no.  It didn't.",3
B005FM6XF4,love the amount I get,5
B005FM6XF4,I've used one completely and encountered this the whole time.  The tape/adhesive doesn't tear off like it should when you detach from your running piece of paper and it ends up sometimes stringing like a piece of melted cheese does... if you get that visual.  It can be annoying.  I don't know if adhesion will last as I've used it when making 3D paper Xmas ornaments and this was after using up a roll of the Tombow in the same type of running adhesion tape and comparing this product to that.  In the end.. I'll go back to Tombow.,4
B005FM6XF4,"I use this in my sketchbooks, sometimes I skip a page and draw on the back of the next page to create a picture that spans two pages. I skip a page because I use pens and markers that bleed through and leave a ghost image on the back of the page. I use this adhesive to combine the blank page that I skipped to the previous page so that when you flip through the book you don't see those. Works great for this, goes on easy with no mess, and is not thick as to interfere with the size of my sketchbook, this pack will last me a while, but I will buy it again when I run out.",5
B005FM6XF4,"I think the problem is user error but since I've never used this type of tape before I really don't know.  Sometimes it lays down really nicely.  Other times you can see large strips of it in the air rather than on the project.  Then when you press down and lift up it adheres to the project.  Sometimes it is a full strip and other times it's rather spotty.  Hopefully, as I go on I'll get better at using it.  If not, I'll try a different brand next time to see if it's me or the tape that is the problem.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I didn't know this existed until doing crafts one morning at a MOPS meeting. When it came time to add pictures to my daughter's baby book, I got on Amazon to order this right away. It was a great purchase because now the pictures are neatly attached to the pages. In fact, I'm going to redo the pictures in my oldest daughter's book.It's mess free and effortless to use. It's similar to using Wite-Out correction tape. I imagine this being a necessity for any scrapbooker. I went overboard with several pictures and applied tape to the entire back side but started to run out of tape fast. Then I switched to taping the perimeter of each picture and that worked just as well. Another product that makes my life easier!",5
B005FM6XF4,"4 in a pack for $7. You get what you paid for. If you use any Japanese/Korean glue tape it does not compare, but it's passable if you're on a budget and don't want to mess with regular glue. I mainly bought it because it's supremely cheaper than the Japanese/Korean brands. However, quality downgrades. Sticky enough to adhere light paper when journaling, but you have to use a bit more. It also doesn't cut off cleanly and you have to wrestle a bit with it. Can't complain with the price.",4
B005FM6XF4,"Sorry for the terrible title.I bought this for various crafts and school stuff that needed to stick. Glue can cause bumps and can lose its stickiness over time, I would never use glue on photos. Traditional tape is tacky, and can also leave bumps. Double sided sticky tape is difficult to store as everything sticks to it.This tape is enclosed and rolls out smoothly, making it much more convenient.The product says permanent, and it is! It sticks instantly and has an incredibly strong bond. Make sure you have the two things exactly where you want them, because they are not coming apart!It's smooth, and thin so there's no bumps.I haven't had any trouble with the roller, I found it easy to use.I will be buying more!",5
B005FM6XF4,I didn't have any problems at all so far with this product. I ordered the four pack and the eight pack refill. Refills are easy to replace and I appreciate not having to toss the plastic case! I realized that a little goes a long way and started using too much at first and quickly realized it wasn't necessary. It doesn't always roll perfectly and sometimes leaves a glob of glue at end but easy enough to clean up. Good price for these! I will order the refills again!,4
B005FM6XF4,I almost didn't purchase this pack of tape runners because of the bad reviews. I haven't had any problems with them. It took a tiny bit of learning how to use it but I haven't had any problems with the first one I used out of the pack of 4. I can't even get the white out tape pens to work well so...these pens work great haha.I haven't used any other brand of tape runner and maybe they're easier? But based off my usage and purpose  (card making) I would definitely purchase them again.,5
B005FM6XF4,Arrived on time and just what I needed! Thanks!,5
B005FM6XF4,"In hindsight, I should have purchased the refills as this brand is super easy to replace as long as you set them side by side and drop it in.  I did the math and it was $15 more for the luxury of not having to replace the rolls.  Either way as long as you use a gentle touch these do the job.",5
B005FM6XF4,The problem may have been mine as I used cheap dollar store construction paper as liners to my photos.  This glue tape tore up the paper and ate it and it rolled around the glue roll.  I had bought the Ad Tech Craft tape refills and inserted into the tape disperser and this worked better. These tapes are really strong and don't work well on construction paper. I was disappointed but hopefully I will be able to use them throughout the project. I can't give 5 stars as they are not working for my project at the moment.,4
B005FM6XF4,"Even the children in Sunday School like using this tape, no need to wait for glue to dry. Although we did run into a problem, it did not work well on construction paper, it would pick up fine bits of paper and attached to the roll as we rolled it across, similar to wiping a piece of tape across fabric.That problem was was easily resolved for us as we were taping regular paper to the construction paper, so we just switched which paper we put the tape on.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I use this tape for card-making and stamping. I've tried other ""bargain brands"" before and been very disappointed; but this one is great! It adheres very well and is comparable to much more pricey brands. Once in while, I've had a cartridge break before it was emptied, but that's rare. I have used this tape for about 2 years now. Great price for a great product.",4
B005FM6XF4,"Admittedly, this is the first time I've used this kind of adhesive, so I have no basis for comparison. But, for me, it worked just fine. It's sticky, it rolls fairly evenly and easily, and it's acid free. Since I'm using it to put together a memory book for my Mom's 80th birthday party, it suits my needs perfectly.The adhesive stretches a little when I stop the roll and pull away from the paper, but I suspect that's just a user error. There's probably some technique that stops this from happening that will come with practice. No biggie.",5
B005FM6XF4,"The tape, when it works, is awesome. Lays down evenly and smoothly, feels firm, excellent hold. But I've now had two of the eight that I bought (I ordered two packs) get the tape backing (the paper bit) stuck in a weird way so that it was coming out whenever I tried to roll in a line. Which was a bit like stepping on my own shoelace. I could roll about a cm of tape and then the paper would be under the roller and I wasn't doing anything. I tried taking one apart and rerolling the paper on the internal roll so that it was tight, but that only lasted for a couple of cards before I was right back to where I started.Just one I would have written off as a fluke, but when I had a second doing the same thing...",3
B005FM6XF4,"This may be helpful this may not, since some people have had bad experiences with it. I've already used 1 of them. They are super easy to use and way better than my other one, on my other one the tape wouldn't even come out (not on this product my other one) it's like tape but free roam almost, It sticks really good and I love it!",4
B005FM6XF4,"Wow!! Great price on these compared to what I paid when buying similar ones at the store.. Also, these stick much better than the other popular brand that I purchased before.. so glad that they do :) especially since i use it to seal envelopes and I've found that the other glue runner I used would eventually loose its seal on the envelopes but with this one the envelopes are staying sealed!! Yay! So therefore I gave 5 stars!!! These really are great for any project and not messy!!Hope this review helps ;)",5
B005FM6XF4,"These have worked great so far.  Have used them when making cards or decorations with my Cricut.  They just don't last long.  For the small size, that probably needs to be taken into consideration.  Just funny how big the dispenser is compared to how much tape you get out of them.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I purchased this pack to adhere Polaroid prints which are heavy into a paper photo book. This product was easy to dispense and held the prints to the book great. I was worried the glue would not be strong enough but it worked perfectly. I also glued heavy card stock using this glue to the front of the book. The glue worked well and I was not able to remove the glued photos, not even to move or preposition. Once you stick the photo it is permanent. This was for graduation, easy to use, no drying required and non-messy.",5
B005FM6XF4,"I was using this product to tape pictures in an album and putting about 1 to 2 strips of this tape on each picture.  I found that one roll of this using it this way does not last very long at all!  It adheres quite well, however.  The product itself is very good, but just not very much adhesive on one roll.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I am new to papercrafting and ordered this to have on hand for cardmaking.  The first time I used it didn't go so well.  I realize I will need a lot of practice with this to master its use.  It definitely shows and will pick up lint, etc. if not covered quickly and completely.  While I am sure my first attempt was my fault, I can see where this has to be used very carefully or I will experience the same results next time.  I ended up throwing the card and envelope I made away for a few reasons--this tape was one of those reasons.  It doesn't dry clear and stays sticky if not covered up.  Also, the dispenser didn't move very smoothly and I had to keep going over the same areas",3
B005FM6XF4,"This is my second purchase. The adhesive sticks really well, but I noticed that the dispenser doesn't apply very evenly/consistently so that less than half of the adhesive is applied on the paper. It still gets the job done, but it's a bit frustrating because I feel like I'm only getting half of what I paid for.  Not sure if I'll re-purchase from this brand, but I definitely like the idea, and I'm on the lookout for similar producst.",4
B005FM6XF4,"i use this for greeting cards and for my kids' school projects. it holds well and is a breeze to use. we've been through several packages of this in the last few months and have been very pleased with the results we've gotten, but have had a couple broken dispensers. - like all of a sudden the used tape starts coming out the front with the new tape instead of winding on its inside roller. i was able to fix a couple of them by taking them apart and reattaching the tape, but one was not able to be repaired.",5
B005FM6XF4,"I've recently started using this crafter's tape after trying two others. It works really well for most of my projects so far. However, it does clump (as other reviewers have noted) and I wouldn't use this tape on delicate or thin materials. It isn't easy to remove if you accidentally get it on your craft table either. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the product and will probably continue to buy/use.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I use this for card making and the price for how much you get is worth it.  I have had to throw a few away before they were empty because they broke.  It does get stringy, so I try to not lift it and keep it on the paper by turning it and not lifting the tape.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I have a love my ATG fun for almost everything I need to adhere, but these are a nice convenient smaller size, especially for travel and crops. My biggest issue is that there is not a lot of tape in these and there is a lot of waste involved in using this type of adhesive which is why I originally moved to the Scotch ATG gun.",4
B005FM6XF4,I got these in place of the big pink atg i got and couldn't load had too much hassle and trouble. I believe it was due to the  fact i am not that coordinated. and left handed. i love these little things already loaded. ready to go. they work wonderfully I was able to get through this seasons card making without a hassle. they're a better bargain then another brand i tried. you get more bang for your buck. I recommend these to others who have issues loading those big tape guns.,5
B005FM6XF4,"It does stick very well. But I find that no matter how I hold these or use them, they clog quite a bit. Maybe I just got an extra-goopy batch, but I have to pull clumps of adhesive away from the dispenser quite often. When I don't have to, though, they're spectacular, and the adhesive holds extremely well, especially after giving the application time to set when using. I do get tired of expecting a smooth application, then getting a blob instead (hence the 2 stars off the rating), but they do work very well when not clogging. And for the price, it's really not a bad deal. if you can tolerate a blob-clog now and then, definitely get this. If you're not patient enough for that, go for something better.",3
B005FM6XF4,"This adhesive tape works well on paper,",5
B005FM6XF4,"I love these glue tape dispensers! We do a lot of projects and I hate using glue, but I can't hardly find double sided tape. These dispensers are easy to use, but can be a little tricky. They are just like ""white out tape"", but you can't see the adhesive & it can get a little sticky at times. That being said, I'll take this over traditional liquid or stick glue any day! When applied, it does a great job adhering & it is very flat so the end result is great! I'll definitely be buying more of this product!",5
B005FM6XF4,"Serves its purpose. I carry one around with me for journaling on the go. The only downside would be that sometimes the tape doesn't come out evenly and it gets stuck, requiring a little bit more force. And it doesn't apply even all the time. But the adhesive is strong enough so even if it's not even, it holds up very very well.Only gone through half of the 4 set but will be definitely ordering more.",4
B005FM6XF4,"This glue tape roller is not easy to use as it actually sticks too well. What I mean is that the glue is so sticky it sticks to itself and is really difficult to 'tear' from the roller when you want it to stop. Once you get it to tear, it sticks great. Just not easy to use.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I bought this after watching a YouTube video on ways to personalize chip bags or snack bags. This is very sticky, so once it's down, it's down. I ripped a little of my page trying to pull some up. I went through all four rolls on one complete craft project. I ran out much quicker than expected. I opted to go a different route for double-sided tape to save money in the future.",3
B005FM6XF4,"I use these for a variety of projects.  I teach a craft class, and the ladies love these for many projects.  I also use these sometimes for attaching brown paper to the backs of my framing projects.  I am very impressed with how securely the glue really holds.  I would not suggest using these with younger kids as they tend to be really wasteful, and these aren't the cheapest types of tape.  The convenience, however, is undeniable!  I always keep a few around!",5
B005FM6XF4,"While reading other reviews and seeing a lot of negativity  I had to comment on this tape, I am a scrapbooker/card maker and this tape is wonderful it is like any other tape runner, you just need to hold it right, and instead of pulling up when releasing the tape from your project stop and remove the tape runner from the right side, by doing so the tape will not ball up with a glob a glue. The only thing I wish is that there were more on each role.",5
B005FM6XF4,would use more often than glue if it weren't so expensive.,4
B005FM6XF4,"The glue itself is great.  However, i use this with paper.  Unless you are using 110lb cover Weight paper, the glue will stick more to the paper it is dispensed off than it is to the paper you are attempting to glue.7 The price is awesome but I think they need to reconsider the paper that it is on, it seems to adhere much to strongly and inevitably tears the paper I'm trying to glue.  Used it with 110lb cover weight cardstock and it works exactly as i would want or possibly even better.  I'd say Be careful if you need this for something less than 90 weight if not it's excellent",3
B005FM6XF4,Iso I make junk journals and this tape is awesome. Butttttttt when I was first buying it it was $6.99 for the pack. I was very happy about this do to the back it was affordable n at the store it was almost 20 for freaking tape. So it's been 2 months since I have gotten some I need more so I was going to buy it. Not now I'm not.  It went up in price. That's not cool it went up like $10. Nope,3
B005FM6XF4,"Love, love, love this crafting tape and absolutely swear by it for adhesive crafts. I use these for homemade stickers, embellishments, cards, scrapbooking, etc and never have any trouble with the adhesive. I would recommend buying these in a bigger pack (10 pack) that is also sold on Amazon, but it was currently unavailable when I ordered this time. I would highly recommend for any avid crafter!",5
B005FM6XF4,"Good if you need heavy stick-on power. I used them to build my planner. It rolls out so gummy that it is bumpy to write on the page that I attached to my planner.  (The gumminess made it an uneven surface).  So they are good for certain things, but maybe not others.",4
B005FM6XF4,"I use this for my book journal. I secure a small photo of the cover of each book I have read. Started this on January 1, 2021 and have read 40 books. Not a single picture has moved, curled, or shifted! This holds each one in place and is super easy to use! Zero mess and no dry time are the icing on the cake!",5
B005FM6XF4,"It works great, but one of the cartridges broke within seconds of starting to use it. Which is irritating as it otherwise is a great product. Because of the break, I mean it popped open a spring with flying and the tap got stuck on the paper and picture I was working on, the page was damaged.Lucky me, it was the first image. Now that said, I was using it exactly as I was supposed to, and this was the second one in the package I was using. The first and third have worked fine (not on the 4th yet)... Mixed bag on overall opinion on it. Works great, but the holding device is a bit un-sturdy.",3
B005FM6XF4,"Wow, I couldn't believe the price for 48 taperunners. Even at a big discount store, the same 48 taperunners would have cost almost $94. This is a fabulous deal! I bought one and am debating buying another one. Fantastic deal. This is the only taperunner I use. The rest dry out and the pictures fall off my scrapbook pages. Not with Adtech.",5
B005FM6XF4,"Some of the reviews on these tape runners made me skeptical to buy, but they are absolutely perfect! Extremely cheap (especially considering the pack comes with 4), and they have lasted me a long time! They work great on paper (not fabric) and are quick to use. Sometimes they do get jammed, but it's nothing you can't fix. When I run out of tape in mine, I will definitely be buying more! Thanks! Would recommend to all!",5
B005FM6XF4,"I ordered 2 cases of 12  4 packs of the tape runners.  I received 2  4 packs  of the tape runners.  I should have received 96 actual tape runners and received 24 actual tape runners.  I would very much like to receive the other 76 tape runners.  I went thru the steps of contacting the merchant as directed.  I actually spoke to Mary Jane there twice in January.  She assured me that although it was an error on Amazons part, Adtech would make it right and send the rest of my order.  It is now Feb.23rd and more than sufficient time has passed to have received this and still nothing has been delivered.  I need more and have purchased this same item many times without issue.  I will gladly continue ordering this product, as I am very happy with it.  But, I would definitely like to receive what I have ALREADY PAID FOR.",1
B005FM6XF4,"This is the first glue tape I've ever used. I just got them and tried them out immediately. I just followed the guide on the back of the box, and it was super intuitive and easy to use. The caps come off really easy, so I wouldn't just throw these in a bag, but it works perfectly for my uses. These are at a great price and work beautifully.",5
B005FM6XF4,I think the adhesion is good but the application can be messy if not frustrating. It doesn't make a clean break when you lift the applicator off the surface. The adhesive can spring back and get in random places or bunch up at the end of the line you make and hang over the edge.I prefer other brands.So I would recommend using this on something that doesn't need a perfect and clean finish like in your planner or quick crafts or fixes.,3
B005FM6XF4,"Thank you! This Ad-Tech Permanent Crafter's Tape works very well and the cost is fair and reasonable. For over 20+ years now I have only been faithful to Tombow but the cost is just ridiculous especially for the small amount they in the dispenser. So I took a chance and bought this Ad-Tech. The price was so good/reasonabe/fair that I told myself even if it turned out to be not good, it would still be worth trying. And guess what? I lucked out! Great price, good value and excellent permanent tape. Thank you!",5
B002TOL40A,Pure white. Perfect tape,5
B002TOL40A,"I grabbed this to help with sealing up the gaps when installing an air conditioner in my bedroom window. It did exactly what I was hoping for and help up great throughout the whole season. The white paired much better with everything than the traditional gray duct tape.The reason I went with four stars instead of five is because there was another brand of duct tape that I used during the previous ""air conditioner season"" that was thicker and tackier. Which, felt like it made for a heartier seal. But, this did its job just fine and held up to the elements quite well. So, I would still feel pretty confident that it will do what I need from it, for most tasks. Also, being slightly thinner, it's easier to form it around corners and odd bends. Which, that could definitely be helpful in many situations.",4
B002TOL40A,LOVE DUCK!!,5
B002TOL40A,"I used this for a couple of specific things: Covering a Priority Mail shipping box that I'm using for storing items and for prepping some damaged cabinets before I put down contact paper.This is very sticky, so be careful not to get the tape stuck to itself or you will end up wasting tape. This white color is semi-sheer which I personally did not like, but it will still work for my projects.I would definitely recommend Duck Tape!",5
B002TOL40A,I always buy duck brand duct tape. Tried and true.,5
B002TOL40A,I used it for my riddler costume. Cut question marks out the tape and stuck it to my pants. It was the perfect green to match my coat. I love duck tape!,5
B002TOL40A,"I needed this for my storm door which is falling apart from the inside out.  It's a temporary fix, but does the trick. Glad to have it on hand as so much stuff around my place is white and this will come in handy.  Recommended.",5
B002TOL40A,"Like any red neck would say, this is the greatest utility youll ever have!",5
B002TOL40A,This was strong for the job intended,5
B002TOL40A,"This brown duck tape is strong and durable, making it great for general repairs, bundling, and many other tasks. It tears easily by hand, which is a plus. However, I found it didn't adhere well to my leather car seats. For those surfaces, you might need a different type of tape.",4
B002TOL40A,Would buy again,5
B002TOL40A,"Quality Product, Great Price.  A must have.",5
B002TOL40A,"This tape adheres pretty strong, not the best adhesion bit still strong. It will hold most things in place so long as the surface doesn't have many curves. Easy to tear so didn't need scissors. Would work great to seal the gaps in floor protectors or holes in tarps.",4
B002TOL40A,I used it to retape boxes before wrapping for christmas. My kids hated it but I thought it was funny. Great hold.,5
B002TOL40A,Duct tape quality as usual,5
B002TOL40A,I used this to hold some leather together but I noticed that it wouldnt stick very well and it seemed to start peeling off but for other aplications its very nice,4
B002TOL40A,This tape didn't seem as thick as the usual duck tape so I took off a star.,4
B002TOL40A,Perfect duct tape.,5
B002TOL40A,"Great for marking luggage to it does not get mised up with others on airlines, shuttlebuses or spacecraft.",5

B002TOL40A,Craft items,5
B002TOL40A,"Handy Dandy White Duct tape used around windows, doors and vents. Being white Duct Tape Brand Strength and Capabilities it can blend into a wall, window seals, used as small patchwork in the garage, basement, around many hvac or vent grilles for examples. If you live in any type of older home then you need Brand Quality white (& Silver real deal duct tape) in your tool box. This is a fact Jack said JB! DuctOn.",5
B002TOL40A,I love it. Like wow. My cat scratches at the corner of my door and so I put tape over it and wow the cat took it right off. My cat is just too strong.  Such thin drinking protein shakes and talking about macros with the alley cat. But yeah the tape is great. No issues other than my cat is just so strong.,5
B002TOL40A,This tape is effective. I have used it for years in the school setting. A little but goes a long way.,5
B002TOL40A,I used this to repair my black office chair that my grandkids had damaged by spinning on it and hitting my desk. The black was a match and covered it perfectly!,5
B002TOL40A,its not bad duct tape but also not as sticky as I would like. It's decent for the price.,4
B002TOL40A,"I live in an historic building, a former factory with various adjustments such as an opening on the bathroom ceiling covered with a wooden section which, unfortunately, did not prevent particles of fine dust to drop on all surfaces. The tape not only was easy to use but it did not draw attention to my solution of sealing the edges of the opening. I have used also on Ann antique shelf display to strengthen the fragile edges and hanging hooks and on framing paintings as well as wrapping packages to send. Always have a roll in the house for this versatile, strong, clean looking product.",5
B002TOL40A,Always great quality and works great.Removes easily and cleanly after sports and great price/ft !,5
B002TOL40A,Perfect for the job I needed (repairing a piece of siding). Great adhesive and strong.,5
B002TOL40A,Great value and works great! Good buy.,5
B002TOL40A,"Got this tape to keep in an emergency bag, and it's tape. Was on sale, so a good deal.",5
B002TOL40A,"Duck brand is always my favorite for quality and color. I use it to make storage boxes, decorate things, for crafting and repairs. Anytime I find a roll for $3.50 or less I grab it and Amazon has that.",5

B002TOL40A,As expected,5
B002TOL40A,Good and strong and great price.  Has a tendency to rip sometime when pulling off the reel.,4
B002TOL40A,I think it was in storage a long time because at first the tape seemed to be crispy.  but it was the outside layer.,4
B002TOL40A,"Many, Many uses.",5
B002TOL40A,Nothing,5
B002TOL40A,"Love the ease of use, versatility and convenience of this product. Used it to hang plastic weather barrier to my windows.",5

B002TOL40A,Great,5
B002TOL40A,"Excellent tape, try it!",4
B002TOL40A,used to hang stuff for halloween party and it worked really well with a string hold and easy to remove from objects,5
B002TOL40A,"I use this tape to label a few things.  You can write on it to label items and it sticks very well, I bend down the corners of the tape so that I have a tab to pull when I want to remove the tape.  The sides of the roll are very tacky and pick up fine lint and dust so I place the roll in a plastic bag to keep the sides clean.  I put a piece on the edge of my linen closet shelf to mark the king and queen sheets which are the same color and look alike making it a task to remember which are which when I have company.  (Never buy the same color for different sized sheets.)",5

B002TOL40A,As advertised,5
B002TOL40A,"I bought my first roll of this brand of tape to repair a John Deere mower seat and had a bunch left over . I wound up using it to label storage containers , takes a Sharpie marker quite well . Marked doesn't rub off easily and even after some time it takes rubbing alcohol to remove writing . Love this tape so much that that I needed a second roll .",5
B002TOL40A,"If you are buying this thinking it is like regular grey duct tape, don't.  It has poor adhesive value in comparison..",3
B002TOL40A,Used the  tape to hold down my classroom rug. I would not say its a heavy duty tape but is doing the job!,4
B002TOL40A,"This duct tape sticks well and can weather 3-4 years of Michigan summers and winters before needing to be replaced.  This is well worth the price, I wish I could get the 60 yard rolls in black and white but from what I can tell that size only comes in duct gray which is fine for sealing aluminum air ducts but most outdoor uses call for black or white.  This especially works excellent sealing around a window air conditioner.",5

B002TOL40A,"Listen Linda, I was on a biz trip and this tape came on time and I sure didnt feel like driving to HomeDepot (which was far from our event). It did the job and I was good.Will order again",5
B002TOL40A,Perfect for all your duct taping needs. Strong and adheres well. Great price too.,5
B002TOL40A,I do you write about tape? it works good,4
B002TOL40A,The tape is a good quality. I used it to tape our car seat. Our car is nine years old and the seat was splitting. We needed black for a black seat.,5
B002TOL40A,The white duct tape is strong  It and easy to use.  We used it to repair some cracked areas in our refrigerator.  The repair job is holding up quite well.,5
B002TOL40A,"I was trying to find a sturdy tape similar to ""duct tape"" but in white. This is certainly white, but only half the thickness and maybe a one-third the strength of the original duct tape. It met my cosmetic need to mask an area, but it's pretty lightweight tape.",3
B002TOL40A,Love using this tape.,5
B002TOL40A,"I have a black storm door with a few gaps between the glass panels and the door where air was getting through. I used this around the window panels, and the color matched the door so well that it's barely noticeable. Plus, the air is no longer getting through.",5

B002TOL40A,It works for what I get it,4

B0C8BRVRDD,"I have had a rotary cutter for a long time. It was time to replace it. Love the shape, easy to use. Locking mechanism works great. Fits well in my hand. Very sharp!",5
B0C8BRVRDD,This cutter is great-as expected. I really like how it feels in my hand.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Great cutter. Safety feature is great. Push of a button and blade is concealed.  Color was nice and the sharpness of blade was good.  Great price,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"The plastic will bend, could break and slice you hand off",4
B0C8BRVRDD,You need a new one so about this one and it works fine work is good design is good sharpness is good easy to use,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Highly recommended for sewing projects. Easy to use. Value for money.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Cutting lightweight leather with this tool does not stretch the leather out of shape the way cutting it with a knife does. It's great for cutting fringe and lacing as well. The retractable guard is a nice feature.The tool is easy to use. Just make sure to cut away from you, use a self healing cutting board and (whenever possible) a straight edge. And keep your free hand behind the blade, never in front of it.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"When I finally figured out how to hold it and apply pressure , it worked great",5
B0C8BRVRDD,Great value,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Just what I needed.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Great blade. I was using a non brand version that came with a sewing kit and I thought that it was good. It was crap compared to this. This cutter is smooth like butter.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Sharp, good lock and trigger mechanism, very clean cuts. I've cut cardstock, book binding board and paper with it. It does a great job at all of it.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,Love this. Blade is very sharp. Perfect size for one handed use. I love the safety cover. I've used this type of cuter before but I like how this ones blade cover works the best.Definitely recommend.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,I like the cutter itself better than I like others that I have.  It fits my hand better.  The claims on how fantastic the blade is - that's a whole different thing.  It only comes with one and I am so far under-impressed.  I ordered two more thinking that maybe I got a bad blade - they are expensive and you need to factor that in to the overall cost for use.  Will see what I think after using one of those of one of the other brands I have on hand.  Fiskars tends to not disappoint and I have a collection of their scissors/shears in various sizes.  This is a miss for me though.,3
B0C8BRVRDD,Comfortable in my hand. Very sharp. Have cut through four layers of fabric. Still using original blade after quite a few quilting projects,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I really liked how this fit in my hand, but the blade it came with dulled very quickly as did the replacement blade I purchased locally. It made for an expensive small quilt.",3
B0C8BRVRDD,Rotary cutter has sharp blade. Easy to lock and unlock.  I don't sew everyday so I still learning best way to use on heavier fabric. I found exacto blade knife cutter easier than these on Sunbrella brand marine canvas.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Best way to cut fabric or other thin materials. Just get a straight edge and cutting board and go to town!! Beats the hell out of using scissors,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I've had this same style and brand in a smaller 45 mm. cutter for YEARS, it's my favorite one to use. I bought the large one because I am so pleased with the earlier purchase. Features are exactly what I wanted again. VERY PLEASED!",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I have not used this yet,a friend recommend this for cutting straight, so I can't you a review at this time.",4
B0C8BRVRDD,this is so comfortable.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,This rotary tool is handy and easy to use.  The 60mm size cuts through many layers of fabric with ease.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"The slide-away blade guard is different and took a bit of getting used to, but now that I am, I like it. Its easier for someone with hand strength issues to use than the squeeze ones. Still cuts as nicely as the old style.  Overall, a nice addition to my tool box.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,This product is great for how much money I spent on it. It cuts very easily and and has the cover that protects it very conveniently. It seems a little light but I haven't found that affected the quality.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Great purchase Precise cutting tool. Easy to use and essential in your toolbox/craft room.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I have a bad habit of forgetting to close my rotary cutter when I'm finished cutting the fabric. This solved the problem. And, as usual, great Fiskars quality.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I have been using this rotary cutter since I purchased it in September.  This cutter is fantastic!  It's already sliced through well over 750 garments.  Each garment is cut into a minimum of 4 pieces.  The garments are cut into between 4 and 6 pieces PLUS what is cut through and discarded such as elastic cuffs & waist bands, zippers and the button plackets.  That's a lot of cutting.  Here it is, December 8th, 3 months and over 750 garments and easily over 3000 slices later ....... and I am STILL using the very same original blade that the rotary cutter arrived with!Those folks who claim they have to run the rotary cutter back & forth 10 times or multiple times, to actually cut through whatever their cutting, all I can say is, barring an actual flaw in workmanship or assembly of a particular Fiskars Rotary Cutter or its blade [these mishaps, ie., ""duds"" do occur in industry], that the issue lies with the user and their technique and not the rotary cutter itself.  Try holding the handle at an angle, blade down at waist level, handle at navel level.  Don't run it parallel to the item being cut.Believe me, barring a ""dud"" it's not a dull blade.I would definitely recommend this product.  In fact, I'm re-ordering .......I want a second Fiskars Rotary Cutter.  I have a cutting partner who assists me.  She, too, is impressed with this rotary cutter.  We each want our own.  Now we'll have 2 rotary cutters.  This makes the job go swiftly and effortlessly.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,I got these to replace an old rotary cutter that broke and couldn't be happier. This cutter is sharp and cuts where you line it up to. It seems very well constructed and durable. I have no doubt that this will last me for years and ears. The only thing that I'll have to do is to replace the rotary blade which is readily available to purchase when needed. Very happy with this purchase.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,I bought this rotary cutter with the intent of paying a bit more up front for a name brand and large blade so that it would last and be the only one I purchased. Very happy with it.Fast forward and I discovered perforated blades (great for adding a crocheted edge to a no sew fleece material). I have searched everywhere under the sun and can only find perforated blades in 45 mm size not 60 mm. So I ended up buying a whole other cutter to fit the smaller size blades. So limited versatility due solely to the limited availability of the perforated blades.,4
B0C8BRVRDD,Works wonderfully. Should have ordered this years ago to replace my old dull cutter.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Great for cutting material from fabric to paper to vinyl, runs along a ruler well, but I lost the tension bolt the moment I opened it of course lol",5
B0C8BRVRDD,The rotary cutter wasnt even inside its packaging. I can only assume it must be used or something. I dont know. But I hope not.,4
B0C8BRVRDD,"Fits nice in your hand, cuts smoothly!",4
B0C8BRVRDD,"Live this item, easy to use and cuts thru jeans like butter!",5
B0C8BRVRDD,i am finally able to wear so many bottoms because of this tool,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Blade cuts perfectly with very little pressure. Time will tell how long the blade will stay this sharp. The plastic button to extend blade seems cheap and fragile. But it fits well in my hand.,4
B0C8BRVRDD,Precise cutting tool. Easy to use and essential in your toolbox/craft room.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Works so good! Nice size feels safe! Glides thru the cloth like butter!,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Love this cutter.  What a difference!,5
B0C8BRVRDD,She loved them.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I like the shape of this item. It fits very well into my hand, not heavy or bulky. I use it for sewing and quilts.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"A great investment for sewing projects, saves a lot of time. Lightweight, easy to handle, charges quickly but I get a lot of work done on a fully charged pair of  scissors.  Would definitely recommend this product",5
B0C8BRVRDD,As a male that learned home economics in middle school in the 80s we did not have these only scissors. While having a talk with some ladies about my products and how I made them they told me about this tool. It was a life changer with less waste materials. Production is up and this tool works perfectly.  Sharp and cuts through felt and silicone like butter even doubled up.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,This works great for cutting fabric. So far I have cut up to 4 layers or quilting (cotton) fabric and it did a great job! Also this is the best price I have found for one of these. Everywhere else I have see wants double or more the price.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Make sure to get plenty of replacement blades when you purchase this. I love the ease of using this. However, it's only good for a few cuts and then the blade needs replacing.",4
B0C8BRVRDD,"I cut a fair amount of marine upholstery and cover fabrics using a hot knife where possible and a rotary cutter when not.  Been using an Olfa 60mm with steel blades, decided to try the Fiskars Ergo version with titanium blades.  I don't see any cutting difference with the titanium vs. steel yet - would be nice if the titanium ones lasted longer than the steel but time will tell.The Fiskars cutter is lighter and more comfortable than the Olfa, but I'm not sure how well it will hold up.  The other main difference is blade exposure.  The Fiskars blade stays ""out"" until you push the orange button to retract it, the Olfa blade is only exposed as long as you are squeezing the handle and retracts when you let go.  Easy once you get used to it, but important given the sharpness of these blades.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"What a great idea, and product.  This cuts smoothly and crisply.  I was blown away with how simple it made cutting.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,I have been using Fiskars products for years and found the Easy Change DuoLoop Rotary Cutter to be very user-friendly. I appreciate its convenient blade-changing mechanism and its capacity to fit both 45 and 60-mm blades.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"As others have pointed out, the quality of steel put into the stock blade for this tool is poor.  Perhaps Fiskar's market research suggests that the benefits of providing a quality blade doesn't exceed the cost, but I would think a better blade would be a confidence booster for buying more of their products.That said, the handle and retraction mechanism is great and it would be difficult to improve on.  The only question is which size works best, and this is likely solely related to the size of the hand using it.  I've got large hands so this one 60mm works well for me.  My wife has much smaller hands and finds this one to be too much work and too tiring, and she uses the smaller version.",4
B0C8BRVRDD,"Anyone who does a lot of sewing, will tell you that these rotary cutters are very nice to have around. They make life a lot easier! This is a wonderful rotary cutter at a great price.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I got this rotary cutter in hopes of making it easier for me to cut my sewing fabric easier, since it was quite hard for me to get straight, consistent cuts in fabric that wouldn't fray quickly, and it succeeded! Just to test the waters and see how well this rotary cutter would cut, I used a thinner cotton fabric and it cut though with ease. I then moved onto a very heavy weight canvas thinking it wouldn't be able to pierce it all the way, but I was wrong. The result might have even turned out better than the cotton! This stellar performance is probably due to the bigger size of the blade (60mm) and the material that it was made of (titanium) and I couldn't be happier! If this rotary cutter ever fails (which I doubt it will any time soon) I will purchase the same exact one.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"So, I have this same rotary cutter but with the regular blades, which I have used on low-stakes projects including baby quilts, etc.  I wasn't going to trust it for a prom dress alteration though, so I purchased this one with the platinum coated blades.  Thank Goodness.  With my self-healing cutting mat, chalk markings and my quilting acrylic ""ruler"" it went well and was over so fast that the project I've been putting off for 3 months is done and lovely.  Wish these titanium option had been avl back when I bought the old one as it wouldn't cut well through pre-washed and ironed calico fabrics about 16 years ago when I bought it (new)Highly recommend.UPDATE:  Well, it didn't last long.  Now the blade rotates rather than staying stationary as I cut, and the screw cap can't be tightened enough to prevent it.  The blade isn't cutting as well.  I hauled out my old Fiskars rotary cutter from 17 years ago, which never had a replaced blade, and am cutting through quilt fabric strips just fine.  Ugh.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,very durable easy to use,5
B0C8BRVRDD,This item arrived as pictured.  It's obviously been opened then re-packaged.  You can see where the plastic cover was taped back on to the cardboard backing.  I'll provide a follow on review after I re-re-open the item.Follow up:  I used this rotary cutter and it functions perfectly.  No issues with the product itself although I'd rather have received a brand new item.  The posting on Amazon did not indicate a used or previously opened item.,3
B0C8BRVRDD,"Quilter friend said to change the blade every time you work on a quilt. You can order packof 15 blades, and it cuts the fabric perfectly. Clean and Sharp. Game changer!",5
B0C8BRVRDD,I only wish it included some spare blades.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,My previous rotary cutter stopped working and I needed a new one to continue multiple projects I was in the middle of at the time the previous cutter broke. I like Fiskars brand because it has always been reliable for scissors. I ordered it and it came a quick few days later so I could continue my projects. This one is better than my previous one! The handle has some cushion and the blade is smooth and secure. I've been able to cut through multiple layers of fabric at one time with ease. It doesn't slip as I'm cutting. It's easy to use and I love it!,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"SO this doesnt cut. at all, no matter how much pressure i apply, clean the blade, sharpen the blade. wont cut. barely makes a slit in any fabric i try to cut it on. Stinks. I got some no name brand that works better than this. I expected more from this brand name. Worse part is... its amazon and u think it would be returnable, but its NOT. so beware.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,I use this cutter with the Edge track ruler and the cuts never go off to the side.  The small inner orange wheel engages in the track and holds the cutter in place.  So as long as you hold your ruler securely you get nice straight cuts.  The cutter is easy to hold and I would recommend this to all.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"This has got to be one of the best sewing tools I've ever purchased for many reasons. I'm left-handed. I find many tools difficult to use but not this one. It just fits right. The contour of the handle makes it feel like an extension of my arm/hand rather than a tool I struggle to hold at the optimum angle to make it work right. I've been using a straight handled rotary cutter with regular stainless blades for several years. I do ""ok"" on straight cuts. But being left-handed, circles or curves are really difficult. The 45 mm titanium blade is amazing! Used it to cut the round top of a fleece hat. It cut extra thick fleece like a hot knife through soft butter! Going around the curves was a piece of cake with that 45 mm blade. When cutting fleece or lots of cotton for a quilt top, it seemed like I had to change the blade frequently so as not to wind up with ragged edges. I have a feeling all of my 8 different scissors are going to be feeling a little left out as I become more proficient with this wonder-tool!",5
B0C8BRVRDD,This is the first stick style cutter I have purchased. The handle is comfortable and blade is very sharp. Happy with my purchase.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Been pleased with many other Fiskar products, and this does not disappoint! I can hold a pattern in place and not have to raise fabric up with sissors, and cuts into boxes like a charm! Will probably get another just for sewing.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,Great Product! Excellent seller and very prompt delivery,5
B0C8BRVRDD,This is great because it fits my hand with easy grip feature. It is durable and glides along the cutter. I really like the open and close feature on the cutter. I am going to purchase another one.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,Cuts through four layers of fabric quite easilyComfortable to use,5
B0C8BRVRDD,This thing had cut through all the minky and cuddle fabric I could throw at it! It also nearly took one of my fingers too!,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"I LOVE this rotary cutter! I have my own Etsy/Amazon Handmade shop and I cut A LOT of fabric. Fiskars has always been my go to brand in cutting tools, and this cutter did not disappoint. The handle is comfortable and easy to grip, the blade trigger is easy to use, and the blade glides like a dream. What I prefer most about the design of this cutter is the handle, the additional piece that goes in front of the fingers allows for better control and comfort. My only complaint is a problem that seems to be common with these cutter, the blade becoming loose with use. As I have experience with all my Fiskars Rotary cutters the blade it comes with is fine, but when you change the blade as you use it the knob does not stay secure so I have to make sure to keep re-tightening it as I go. It is a bit annoying, but not enough that I would not recommend this cutter.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,Highly recommended. Long lasting and sharp.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"This is my favourite of my two 60mm rotary cutters. I debated on splurging on a more expensive brand or going with the Fiskars, chose the Fiskars, and I've been completely happy with them since. The handle is very comfortable and easy to grip while maneuvering around fabric and the blade retracting switch doesn't get in my way or accidentally pushed during use, which was a problem with the way my previous 60mm cutter was designed (that is, it was NOT designed for left-handed/ambidextrous use - the button was right where my hand pushed the most).The button that instantly pushes the blade out doesn't get pushed accidentally in the drawer that I keep it in, either, so I never got around to making a cover for it - it retracts well enough for safety in my adults-only craft room, so I'm happy with it.The Fiskars brand rotary blades are more expensive than your generic hardware store rotary blades, but they last quite a while and I don't feel like I'm really wasting any money on them. I get quite a bit of use out of them.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"The product is great but it took 5 extra dayq to be delivered, it caused a hassle since i was out of town.",3
B0C8BRVRDD,Good quality. Works the way I would expect. Far better than a cheaper orange one I got a year or two ago.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,This thing is amazing. It was SO easy to cut deco mesh for my wreath. It cut like butter. I couldnt imagine how long this wouldve taken with scissors. I never want to use scissors again!,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Works like a charm, feels great in my hand, and the cutter cover is so cool. Would 100% recommend to a friend.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Gave it a 4 because it came with a very dull blade, seriously Fiskars I thought better of you. Bought some blades thankfully the worked great and was able to use it.  Works good but so disappointing.",4
B0C8BRVRDD,Fiskars are the best rotary cutters!  I've tried other brands and they just don't compare.,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Cuts very smoothly.  It's easy to trade the blades,  i like the larger size wheel.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Only problem is that when i lay the rotary cutter down on my cutting surface, the close button is often activated immediately.. maybe I'm dropping it more than laying it down.  I realize it may be a safety feature, but if so it's not consistent.  Annoying to try to cut, and realize the blade protector is activated.",4
B0C8BRVRDD,"I have arthritis, and this rotary cutter handle is way more comfortable and easier to hold onto. Definite 5 star.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,These cutters are absolutely wonderful.  I keep raving about them to everyone.  One hundred times better than scissors or electric scissors to cut fabric.  The healing cutting board along with them is the best!!,5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Cuts good, but not any better than other rotary cutters.",5
B0C8BRVRDD,"Bought this tool to use in making a t-shirt quilt.  I am left handed and researched different brands of rotary cutters. The first blade had a little ""niche"" in it that refused to cut a tiny place in the strip as I was cutting - changed the blade and had the same problem but in a different place in the cutting line.  Not much of a time saver if I have to go back into the project with regular scissors to snip the ""catch"".  However, it is great that the blade can be switched for us Lefties and it a big time saver.  Will probably try yet another blade at $6+.  It does feel comfortable to my hand and I can't imagine tackling this project with regular scissors.  Amazon Prime is amazing - received quickly as usual.  Would definitely buy again simply because of the convenience and quickness of cutting.",4
B0C8BRVRDD,"I bought this as a gift. I know very little about crafting. That being said, when I saw it, I could tell that the safety could break easily. Was very disappointed as it was too late to send back. The person I bought it for said the blades cut very smoothly. However, the safety is hard to use and likely will not hold up. Offered to send it back and get something different, but she said she likes the blade enough to keep. If I had it to do over, I would not buy again.",3
B0C8BRVRDD,Works great for cutting ribbon for my wreath making,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Love the colors. Maybe slightly less sticky than regular washi tape but sticky enough for my needs! Used it to decorate my toddlers room. He looooves the colors. Very bright, good amount of tape for the cost. Doesn't rip paper or walls when removed.",5
B07G5TRF4R,I wrapped my walking cane in two colors of this tape.I can change the colors at anytime .It is for decoration and for caution.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"When we had to sell a family home and the contents were going to be distributed to 4 different locations, we used the colored tape to indicate where the movers would be taking each item. This allowed them to clearly see where each item was going so they could load the moving van in order. They were impressed and so happy when we gave them the color key, and doing it this way saved us money because the process was streamlined saving time. At the destinations, the tape was easily removed leaving no residue. The price for the tape was very reasonable, and it was delivered quickly.",5
B07G5TRF4R,"Expensive for the amount you get, but it helps us keep better organized. I notice the colored tape doesn't stick as well as some standard masking tape, but still and OK product.",4
B07G5TRF4R,Colors were bright. Worked for my project,5
B07G5TRF4R,"This was very effective for making a move work well and have the boxes lined up in the right rooms and in the right places. I put a 2-inch piece around the upper corner of the box so it showed on both sides so the movers would see it, and a 1 in piece on the top of the box. It's stuck just fine on cardboard. It was important to smooth it down with my fingers because it's not super sticky. It's like painter's tape. It's not something that I would use for a long-term application but it was great for the move. It didn't make a mark on any of the lamps or other things I put it on. It feels off readily without leaving a mark. I didn't try it on furniture because I don't think it would have stuck and it was evident which rooms those things would go in. I put a long piece of tape on a piece of cardboard and wrote on it with marker what room that corresponded to and hung it at the door for the movers. That was semi effective since they brought in stacks of boxes with different tapes on them. It made a difference for me to stand in the front room and be the traffic cop and say this goes here, that goes in that room, that goes in the back bedroom. The darker tapes it was hard to read what the room was on my little placard with all the different colored tapes designating rooms. So I also taped the right color at the doorways of the place I wanted things to go. In the rooms I put the tape where I wanted them to pile the boxes. All in all it worked well. I had one color short of enough to designate all the rooms so I cut up some white paper and made that the color for the bathrooms.",5
B07G5TRF4R,I bought these tapes for my thrift store products I like to tape the bowls and plates together. It's stickiness is not effective. This is very low quality tape. I would definitely not recommend painting with it. I will not be buying it again. The only thing it has going for it is the pretty colors.,3
B07G5TRF4R,I love masking tape and how versatile it can be.. the fact that these are various colors? Sign me up. The quality of this tape is ideal. Has good adhesion but does not leave a sticky residue when removed (including from carpets- hello imaginary roads). I highly recommend for a crafter or a mom of a toddler who is constantly trying to spin magic out of thin air.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Its like painter tape so legal on walls and whiteboards. Great bright colors and enough length in each roll for small to moderate projects. Price was a bit higher than I'd like, but that's always how I feel when I'm paying to set up my classroom",4
B07G5TRF4R,"Works for crafts, projects and homeschool lessons. Quality seems pretty decent as well",4
B07G5TRF4R,Product is as description.  The only problem is that it's VERY difficult - impossible actually - to find the starting point on the roll.,4
B07G5TRF4R,My 3 grandkids love this stuff! They have so much fun using it for all kinds of play. It's basically colored painter's tape so there's no damage to furniture or leftover sticky stuff.,5
B07G5TRF4R,A gift for a very creative young person,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Size of rolls as described, but smaller than I envisioned",5
B07G5TRF4R,"Good colors, nicely packed and delivered fast.",5
B07G5TRF4R,Great idea to sell this package.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Definitely not the same quality as the name brands.  Ok for one time use, but not great if you need to adjust the tape.",3
B07G5TRF4R,Endless fun for my toddlers. They love using this tape for different play and activities. It comes off easily from pretty much any surface.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"I use them to label my toddler's books, toys, food jars, work great!",5
B07G5TRF4R,Love it.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Used this to color code for a move for a friend, perfect for the job!",5
B07G5TRF4R,I make greeting cards am am always trying new techniques,5
B07G5TRF4R,Great quality.  I use them all the time in the classroom to color code things,5
B07G5TRF4R,Moving!  Great product,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Good for the price, no issues. Used it to help organize while moving",5
B07G5TRF4R,The teachers like using the tape on the carpet to make designs for the kids to follow.,5
B07G5TRF4R,Did my prep the day before so I could come in and spray the very next morning and this tape did not stay stuck to masking paper or to the same tape so I had to press every edge again,2
B07G5TRF4R,Bought 2 sets to help color coordinate with a move. They work great.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"The tape has a nice weight to it, and the colors are bright and vivid. So far I haven't had any adhesion issues (too little or too much) -- I'm using the tape to label jars. I can write on the tape with a silver Sharpie and it shows up just fine.The reason for the 4 stars is that, while perfectly adequate and functional, the color isn't as bright as I expected. The pigmentation is just fine; I think the difference is that the tape looks vibrant on the roll but is actually quite transparent when you unroll it, which dilutes the color a bit.In every other way, this tape is a delight to use, and I'll be back to order more when I'm through with this (... But that's going to take a long time!)",4
B07G5TRF4R,"I used for marking remote controls and corresponding TVs, etc.  The glue on the tape isn't very strong and the tape lifted up on the TVs even after cleaning with alcohol before application.  Also the colors aren't very vibrant when applied in a single layer.  But you can't beat the price and it works good enough.",3
B07G5TRF4R,"I'll tell ya, you can't find masking tape like this in a big box store. I tried. Many many times.It's the grip of this tape that makes it stand out.The project I was working on was a large dollhouse. I needed masking tape for clean paint lines, as well as holding pieces together while gluing. This handled both very well, but again holding pieces together is the selling point vs. any other brand of masking tape I tried.Now, I used almost every bit of these 6 rolls to the point where I ran out. I didn't want to take the time to order more tape so I bought a name brand at Walmart to finish up.It was a bit of a disaster. I managed..Still this will be my go-to for future projects.I know, I know... It's just tape, right? But I doubt, with as frustrated as I got with store bought tape I may not have finished the dollhouse without it...",5
B07G5TRF4R,"This is basically painter's tape. We bought this tape for moving, we wanted to color code the boxes. This tape was not good for that, as it has a ""sticky note"" type adhesive, and it peeled off a lot. However, it has been PERFECT for planning new furniture purchases - we block out areas on the floor, and move as needed. Nice colors!",4
B07G5TRF4R,"Great value, great colors.",5
B07G5TRF4R,Great Tape!,5
B07G5TRF4R,Tape is reliable on the walls or any surfaces really! My toddler enjoys using it for play for cars and trucks as well!,5
B07G5TRF4R,Like all diff colors,5
B07G5TRF4R,I bought these to color code my Chromebooks and chargers.  The colors are vibrant but not great at being tape.,2
B07G5TRF4R,This multi-pack of colored masking tape arrived quickly and with the colors shown in the picture.  It was perfect for many different uses for different color groups at a summer camp we were running.  We used it to mark off big sections on a (wooden) gym floor to indicate which group should sit where based on color group. It came off easily and cleanly.  It was also used on poster boards and walls and to hold up decorations like balloons and crepe paper. This was the best pics I could find as well.  Happy with this!,5
B07G5TRF4R,"I bought this for my grandson to play with who is 5. It was really hard to get the tape started coming off. Sometimes it stripped and I had to pick at it to get the tape coming off again. It was a lot of fun for my grandson,  but the rolls of tape were not as thick as the picture seemed to be.  I would still buy it again.",4
B07G5TRF4R,"This tape is great for kids/toddlers. There are so many different ways to use this tape to create motor skill developing play. Now that he's a little older, we make sure to name these colors as well. This is one of the only items I can find (even on the vast world of Amazon) that has distinct colors of the rainbow. Most other items have dark blue and light blue, etc. This simply has ""blue."" I've come back to repurchase this item time and time again. It is so great and also easy to grab for on the go play!",5
B07G5TRF4R,This is a very useful item that is also fun.,5
B07G5TRF4R,"The sticky-ness of the tape rolls are not necessarily their strongest point, but it is easy to rip and all of the colors are fabulous. I have labeled a few boxes and it works fine for that (sometimes you have to straighten the edges back out because the tape doesn't stick really great) but when I am using the tape to hold down my drafting paper on a drafting board, it works great. :)",4
B07G5TRF4R,"Bought a couple of packs of these for moving houses.  The plan was to use a small piece on each box / piece of furniture to designate which room it goes to (with the designated room receiving a matching piece of tape on the door / jam to direct the movers to).Tape seemed to go on well at first, but it started peeling.  Adhesion varied by the surface, but cardboard boxes seemed to be the worst (which of course made up 90% of what I wanted to tape).  After half a day the edges started lifting, and after about 24 hours, some of the vertical only pieces of tape started to fall off.  We started making a 90 degree bend out of the tape- a couple inches on a side then folding over to a couple inches on top so the box above could help hold it in place.It didnt end up terrible, but we lost about 10% of them completely in the move (only a few days after boxing).As a result, I wouldnt suggest buying these for this purpose - find a tape with better adhesion.  These would be great for little kids arts and crafts stuff where easy removal is important.",2
B07G5TRF4R,"I used this tape to mark cardboard boxes for a move. The tape did not stick well to the cardboard and I was constantly pressing it back down. The colors are vibrant and the tape is easy to tear off the roll. Perhaps the tape works better on different surfaces, but if you are using this to mark cardboard boxes, be advised.",4
B07G5TRF4R,"Pros:-An anywhere, non-damaging activity that's mess-free-Great for travel and rental places-Vibrant colors and plenty of each to make little shapes or lines on the floorCons:-If you don't keep track of these, they will end up on clothes, in your dryer, and all over the house. Fortunately they have not caused damage to any surface - including the clothing - and they come out in most washes in the dryer.-Not really designed to hold up items for long term. The main attraction is the low impact of their use.",5
B07G5TRF4R,"Okay so like, don't use to tape down drawings to pull up later cause it will tear even strong art boards, but also don't use it to tape boxes cause it'll just pop up.  So like good if you have something in between thatMy intention was to use it to border my drawings and accidentally ruined one with it oops",5
B07G5TRF4R,I bought this to temporarily color code some household items. The tape could be stickier. I wouldn't depend on it to permanently adhere to most surfaces.,4
B07G5TRF4R,Came off after the 5th day.,2
B07G5TRF4R,Not happy with quality,1
B07G5TRF4R,"We used these colorful tapes to color-code boxes when moving to a new home and it was the perfect solution. The tape stuck well to our boxes, was easy to write on with marker for labeling and also removed easily, similar to painters tape. No complaints, would buy again.",5
B07G5TRF4R,"Does not last, a day after using it on carboard surface, it peeps off. I pressed it a second time, lasted 2 days .Useless",1
B07G5TRF4R,"I used this tape to color coordinated my moving boxes so the movers would be able to know which room to place each box with great ease. However, the adhesive didn't work properly on cardboard boxes so I had to tape over the colored tape with clear tape. So spent extra but it was too late to try another brand. I would imagine it would work just fine on paper for creating projects etc.",3
B07G5TRF4R,"I love this product for crafting. Unfortunately, it is a tad too wide. An inch is wider than I thought.",5
B07G5TRF4R,This tape is great if you keep in mind the adhesive will not stick for very long.  I used it for a large art piece I was painting and it got the job done. My lines were smooth and the tape stayed on as the paint dried. About 8 hours after placing the tape the adhesive started to fail. I wouldn't recommend this tape if you're painting walls of a house. Use it for small projects only.,3
B07G5TRF4R,The package was opened. I was not pleased,1
B07G5TRF4R,Estan bien por su precio,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Two colors of the tape I have used, green and blue, both are short of 12 meters long, more or less. The green tape is even shorter. A little disappointed.",3
B07G5TRF4R,"These are great. I used them for my classroom on the ground to spread desks apart for physical distancing, and they stick great. Almost two months in and they are still sticking",4
B07G5TRF4R,Would have rated this 5 stars it it stuck better. This is perfect if you are using it for temporary things. It does not lift off paint or leave any resident when removing it from surfaces. Colors are nice.,4
B07G5TRF4R,"They have a paper-like texture to them.I've used these throughout the year to mark plants in my garden - easier than writing out names, I don't have that big of a variety. I'm sure there'll be other uses down the road - plenty of tape, will last me a long time.",5
B07G5TRF4R,"Colors came as depicted, but it has poor adhesion. Don't use other for labeling as it comes off super easily.",3
B07G5TRF4R,"The tapes are the colors I expected. However, the width of the tape is not 1 inch as the listing says.",3
B07G5TRF4R,"Pros- tapes separate easily from each other & stick to each other with minor pressure- easy to place on wood, glass, and pencils/notebooks- comes off easily after being placed & has continually adhesionCons- nothing bad so far",5
B07G5TRF4R,"I expected full sized masking tape and received mini tape rolls that are smaller than the palm of your hand, maybe 2 inches in diameter.",4
B07G5TRF4R,Tape is very small rolls,1
B07G5TRF4R,Used for a sensory path. Sticks pretty well and holds up on tile even with daily rubbing on it. Fun color choices too,4
B07G5TRF4R,Use in my classroom to color code items for groups .  Colors are vibrant and tape sticks but can easy be removed or repositioned .I will be buying more !!!,5
B07G5TRF4R,I was expecting this tape to adhere better - poor quality. I end up used a glue stick on the ends to help them hold.,3
B07G5TRF4R,Exactly what I was looking for,5
B07G5TRF4R,My 6 year old grandson loves to make pictures using colored tape. This was the perfect gift for him! Inspired his creativity!,5
B07G5TRF4R,"Variety of colors and great value.  They are thick and of good quality, and are very sticky.",4
B07G5TRF4R,"Use this for floor markings.  It is as thick as the painters tape, but offers the color variety.  It has lasted my wiggly students scuffing for months now and just replaced with a new fall color.",5
B07G5TRF4R,I liked the color choice of this product. I am a caregiver for a dementia person and I gave them the option of what she saw the best and used it to mark stairs so she knew when they came up.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"If you're in need of a paper cutter around the house or for travel and are not looking for a heavy, more expensive model, this little product does the trick.  This plastic paper cutter is well constructed and does the trick for cutting standard copy paper.  While I haven't tried it, but I think it would easily cut card stock as well with some firm pressure on the blade.  Replacement blades are also available here on Amazon.I wanted a paper cutter that was compact, didn't cost a lot, and would easily let me cut copy paper for art projects.  If the same is true for you, then this is the product you want to purchase.  It is great for cutting one piece of paper at a time.  I'm glad I made the purchase.  It worked great for me!!",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"- I've been struggling with an old bypass cutter that's huge and heavy, and never did make straight cuts.  I wanted to cut some paper for making modular origami and lost patience.  So I looked around on Amazon and chose this paper cutter.  I liked the overall-black color because it contrasts with any paper, etc., color I might decide to use, without visually ""clashing"" with any, and the white lines are easy for me to see.  It also had received decent reviews.- The small cutter-head unit is orange, but it's not large enough to be visually distracting, yet plainly visible.- I also liked the transparent paper holder because of the visibility - I don't have to strain to see through a color, and cam instantly see the alignment of my sheet(s).  Plus, again, ""transparent"" doesn't clash, ergo, it reduces eyestrain.- It's plastic, but it seems to be the kind that will last a very long time, which works well for me, since I tend to keep things for as long as they still work.  To that end, I also went ahead and bought a package of six replacement cutting heads (B095WSLXPK  to be exact).- Since it *is* plastic, it is VERY light-weight, and it's also small enough that I can use it on my lap-desk.- Those two factors are definite ""plusses"" for me.It seems to be sturdy enough and, although I've only done a few cuts with it so far, it seems to have good accuracy.  The extending arm tucks into the bottom and is fastened with a screw which does keep it from flopping around.  I haven't actually tried using it yet, but right off the proverbial bat, I like that it's optional, and integrates into the bottom of the main unit when it's not in use.  Meaning, it's also easy to *store*.  I can put it back into its package and slip the whole thing into a small drawer.- The description says it will cut ""up to 12 sheets of paper"", but I wouldn't bother trying to cut that many because it's too easy for paper to slip, which then causes inaccurate cuts.  It also wears the cutting blade out faster.  I'm happy with accurately cutting one, or a very few, sheets.-- There seem to be several nearly-identical variants of this item being sold, and I might have been able to save a dollar had I put in the time to search longer and try something with fewer reviews, but I'm perfectly happy with this one.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"It's small and easy to store, which I like a lot since I live in a small space. It cuts cleanly and accurately, feels well-made, and works well. It's a good value for the money.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,This thing is awesome. It takes up so little room and it cuts so well. Wish I found out about this sooner as I would have bought it a long time ago!,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Nice piece that isnt so small its hard to use but also not bulky.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Sharp and works well easy to use it's not heavy,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"As expected for the price. Good for light crafting paper cutting, also cuts card stock. Lightweight but good price for my needs.",4
B07MP9JQ4W,Great product. Very easy to use and cuts multiple pages at a time. Very easy to see where to make the cut. I love this product.,4
B07MP9JQ4W,"Sweet!  Small, Simple, sharp, smooth. I was so sick of my not straight lines with scissors.  This thing is so small it's easy to store.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Exactly what I wanted,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Very useful,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Very effective for small cutting and trimming jobs.. price was right.,4
B07MP9JQ4W,"IT did its job very well ,and its my go to tool.Raymond",5
B07MP9JQ4W,As described,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"sharp,clean cuts",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Works great for small projects, not for heavy duty!",4
B07MP9JQ4W,works great,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"For the price, it can't be beat.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,It cuts.,4
B07MP9JQ4W,Works very good cuts all kinds of thickness I love it,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Used it to cut photos to size. Cut well with no issues.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Works great for crafts.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,It works great and with multiple papers at once!  It would be ideal if it was made larger but it cuts well.,4
B07MP9JQ4W,Works well,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"I bought this to use for work, and I use it often.  It's just the right size to easily store and cuts through my papers easily and cleanly.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Works well,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Me ha resuelto maravillosamente, parece endeble, pero corta como mi ex las conversaciones. Una maravilla",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Needed this for my wedding planning. Was able to use it on my vellum paper just fine. I wish it was a little more sturdy. For the price point though it's pretty good,4
B07MP9JQ4W,"I think this wont work a long time, but it will for what I need it for. I only use it for one sheet of paper at a time. I cant see it working on several sheets at a time.",4
B07MP9JQ4W,Lightweight and easy to use.  CutsThrough several sheets of paper,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"It is a good tool, quite beyond to the price",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Awesome,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"I rarely review Amazon products, but this cutter is amazing! I'm a musician and I regularly make posters and flyers for my shows. This is perfect for what I need.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Exactly what I needed for my kids science fair project.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"This has worked great for my needs.  I like that the ruler folds down, allowing me to store the cutter in my drawer.  Great product!",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Used it for cutting paychecks before mailing them.,4
B07MP9JQ4W,These are smaller than the original blade that came on the cutter. Little disappointed they aren't like the original. Probably will be returning.,3
B07MP9JQ4W,Great product! My daughter loves to use it for her crafting ~,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Got mine and it works wonderfully. I use it to cut card stock layered with sticky photo paper and it cuts through the layers with ease and accuracy. I am most impressed with its quality and size. I was worried I would need a large cutter but this does the work with little effort, superb quality, and stores very easily with its compact size.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Works perfectly!,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Had this a few months now and it works great. I have to use it at work and it cuts back on a lot of time.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,A must have for cutting straight lines. Helps save wasted material in projects,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"The only thing that really I didn't like was the fact that the gap is a bit wide, and depending on how you handle it you could end up with 1mm more or less. Just a matter of attention really that's why I've kept a 5 star review.Other than that it gripple the paper very well, cuts amazingly, is sturdy and portable. Very good buy",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"I bought the cheapest paper cutter I could find, so I was pleasantly surprised that this seems to be a very high quality cutter. I have no complaints.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,,5
B07MP9JQ4W,I liked everything about it,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"This works perfect for my miniature projects.  Very sharp, easy to use.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"I was pleasantly surprised by this.  I bought it when I lost my full-sized paper cutter at Christmas time.  I just bought it to tide me over until the full-sized one showed back up.  It is so lightweight and I like that it folds down so small.  Though not as sturdy, it is suitable for 90% of jobs and is much easier to travel with.  Now that I've found my full-size paper cutter, I still use this paper cutter for a lot of my paper cutting needs.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"It's great for trimming photos and cutting straight lines on paper when needed.  The blade is recessed.  Therefore, it's much safer than a traditional guillotine style cutter - particularly for kids.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,I use this cutter to make cardstock price tags for items that I sell.  It works very well for that purpose and is easy to use.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Very light weight. Works well, excellent for home use. Compact in size for storage.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,I could fit a decent amount of sheets in here and worked great,5
B07MP9JQ4W,works great,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"It makes cutting Cardstock, construction paper, and tissue paper a breeze! made crafting with my toddlers so much easier.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Did exactly what I needed it to do for a great price!,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Good value for money, this was one of the cheapest products available, easy to use and I love it so far",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Works great for cutting photos,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Perfect for journaling,4
B07MP9JQ4W,"Nice convenient paper cutter. When I lost my first one, I bought another to replace it. The extension does feel a bit flimsy, but it's not too bad. Just don't be rough with it.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Love this paper trimmer.  Very smooth cuts.  Love how you have to push the cutter blade down just a little versus just being loose to slide up and down the trimmer.  ALso really like how the paper holder really stays down and you actually have to lift it a little to pull your paper out easily.  You can do it but it just keeps it from coming out easily by itself.  Only smallest little detail complaint is there is just a 4"" platform and my standard A2 card size that I have to cut all the time is 4.25 x 5.5.  So it took a little bit of adjusting to get the exact measurement for 4.25 because the quarter mark is just right about where the arm extends out and it's hard to see the exact .25 mark.  Once I found it I marked it with a marker so I will always see it.  Also the .25"" lines aren't all the way down the cutter, just the top and bottom.  But for the price, you can't beat it.  I notice on Amazon that the exact same cutter is being sold under all kinds of different names so just go for the cheapest, which this happened to be at the time.  I also got the 4 pack of replacement blades which cost less than the price of 1 replacement blade of Fiskars which is what I used to always use.  Highly recommend this trimmer and would buy again.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Does exactly what I wanted.  In fact, it cuts more pages at one time than I expected it to.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Like that it is compact taking up half the space of my old paper size cutter.  The guide lines are helpful and easy to see.  Just the right price and works well.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"My enjoyment of this item is directly proportional to the number of extra replacement blades I have on hand. For cutting watercolor paper, they dull and tear the paper pretty quickly. On the other hand, the trimmer is more true than my last two - name brand - plastic molded trimmers. It's still off by about a half a degree, but I paid around ten bucks for it (fall 2023), so ok, I guess?",4
B07MP9JQ4W,"I returned the cutter because when I used it...the paper didn't size 5.25x4 even though the markers showed it was. I use it in crafting so, I need it to be accurate .",2
B07MP9JQ4W,Love it. I use it to cut my watercolor paper into smaller sizes and it slices through the thick paper easily.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,This was so very well priced and a sturdy item. I only use this to cut a few pieces at a time but it works very well.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,it worked. that is all i need it to do,5
B07MP9JQ4W,I use this often on different types of paper and it works great.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Well worth the money and a lot more effective than raunchy handled choppers. This thing was $10 and it cut through 9mm plastic (I laminated 3 3mm laminating pouches with 2 pieces of paper inside of it) with ease. I will be keeping it and buying the replacement blades when I need more.Would definitely recommend this to someone.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Great ease of use for card making,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"I just wanted something simple that would cut straight. I am very pleased to say I got that and more. This is perfect. I don't have to worry about it cutting crooked. It comes with a ruler and lines so you can cut at angles. My only complaint, which isn't a huge deal, is that it is tough to cut through card stock, so I think it might be difficult to cut through as much paper as it claims it can.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"cutter works great for small stacks of my flyer on Card stock.  took me a few tries to realize how to line up the flyers with the cut lines, but once i figured that out, it was amazingly simple",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"For some small projects, this think is not bad at all. Does the job well and the measurements are great. However, the sharpness could be better. Some of the paper I was cutting ended up frayed some on the edges. Not a big deal for what I was working on, but may need something different for clean cuts. Not bad for the price though.",4
B07MP9JQ4W,"I bought a Fiskars 5388 6"" Bypass guillotine cutter and it broke the first time I used it -- and the two cuts I made with it before it broke were not perfectly straight.Then I bought this. This cutter costs less, is tremendously accurate, has better features, and is so much easier to use. The fold-out arm is a great feature, the lines for angle cutting are fantastic, and it's even good at cutting thin slivers to precise adjustments. It does feel fairly light, but aside from feeling light, I've found all the components work really well.I've only had it for two days now, but I've cut tons of paper and cardstock in those two days, and about the only thing this cutter is not great for is handmade paper (the pulp strands catch on the blade and pull, so the cut is jagged). Even with that one issue, I'm still giving this a full five stars because it is SO much better than Fiskars. A guillotine will be better for handmade paper, but this slide cutter is fantastic for everything else.UPDATE: Have been using it regularly for over six months now, and it's still a delight! I really can't recommend it enough if you do a lot of cutting.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Este cortador me hace muy feliz, el material es resistente y ligero. En relacion calidad-precio uno de los mejores.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Great Purchase will buy again,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Right size,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Works ok, not the best stability for the item being cut, I had to tape it down in order for it to stay in place, holding it does not help.",4
B07MP9JQ4W,"I tried using it before, but only to cut paper.It is very sharp and I love the safety feature of the blade because I have kids that like touch my stuff, so this will be great to prevent these kinds of injuries.I haven't tried to do any big projects as yet, but I know it'll do the job.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,This is my 2nd purchase of this exact item.  My original fell onto the floor & the arm broke.  I absolutely love this trimmer.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,Easy to use and a good bargain!,4
B07MP9JQ4W,For cutting my paper for my crafts,5
B07MP9JQ4W,There needs to be something to lock it down before you cut. Otherwise it's good,3
B07MP9JQ4W,"This is a great cutter. It did what I needed, which wasn't the easiest of jobs either since it wasn't just paper. Definitely recommend.",5
B07MP9JQ4W,Very well made and easy to use.  Precise and adjustable.,5
B07MP9JQ4W,"works good, i just wish i knew what blade to use as a replacement since they want $10 for just 4 and other offer more for less",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"Small cutter convenient to use, works well, good value",5
B07MP9JQ4W,"I purchased this to create bookmarks. With thicker paper or card stock, I had to slide the cutter about 3-4 times. However, it's decent for the price.",4
B0018NA0F8,Wanted to repair a flag that was a bit tattered.  I don't sew!  Seems okay for now.,4
B0018NA0F8,"What I Did for Hem of Jeans:  trim loose threads.  Leaves fuzzy seam with what looks like two pieces of fabric.  Make puddle of glue, then apply with Que tip or old toothbrush. Use your fingers, squeeze fabric together into single hem.Some areas may be frayed but not separated.  Apply glue, squeeze together with your fingers again. Dries fast.  Glue washes off your fingers quite readily.I am not a pro.  This is what I did and it seemed to work.",5
B0018NA0F8,"After having accidentally caused holes in my new underwear from the misuse of a fabric shaver, I went on the market for fabric glue. After having used this, the holes are mended and it dried clear. After one wash, the glue is still holding up. Great buy so far.",5
B0018NA0F8,Really good product 100% recommend,5
B0018NA0F8,I use this glue a lot will reorder,5
B0018NA0F8,For crafting,5
B0018NA0F8,"This is the first time I've used anything like this, but I just needed to shorten one end on the length of a table runner.  This worked great and didn't have to manually hem it!",5
B0018NA0F8,Used to stuck patches on my backpack. Worked great!,5
B0018NA0F8,"I used it to repair a hole in my Allbirds Tree Dasher.  I wear those  every day for miles - and did not want to keep seeing my socks sticking out of a hole near the toes!  The hole seems to be closed - but it does look like a permanent wet spot now.  The repair is noticeable if you look at it, but really, nobody is going to be examining my shoes closely during a dog walk, so it served its purpose - and will hopefully hold up next time I wash these sneakers.  But may be this glue is better for repairs inside a garment (e.g. pockets) or under another layer of fabric, where any wet looking stains won't be so visible.",4
B0018NA0F8,It was easy to set the hen on the panps,4
B0018NA0F8,"The stitching on my coat pocket liner gave way creating a hole where everything I put in it ended up in the coat liner. I was going to try and sew the pocket but that proved to be nearly impossible because I couldn't get enough of the liner out of the pocket to fix the whole thing. This left me with two choices, find something to glue it together or throw the coat out. As I've never used fabric glue before I went with this one because it had good reviews and was relativley inexpensive. The glue was easy to apply and within 30 seconds or so, it had adhered sufficently enough where I no longer had to hold the two pieces of cloth together. At that point I was able to hang the coat and give the glue 24 hours to completely cure.Rather than being left with a hard seam as I would have if I had used super glue, the seam remains somewhat plyable (a good thing) and well bonded. I've been wearing the coat now for about 3 weeks and the pocket liner is as good as if it had been stitched. So would I recommend it? Based on my experience I would. I really wish that they sold an even smaller bottle however as I suspect it will take me years (many) to use it all up at which time I'm sure it will have hardened in the bottle.",5
B0018NA0F8,Liquid Stitch has been the best fabric glue I have ever used. I use it for crafts & hems when I sew. I usually buy the small .5 oz but this 4 oz. Bottle is great value for the price. The tip on the bottle makes it easy to use like a pen.,5
B0018NA0F8,"I got this Liquid Stitch for keeping the ends of cotton yarn in check on a crochet project. I will say it's pretty easy to use, I just used a combination of q-tips and my fingers to apply it to the yarn, and it dries fairly quickly. It comes off of skin easily with soap and water. However, the strength/adhesion leaves something to be desired. I had to redo a few spots. I wonder if it works differently on different materials? I wouldn't expect this to completely replace thread as it claims to; I think it works better as a fray check/for small areas.",4
B0018NA0F8,Never used fabric glue before & this product worked excellent. Saves me a lot of sewing time. Have washed the clothes a few times and have had no problem with it coming undone. Excellent product. Great price also.,5
B0018NA0F8,"I used Liquid Stitch on some slack seams. So far, holding well. The liquid doesn't show. I will see what happens after I wash my slacks.",4

B0018NA0F8,AFTER THREE ORDERS I BELIEVE I HAVE RIGHT ONE COMING.,5
B0018NA0F8,It works great love it,5
B0018NA0F8,My mom used to hem my pants until her hands quit (thanks mom!)  I tried this because my local seamstress had a 6 week delivery time.  This glue works!  No hem I've glued has come loose.  If you're careful about how the fabric lies when you fold it to make the hem the gluing looks as good as a professional sewing job (I didn't at first).,5
B0018NA0F8,"I'm a guy, I rip the crotch of my pants out at times. A little hand stitching and coating with this and they have lasted a long time. I fixed half a dozen pairs I had laying around. When dry it's not scratchy, similar to a  rubber cement texture. I got two bottles but one is huge and it doesn't take much to do the job. Wish I had known about this a long time ago!",5
B0018NA0F8,"I'm a boondocker, a retired guy who lives in a bus to save money. Part of saving money is repairing clothes instead of replacing them, and I've been using Liquid Stitch for years to do that. It doesn't last forever, but if I glue a pocket or a belt loop back on or glue a patch over a torn spot, it holds up through a lot of use and many washings. As with any other glue, you need to apply the right amount and clamp the pieces together until the glue sets.I still keep some sewing gear around for buttons and such, but I use Liquid Stitch for all other cloth repairs. I'd recommend it to a friend.",5
B0018NA0F8,"I do not (can not)sew... but do like to DIY a lot of different items for my home... have made pillows in the past using different types of adhesion this glue was far superior in my opinion than any of the fabric glue I have tried in the past . Watched a video that used liquid stitch to make pillow covers very glad that I ordered it and followed her recommendation easy to use, came out of tube evenly ... consistency was not too thick nor too thin. Definitely recommend in place of sewing for fabric projects",5
B0018NA0F8,"I have been ironing on the Girl Scout patches to the vest and no matter what, they are all lifting. I ordered this product and dabbed some on all of the ends of the patches that are lifting, and it worked like a charm. I have not used it on a whole patch yet, but it seems like it will work just fine. no staining on the other side of the fabric. Overall, I am happy.",5
B0018NA0F8,"I had asked the previous reviewer (""concerned parent"") about its washability and she was most kind to answer in the positive.  I would like to add a few other good points.It's white, like Elmer's, and it dries perfectly clear (give it the full 24 hours if possible) IF you apply it thinly and evenly (a big glob would never be clear because the interior of the glob would never get air enough to cure it).  NOTE: Elmer's won't hold up in the wash!Other fabric glues may SAY that they dry clear but actually turn a hideous brown with a little time.  This does stay clear.If I am going to use it to apply something like rick rack or an applique I use a quality flat watercolor brush to evenly apply it to the underside.  And since it does cure so slowly it is no problem having enough time to clean the brushes and the bottle's top with warm soapy water (no different than if you were painting with acrylics).Also store the bottle of Liquid Stitch upright with the tip tightly closed OR alternatively you could place a little clear plastic to the top of the bottle before you screw the clean tip back on.SUGGESTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO BOTTLE THE LIQUID STITCH: Why Don't You Have A Temporary Seal (Like They Have On Catsup Or Mustard) on A New Bottle!  I had to struggle clearing the solidly clogged glue in the top and tip - so much that I nearly tossed it!NOTE: it is a bit toxic so wash your hands well and even then be careful not to rub your eyes.  As I learned the hard way.What a fun and useful tool to add to my sewing supplies!",5
B0018NA0F8,It works but kind of messy,4
B0018NA0F8,"While I probably wouldn't use this on dress clothing it's a very useful for other clothes and makes a very durable bond. Be sure to use it very sparingly as any excess will not be easily removed. I recommend applying it with the tip of a toothpick and apply to the back side if possible. I snagged the knee of a pair of work pants kneeling on my deck when I caught a screw. I've used those pants for laying flooring since and it held up to repetitive kneeling. I also snagged a down insulated nylon vest. I repaired it with a very sparing application to the outer surface. Although, upon close inspection you can see that it leaves a shiny surface where it's applied. If you repair an item before the edges have time to fray it will only be minimally noticeable, much less so than any kind of patch, yet just as strong.",5
B0018NA0F8,"No response to my three customer support e mails to them about the product being in un useable. At over 10$ a tube and I've bought this same product for over 6 years, have recommended this product often,  i think they should give me a refund or replace with useable product!",5
B0018NA0F8,Works wonderful on my leather sofa and my jacket.  And it dries clear:-),5
B0018NA0F8,"It's so easy to just pour some glue on the seam line, place the other piece on top, press a little and the seam is ready to sew! Goodbye, pins.",5
B0018NA0F8,Used for work pants that were too long. Just simply rolled up and stitched down. The adhesion is very durable and has withstood many washings. Also works great for patching holes in pockets.,5
B0018NA0F8,"I bought this to attach a fabric patch to the fabric of swim trunks (poly/cotton blend) for a water park anime convention cosplay. I followed all the instructions, and the adhesion seemed great when everything was dry. I gave it a solid week to cure, and to reiterate, it seemed nice and secure out of water. The info claims this is waterproof once cured.After a few hours of being in the pool area, the glue started to peel. I ended up using some normal Gorilla glue (only cured overnight) on the points that started to peel off, and the patch held the rest of the weekend. Overall, I'm not impressed.",3
B0018NA0F8,Good deal fast shipping works good,5
B0018NA0F8,"I've repaired two squishies and fixed the hem on a pair of pants. So far, I'm happy with this product.",5
B0018NA0F8,Patched my jeans. And washed and put in the cloths dryer. Did this several times. Mending stayed together. Very happy with this product,5
B0018NA0F8,Love this stuff,5
B0018NA0F8,"Seems like an OK product, but it's kind of thin, so it's hard to get it to stick and cover even a small hole. I had to go over multiple times letting it dry to get it to work. Would recommend something more like putty.",3
B0018NA0F8,"I am loving this product. I wanted to try liquid no sew glue after buying a bench for my backyard. The bench cushions available for purchase were 1 1/2 inch thick and I didn't love the patterns. I already had cushions that were 2 1/2 inches thick. Much more comfortable, and wanted to put my own cover on it using blackout curtains without sewing.I first bought a flexible fabric glue that's geared towards embroidery. It wasn't a great hold and hard to control the amount you wish to use. I searched around and found this. It works great. Goes on white but dries clear. Easy to control the amount you wish to use whether thick or thin line. I used it on the stitching of my work pants and fix the spots on my cushion that wasn't glued properly. I can pull on it and it stays. Already recommended to another coworker.",5
B0018NA0F8,I use this to secure the knots in my crochet projects.  Stays soft and secures the knot in the yarn.  Flexible after washing.,5
B0018NA0F8,I've used this before for patches on karate uniforms.,5
B0018NA0F8,(5.22.22)Made this 21x19 jumbo knot pillow from a youtube tutorial and it came out so good! I applied the glue in foot long sections and let each dry for 40 minutes before moving on to the next section and it dried so strong. It didn't even budge while I was stuffing the tube. I also used it to secure mosquito netting to my diy pvc pipe pest protection im building for my tomatoes.Definitely recommend for sewing projects but I would only buy from Amazon or Prime just in case you get a dried up tube. I cant speak to the lasting time but will update if the pillow suddenly falls apart.,5
B0018NA0F8,"It pretty much never fully dries. I sewed a ripped pocket on my jeans and covered the stitching with this, and it holds, but every time I reach into the pockets, this compound smashes around. My phone sometimes sticks to it, too.",4
B0018NA0F8,This is a good clothing glue to hem up your pants without sewing the price is a little bit steep but I really needed it,5
B0018NA0F8,Loved it  work perfect,5
B0018NA0F8,"I have used Liquid Stitch before, to repair small holes in t-shirts. I thought this larger tube would be the same product, with more of it. When I received it, the instructions indicate that you should not apply it from the tube. The packaging suggests using a craft stick or toothpick. I don't happen to have craft sticks at home. Well, using a toothpick was not effective at all! I couldn't get enough of the product on the material in order to close the hole in the fabric. After several attempts, I thought, ""well, what's the harm in applying it directly from the tube, if I make sure not to get it everywhere?"" Well, I didn't get it everywhere. But a lot came out (that I then spread around with the aforementioned toothpick). The holes didn't really close up. And I guess when you use too much, because you didn't follow the instructions, it dries a thick yellow color. Not pretty. If you have craft sticks, I say give this a try. If you don't, stick with purchasing the smaller tube which can be used directly on the fabric.",3
B0018NA0F8,I had a skirt that was too long to wear that sat in my closet for 2 years waiting to be hemmed up.  My daughter told me to get this product. It truly just took a few minutes it was ready to wear! Awesome!,5
B0018NA0F8,Arrived with a broken tip that they knew about because it was wrapped in plastic. Decided to try to use it anyways but this is simple white school glue not for fabric.,1
B0018NA0F8,"Works great. Keep in mind, on soft fabric there will be a tough inflexible glue line if you put it on too thick. I squeeze on a bead of fabric glue along a tear and immediately dab excess with a wet sponge. Reduce to only enough to restrict the fabric from unraveling. Then go back and stitch the tear shut ... ... ... ALSO. REMEMBER TO let the glue dry, and you should lay the fabric on a parchment paper to keep it from sticking while drying (I discovered that the hard way) ... ... ... I was surprised to be able to use a similar technique to repair a 1/2"" tear in tough cowhide leather work gloves. First the fine stitching then the glue, to seal a wound in these waterproof gloves. Look like new until you look close.",5
B0018NA0F8,"I mostly repair denim jeans. I spread glue on the patch and around the repair area, position the patch with at least 1/2 inch [1 inch or more is better depending on conditionof fabric] boarder around the tear and place on a flat surface with weight on the patch for 24 hours. Wax paper prevents unwanted adhesion where necessary.Stands up to repeated washing and heavy use. Been doing this for years and never had a patch done this way fail.Great stuff!",5
B0018NA0F8,"Thrifted a beautiful purple 100% cashmere sweater for $9, but didn't notice it had a small tear in the fabric on the back until I got home. Ordered this to try and save it bc I really liked it, but the glue didn't dry like I thought it would. I read that it dries clear so I expected the dried consistency to be less thick and tacky like it is in the photo. The hole was less noticeable than the fix :( I should've turned it inside out before applying bc the inside looks much better",3
B0018NA0F8,"I'm no seamster so this is a big help in adjusting the length of pant legs. I cannot seem to find casual slacks that will fit both my waist and my rather short legs. The solution is to fold over the hem the fasten, taking about an inch off the length and Liquid Stitch works perfectly for this. My only criticism is that the squeeze bottle is incredibly hard to open. But once that hurdle is surmounted, clear sailing.'UPDATE: If I thought it difficult getting out of the container initially, you should have seen me when I went back to do some more. After the container is opened, this glue becomes almost impossible to work with. Finially got a channel opened with a variety of sharp tools, and had to squeeze so hard even then that it was also oozing out through the threads on the top and dripping all over. I finished up what I had to do today, threw the rest away and ordered a fresh container for for the next use. It sticks just fine but it is very difficult to work with. They need a better dispenser unless the plan is to have customers do what I did, keep buying fresh for each use.",3
B0018NA0F8,Easy to use. Holds up well in washer.,5
B0018NA0F8,"I applied this on my white t-shirt whose hem started to come undone. It stopped the hem but after a few washes has left a dark stain where the glue was applied. And I applied it on the underside so this is bleed through. The product works. Just a warning that nothing will replace real stitches for the best result. I would buy again, but now I will choose more wisely where to use it.",3
B0018NA0F8,I have used this item before.You can wash your item numerous times,5
B0018NA0F8,got what I ordered and product did what I wanted it to do,5
B0018NA0F8,Easy to use,5
B0018NA0F8,"Bought this to fix a huge tear (6-8 inches) in a couch cushion. I applied it in two-inch increments and used straight pins to hold the fabric together while it dried. I made several applications to ensure that it would stay. After it dried, you'd never know that I used a glue. It's been several weeks and it's shown no signs of coming unglued-- even with my dog digging and sleeping on it.I've also used it to mend pajama pants that have ripped at the crotch and fix a hole in the corner of a down-stuffed throw pillow. It's worked tremendously well for all of these.My only complaint is the smell when it's first applied. It doesn't linger for very long, but it is quite pungent.",5
B0018NA0F8,as described,5
B0018NA0F8,I was surprised that it worked . I used on  Lululemon,5
B0018NA0F8,Exactly what I needed!,5
B0018NA0F8,Not clear like expected . White looks like Elmer's. Drys clear though. Would try different type next time.  Doesn't dry fast or adhere fast but does work if allowed to setup overnight. Pretty messy.,2
B0018NA0F8,"I purchased this to add fabric patches to a shirt. The patches were for cosmetic reasons and varied in size. The glue worked beautifully, it easily adhered and remained in place even after washing. It has given me wonderful ideas for other projects. The glue is the perfect consistency also.",5
B0018NA0F8,Works and only needs a little bit cause it goes a long way,5
B0018NA0F8,"Had a small hole in a cotton t shirt. Dabbed a bit of this on the back side. When it dried, the hole was no no longer visible.",5
B0018NA0F8,"I just used it for the first time, so I can't really say.  I have to wash the item a few times before i can critique it fairly. So far, so good.",4
B0018NA0F8,I have bought this item 3 times online.  Only once has it been good.  The 1st tube was busted in shipping.  2nd tube was okay.  3rd tube was dried out and unusable. And the return window has closed.  I will buy local from now on.  The product itself works when I can get a working tube.,3
B0018NA0F8,worked great,5
B0018NA0F8,I purchased this tube of liquid stitch expecting to be able to glue and patch some articles of clothing of mine and that is exactly what I could not do with this I read the instructions I shook the two trying to mix it up before I used it for the first time applied it to the clothing like you're supposed to and it would not even hold the fabric after I pinched it together not even for a second nowhere I tried it would it adhere any fabric together complete and total waste of my money I don't know if that tube somehow has expired or something happened to it to make it go bad if glue can go bad but still complete waste of my money very unhappy,1
B0018NA0F8,"After trying another liquid hem glue with horrible results, I tried Liquid Stitch! As you can see, the curtain material is textured and it worked perfectly and dried in 30 minutes! The first photo is the inside hem and the second photo is what it looks like from the outside.  The wider the hem, the better. Because of the uneven cut from the original hem, I did have to work a bit more to press the areas that had less than an inch.  Easy clean up. Highly recommend.",5
B0018NA0F8,"I bought it to turn a plain white t-shirt into cold shoulders with a finish. It did a good job. It took a practice run to get the amout correct. A little goes a very long ways. One tube will probably dry up before I ever finish it. Wouldn't recommend on any type of nicer clothing or fabric but for fun stuff, it's great.",5
B0018NA0F8,Use for putting patches on holes in jeans and other clothes.  Works the best!!,4
B0018NA0F8,"Used it to ""stitch"" my loose bra and it's holding up to the task.  I haven't washed yet  to test how it fairs after washing but I figured I could always reapply, if needed.",5
B0018NA0F8,Needed to repair holes in cargo shorts near the pockets.  Tried sewing the holes and it didn't work as the material needed reinforcement.  The Iron-on patches weren't strong enough as fabric softener or dryer heat will remove the adhesive.  This did the trick to save 3 out of 4 pairs of shorts for the summer heat!,5
B0018NA0F8,Had three rag rugs that had been giving to me by my aunt and were over one hundred years old.  The braided portion of the rug was in good shape.  The binding was rotten and would not hold together.  Put them on a table top with wax paper under them. The glue was used between the braids as replacement for the binding.  Well please with the results.,5
B00DUSKPUE,"We bought this for the purpose of making various origamis, including 3D origami, which we use a cutter to cut into smaller pieces and it works excellent. It doesn't tear easily which is awesome when working with all kinds of origami. Highly recommend and the colors are vibrant!!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"To begin with, these are not exactly ""origami"" origami paper. They are not thin like the japanese origami paper.That being said, I have to say these are superb. About three shades per color (gray black - and white is easy to produce; pink violet purple; red orange darker orange; lime green dark green; 3 shades of blue; orange yellow light yellow) I have to say, this is perfect for making kusudama, which I am mainly interested in. Most kusudama calls from 30 to 60 pieces, and there are 25 sheets per color so it should be easy to make about 10 kusudamas. The papers being thick help me in this regard, as you want a thicker paper to do this.If you are doing kusudama and want a smaller sized paper, this may not be the best, since they are quite large. If you are going for bigger ones (as I am) I highly recommend it.For beginner origami, the colors are great. They are the same color on both sides so you might get confused with some models if you are a beginner, but other than that they are perfect. But this paper definitely is not for the hardest models (not big enough for something like Satoshi Kamiya's dragons) but still I think you will get beautiful moderately-complex models if that is what you are going for.I suggest you get a cutting station if you think you will be using different size of papers, there are pretty good ones on amazon.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Nice quality, double sided paper, easy to work with.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Perfect size for many origami creations, and the sheer amount of color options is a plus.",5
B00DUSKPUE,The origami paper is a very good paper for beginners to intermediate level.  The paper is not as thin as others but holds up very well; it did not rip easily. The colors are very vibrant and even after you make a lot of folds and crease it the edges are still that color; others just have a top coat of color and once folded it will leave a white crease at the fold line.  I was able to make a good variety of flowers and leaves of different levels with little to no issue.  The paper depending on the color will slightly vary in thickness and texture; enough were I did notice.  I highly recommend this origami paper and I will definitely use this again for more projects!,5
B00DUSKPUE,One of the #1 requirements for origami paper is that it is square. This whole box of paper did not have square corners and threw all folds slightly off. This was very frustrating for my daughter who was trying to learn and practice.,1
B00DUSKPUE,"Definitely get a bang for your buck! Beautiful colors, plenty of variety. Durable. My 12 year old daughter has a blast creating with these!",5
B00DUSKPUE,Folds well,5
B00DUSKPUE,Exactly what I expected and good quality.,5
B00DUSKPUE,"The outer packaging was fine, but the plastic that had held the origami paper was torn off.  As a result, all of the origami paper was bent up and in bad shape.",2
B00DUSKPUE,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This paper is thicker, dull and the white is not white. I ran out of black and white halfway through folding a chess board and bought this to finish. Now I have to order more paper somewhere else because this paper quality is so much lower than the paper I had been using.",2
B00DUSKPUE,I love this paper! The color selection is so bright and so beautiful!  I use this paper not only for origami but also for deco page crafts. It's perfectly weighted and has consistent color throughout. It is a smart purchase.,5
B00DUSKPUE,"This paper is nice stuff. Really nice. The color appears to be all the way through the paper, so there are no white seams along the fold lines. Paper holds the creases very well and rarely ripped, so that's a bonus. It did rip a bit, along the seams of some very tiny folds, but I have yet to find a paper that doesn't rip at some point, I mean, it *is* paper.The variety and quantity of colors in this pack was excellent. The richness of the color is lovely - bold, bright colors and some paler, softer colors - all in one huge pack! Sweet!I didn't look at the ebook, so I can't review that.I was contacted by the seller for feedback on what I thought of the paper and since then, they've contacted me twice to ask me to leave feedback here on Amazon. Not cool. It worked, I'm leaving feedback, but I would have anyway when I'd had more of a chance to really play with the paper. Emailing me twice though to pester me about leaving feedback? Not cool at all, and I dinged a star because of it.Overall: Great paper but not thrilled about being emailed twice to leave feedback.",4
B00DUSKPUE,No SurprisesNo IssuesNo Problems,5
B00DUSKPUE,"I first started doing origami back in the early 1970s when I was at school, having been inspired by magician Robert Harbin's TV series.I got quite good at it, and worked my way through book after book of ever-more complex designs, but my favourite all-time thing to make always was the flapping bird (see one of the customer images) - I must have made hundreds in my time, from really large ones to tiny ones too.As time went on, I lost interest for a while, only rekindling it when I needed an origami model for my Magic Squares book.But that was over eight years ago now, so I thought it was time I brought this hobby back to life again.I am badly out of practice, so I knew I'd need a whole bunch of origami paper to work with, so this bundle of 500 colourful sheets seemed like a really good deal. That means I can afford to make quite a few mistakes as I relearn this creative art.The colours really are vibrant, and I love the fact they are coloured on both sides, unlike the paper I used to buy years ago.The size and thickness are just right, and they retain the creases really well.All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase - all I need to do now is dig out my origami books from storage.  :-)",5
B00DUSKPUE,Go these for my 8yo son that is very into origami. They work perfectly for him. The packaging did cause a handful of sheets to be creased. We used them for scrap paper instead.,5
B00DUSKPUE,"I cut ""snowflakes"" throughout the year. In the winter I make flakes, I cut elaborate doilies at Valentines time, flowers in the warm months, and various designs and words throughout the year. I wanted paper that was colored through and through and this is that. (Most origami paper is colored on the outside, so when it's cut, the color chips away at the edges.) Because this paper is solidly colored, it is good for kirigami.This paper is a good value. Nice bright colors in a great array: black, brown, light brown, dark red, red, orange, dark pink, purple, lavender, forest green, green, light green, dark blue, light blue, sky blue, dark yellow, yellow, pale yellow, cream (and maybe even more colors). Paper is good quality. I do wish it were consistently a bit thinner--the dark colors especially are a bit thick for my purposes. Still, I'm happy I bought this.One of the best aspects of this purchase was the personalized customer service. Business owner Susan sent a very nice follow-up email, and this personalized touch added even more value to what I feel was already a wise purchase.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I received the paper on time and it has worked perfectly for my purposes.  I mostly fold as a hobby, but occasionally use my skill as a tool for various projects.  This was one of those cases, and I used about 50 sheets from the excellent selection of colors to produce a bouquet as a Valentine's Day gift (Kawasaki Roses and a few others for variety) and as part of a small teaching activity for a children's group I help out with (I taught them to fold waterbombs and cranes).  The quality was a great improvement over using typical paper available, and the quantity and selection provided for the price were fantastic in my opinion.  Should I need to order more paper after somehow using up 500 sheets, I will remember this order for such a purchase.  My only complaint would be that the paper is not consistent in its texture, as some colors feel nearly as light as tissue paper while others are comparable to construction paper.  I do not know if this has to do with the specific dyes, but it can cause issues with more intricate folding.",4
B00DUSKPUE,This paper frays when you try to put a crisp edge on it and if feels like someone just cut up construction paper. Not a fan.,2
B00DUSKPUE,When ordering this product all the pictures to view look like regular sized paper. When receiving the paper and was way smaller than expected. I did not see where it stated 2 different sizes. Should have been a little more clear with photos.,2
B00DUSKPUE,"I am a novice with Origami and apparently there are a myriad of paper types to use. I chose this paper because of the reviews on Amazon which mostly said the paper was the best buy for the price (for those of us not looking to spend on the most expensive paper available).I have enjoyed the choices of color this pack provides and the amount of paper to work with. Not knowing how paper is supposed to work best with origami, (I suppose certain origami artworks would require different grades/thicknesses of paper?), I am pleased with my purchase...as is my little granddaughter who thinks origami is ""awesome"".I have found your paper easy to work with, although when doing a butterfly with many foldovers, the paper becomes harder to crease down, but I suspect this would be for any paper unless it was so thin as to be transparent which would lead me to tear the paper I am sure.  I have rated this paper 4 stars because it does not tear easily for me, there are several choices of colors.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"This paper is double sided meaning it has color on both sides. My teen does a lot of origami and this paper is some of her favorite, especially for designs you want colored on both sides. Our first packages arrived pristine! Our latest package was wrecked!  My teen likes this origami paper and was sad at the state of the second package as it was completely unusable. Thankfully, Amazon allowed us to return it. Hopefully the next package will once again be pristine!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"I was really not happy with this paper.I used to fold origami when I was a child and the paper I used was always very thin and often had a light gloss to it. It was very easy to work with and one was able to accomplish very intricate folds.My seven year old is very into folding origami, so I purchased this paper.  He uses it happily, but thinner paper provides the potential to yield a much better end result.Some of the colors in this package of origami paper seems thinner and more ideal to use for origami folding, but many of them feel like the weight of plain copy or printer paper.I also wish I had gone with a double sided paper.  (One that has a different color on each side.)  It is helpful to have the contrasting colors when folding because it acts as a guideline and will be obvious if things aren't lined up properly; which I prefer because it makes it so you would like things up properly.  For some reason I assumed the back side would be plain white as many origami papers are .  It might obviously state that is not the case on the product description, so that may be my fault.  This really just doesn't strike me as actual origami paper.  It's cut to a square and colorful  and those are the only star deserving things about it.I'm honestly pretty disappointed with this purchase.*** an update. The title listing says double sided , but in the description itself it says same color both sides.  Extremely deceiving. Makes me even more unhappy with this.",2
B00DUSKPUE,"I have purchased origami paper in the past, but in smaller quantities than 500 sheets.  Gave it away as a gift, and it was certainly a hit, so I'm back for a larger quantity of paper this time.There is plenty of paper in this pack, all in excellent colors.  This paper is strong and doesn't tear so easily, so it can withstand the creasing and folding required of origami designs.Origami paper is one thing, but trying to figure out what to DO with it is quite another.  This paper comes with an easily downloadable ebook with 100 designs, from simple to more complex, with quite an emphasis on ever-popular animals.  And, seriously, some of the designs in the ebook are quite remarkable ... but with the simple, straightforward instructions, are also quite ""doable.""This paper will be a gift, as well, for another of my friend's daughters.  It will give her plenty of ways to exercise her already vivid imagination, as well as keeping her and her friends busy for a while.  And that equates to ""Brownie Points"" for ME, to be sure!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Not a real origami paper; it gets ripped too easily. It is a fun pack of 500 colored paper, which worth the prize - just keep in mind that it is not really for folding.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"I purchased these so I would have something to learn during shutdown, thought I was buying full-sized origami sheets and just getting a good deal.  When they came in the mail they are TINY, smaller than your average post-it note.  Ended up not returning them since I wanted to challenge myself.  They're a lot of fun if you are patient but if you're new to origami it can be pretty difficult to get the little folds on something so small.  Now the origami is even more impressive since it's small. I added a photo so you can see how little this is.  The rabbit, sting ray and classic crane are all about the size of a US penny, the paper starts to get a little brittle after many folds making it difficult to keep nice creases.",5
B00DUSKPUE,to be authentic origami paper.,4
B00DUSKPUE,"This smaller size is at the same time both better and worse to work with than the 6"" folding paper from the same company.  The 2"" is at least mostly cut square and while it does not fight the folds, being so small makes it a different sort of challenge.  Feels the same as the 6"", think very thin construction paper, but does not tear as easily.  The inclusion of metallic sheets was a surprise and a novellty I was not expecting but the stuff is nearly impossible to work with.  Too stiff with little give and wages war for each fold.  I've taken to folding one metallic each time I finish 10 other colors and I dread when all that is left are the metallic papers.  As for the 6"" a code for $ off the next purchase was included but I would rather go back to off brand post it note type squares for smaller origami folding.  Not sure I ever want to fold those metallic papers ever again.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"We have been very happy with this purchase.  My kid needed to make a bunch of origami for a school project.  The quality is great for our purposes....way better then when we were trying to use construction paper.  It's thin enough to fold easily, but not so much that it would rip.  The squares all seem just the tinniest shy of actual 6x6, basically as close as possible.  The pack included all the colors shown, I didn't count or anything but appeared to be all in equal amounts.  Not sure ""vivid"" would be quite the right description.  vivid to me implies a bit more brightness, so some of the deeper colors maybe, but they are not dull either. So again, i think it's fine for our needs.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Packaged well, shipped quickly, distinct colours, double-sided, straight edges. For a first-time origami folding pack, it's practically perfect.Not sure why anybody would rate it lowly, it's origami paper. It's exactly as it needs to be. Sized and cut correctly, and easy to fold. Not as thick as construction paper, but thicker than Japanese classic origami paper. Hence, perfect for beginners or practice paper.Did come with a link (and discount code) under the product page for an ebook, not as good as Tuttle, but hey, you're buying this for the paper not the instructions. Google, YouTube, or Tuttle is what you want for instructions.Very happy with this purchase, and completely recommend.(It's just paper guys, go make some cranes and calm down.)Cheers.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Several days after this package arrived, the owner of Origami Craze sent me an email asking for my feedback on his product. Since I had ordered the paper for my niece, I asked her to answer his email. Here's her response:""Hello! I have loved the paper! Though most of the time I like when tutorials have paper that is white on one side (so you know where to start) for other projects it is very useful to have fully colored paper. The creases stay in very nicely, too! Thanks! -Murp""The owner then sent back a nice email thanking my niece for her evaluation. I post that exchange here to illustrate two points. First, this company cares about what it's customers think. Second, the person in my family who used this paper loved it. All that is worth 5 stars in my opinion.",5
B00DUSKPUE,I bought this product in june and have been using it quite reguarly since then.  I wanted to buy something inexpensive but opted for these because of quantity and quality concerns. Overall I'm happy with the product and would reccomend. The paper itslef is quite good and makes crisp folds. Its is not too thin which I like because it avoids tears in the middle of folds. I've made differnt type of orgami creations with this paper such as the pictures I included above and have found no problems with the texture. The colors are great for making colorful cubes and flowers.,4
B00DUSKPUE,"Pros:- Colors are nice- Lots of sheets for a pretty good price- The papers are all the same size. Some origami paper that I've bought before was cut unevenlyCons:- The texture is not what I want from origami paper. It feels like construction paper mixed with origami paper. It's ok though, I'm still planning on using it.Note: This origami paper is not for people who are seriously into origami and want the right texture. It is good for beginners. I would not give it to someone who is more advanced at origami.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"The picture above is what the product looked like when I pulled it out of the Amazon packaging. The plastic covering was already partially ripped off and the papers were bent/torn at the corners. I wasn't going to bother writing a review about it but then I downloaded the ""free e-book"" of origami how-to that was advertised on the package and it's utter garbage. Pictures and words are low resolution and hard to see, and the instructions are not clear or easy to follow. Don't waste your time",2
B00DUSKPUE,"I have been enjoying this product since I wanted some tiny pages for origami. The sheets almost like construction paper, a little pulpy and soft, though still thin enough to work a crane. The colors are bold and rich with nice variation. There are several metallic sheets (gold, silver and copper) that are a different paper altogether - almost plastic. There are a little more challenging to fold, but they make for a dynamic piece once completed. All papers are same color on both sides, not one color and then white. A good inexpensive option for some tiny working.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Great for making mini swans, cranes, hearts, boats and other origami designs that are not too complicated. Love the gold, silver and bronze foil sheets included in it as well.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Paper colors are as shown.  I've used 325 sheets from two packs.  The paper thickness is not consistent.  The darker colors tend to be thicker and the lighter color tend to be thinner.  This did not matter much to my purposes, but the thicker sheets makes some of the more precise folds (especially those at the end where you are folding many layers) challenging. In generally, most of the sheets are thicker than origami paper I have used in the past.  I have noticed 2 or 3 sheets (of the 325 I've used) had small holes.  I have found that the sheets are square. Overall, I would recommend this product unless your projects need consistent paper thickness.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I am not an expert at origami but now and then I try it. I bought this paper to make some Kusudamas to present to my friends for Christmas. At the beginning, because I had to try folding and unfolding till I got it right, the paper ripped at some points, but as soon as I got the hand of it (I finally understood the instructions) no other paper has broken. The colors are very nice and the paper has the right thickness to fold easily and stay where it has to.  The colors are firm and do not transfer to my hands and no white appear at the creases. I like this product a lot, and also its container which makes it very easy to store it and to find the color I need. It is also at a very good price compared to what I can find locally.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"I bought this paper to make 1000 cranes with. It's beautifully colored and doesn't tear easily, which is nice.The darker colored paper, especially green and blue have a more worn and frail texture so that's a little odd.It seems to be similar to construction paper and is good for beginners, although it does make it hard to get all the folds exact.Overall I'm pleased with this paper and I think it worked well for my project.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"Pros:-Great value for the amount of paper you get-Solid, vibrant colors-Good beginner origami paper for those wanting to learn and experiment with the craft-My order had no issues with the quality of the paper and everything was cut perfectly.-Origami produced with this paper is quite sturdy.Cons:-It's a bit thicker/heavier than other types of origami paper I used.  This is not typically a problem if you're wanting a sturdy origami product.  However, if you're like me and have weak hand strength (thanks, carpal tunnel), the sturdier paper may make your folding more difficult.All in all, a good purchase.  Very happy with the product.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I wish some comes with color on one side.  There are some folding projects that needs a color contrast.  With both sides of paper being the same color, the contrast cannot be made.  I wish I had ordered some papers with the back side white.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"Offers a variety of vibrant colors at a good price. Just wish it came in a box to hold it in. I haven't had any problems with it otherwise. I've been using this paper for about six months now. It makes for some good origami paper. These are indeed perfect squares, idk what some of these reviewers are talking about.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"This paper differs from other paper in that it has a soft cloth-like feel.  I liked the vibrant colors,dyed throughout colors and the way it takes on rounded shapes.  However, it is thicker than standard paper, limiting the complexity of the models possible.  That was my biggest frustration.  For example, most but not all of the models in John Montroll's Dinosaurs for Beginners could be folded.  It is too soft for many ""locks"" used to keep modular models together.  It seems to be a good paper for wet folding.It's a good paper for certain kinds of folding, but it does have it's limitations.  I'd be very interested in seeing larger sizes available.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I was specifically looking for small papers.  What I did not expect was for them to be double sided, including the metallic papers (yes, I know it says that the metallics are double sided in the description).  It's not easy finding double sided metallic papers.  In addition to the typical gold and silver color, there was also a metallic copper.  If you've been folding and like small papers, this is really nice paper.  Not really for beginners.",4
B00DUSKPUE,The choice of colors is very good. Easy to fold. Darker colors are a bit more sturdy but they're just fine overall. Would buy again and would recommend this seller.,5
B00DUSKPUE,This paper is great. It isn't terribly thick so if you make a misfold it can be forgiving. It is a great paper for practicing new designs or learning origami and the size makes it great for kids too. I only wish I would have bought the case for the paper because it is a bit hard for me to keep it totally safe in my bag. I'm really happy with them so far and am using this size to perfect my origami skill so I can move down to a smaller size. It also comes with a direction booklet download and a coupon for future purchase which is great. (just dont throw away the top page like I did because that is where the coupon is! cheers!,5
B00DUSKPUE,"Colors are great. Good, all around paper for normal origami projects.Perfect for kusudama balls for two reasons: Slight texture makes it easy to use school glue, and there are plenty of sheets of each color.Good for making roses bc it's the same color both sides, but does not have quite as nice finish that higher quality paper has.It's nicer than construction paper. Its just as easy to fold as higher quality paper. I would use this paper for any of my projects.Some projects may call for better paper.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"My 9 year old has fallen on love with teaching herself origami. We have been doing all kinds of activities while stating safe at home during the coronavirus pandemic.I first observed her practicing with torn out pages of magazines. I thought ""what the heck is she doing?""...until she gave me an origami elephant. It was then that I decided to order your origami paper.My order arrived next day, not even 24 hours after it was submitted. We love the paper. It's perfect for a beginner...& the price was fair.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"i would have liked this to be a bit thicker, as it was tearing a bit when i folded it. i am a beginner, as this is why i chose this. but i have tried thicker papers and they have been more durable. although, this is good paper for kids. I was able to string yarn through it. i made paper cranes.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"Nice paper, love all the colors!!However, the texture is more like construction paper.  If you work it too much it will lose its strength, and I've had folds start to open up.  If you're doing less advanced origami, this would be great.  However, if you're doing something a bit more challenging, even if you do each fold perfect, with little overwork, you still get that loss of texture/strength, etc...I got this to replace my normal paper which has color only on one side (the other side being white).  However I prefer my old paper.  I am going to find another origami colors both sides paper as I'm not the biggest fan of this.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"The paper is sized well, the colors are beautiful, and it folds well. I wasn't aware that the paper is colored on both sides; however, in my case that doesn't make a difference. My package came earlier than expected, though the paper was only wrapped in shrink wrap, and the package was damaged in shipping/handling (since the shrink wrap offers little to no protection, about 100 sheets had bent corners, though for the price it's still not an enormous problem).Plus, the free ebook is decent, has designs fit for beginner-intermediate but nothing spectacular. Overall, if you're just starting out with origami, this package deal should give you everything necessary.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I bought this paper since there were several reviews saying it was too thick for origami/more like cardstock, and I wanted it for a mixed media project - those reviews are all wildly incorrect. This paper is very thin, though not as thin as tissue paper, and is very clearly origami paper. It's beautiful and photographs vividly, so I'm still very happy with the purchase and will continue using it, but it is absolutely in no way thick or ""close to cardstock""",5
B00DUSKPUE,Muy lindos y de buena calidad,5
B00DUSKPUE,"I wrote an earlier (negative) review, because my paper arrived NOT enclosed in any packaging, and therefore completely bent/crumpled/unusable.I'm pleased to say after I registered my complaint, a new, fully-intact package of paper arrived promptly! Thank you!! My students are very pleased and are enjoying all the colors :) Great product for art room use!",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I ordered this for my grandson's birthday, and he really liked it.  The paper has a good feel, and folds well.  I would have given 5 stars, but the paper packaging was torn open and I had to put it back into a stack.  It was missing some of the wrapping, so I know it was put into the shipping mailer that way.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"My grandson and I are certainly enjoying using your origami paper! We love the feel of it, the ease of folding, and also the bright colours! Since we'd never before used origami paper, we weren't sure which brand would be best; but, your bright colours and high ratings on Amazon were what sold us on trying your brand first. We're glad we did!  :-)Thanks for doing such a great job producing this paper! My grandson and I have even used it to make ""accordion flowers"" for his mother (my daughter) from a pattern we found on Pinterest. The bright colours and ease of folding the paper helped make it a fun experience for us.  :-)",5
B00DUSKPUE,"As a middle school STEAM teacher I used these origami sheet for a project.My students had to make a structure by using at least 6 origami shapes.The goal of this project was to enhance their imagination, creativity, art work and development of origami skills.Now scientists and mathematicians are using the art of origami for nano designing and teaching calculus respectively.For me origami paper set was very useful.It was precisely cut which helped in making the structures precisely.Moreover the sheets are colored which had wonder affect on the work of my students.I will definitely go for more sheet sets in future.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"This paper feels a touch too thick for anything with many layers. Anything more complex than the more basic figures like the crane or the butterfly makes me feel like this paper will tear at the seams, so not a good choice if you plan on using this as practice origami for really complex folds. Right off the bat I can tell it would Not handle being the three-petal iris without tearing along that thickest petal aggravatingly. As I'm using this paper for 1000 cranes, however, thankfully it's thin enough to handle for that, though so far I've found I need to be a little more careful with folding the head and tail.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"I have used this origami paper for many years, however, this last order was lost due to the package was not sealed and the paper was lost ...I was still billed for the paper and have yet to receive the replacement.",2
B00DUSKPUE,"The packaging was very thin and flimsy. It is a wonder that the origami papers remained in tact and undamaged. All sides of the wrapping were torn and/or opened. This fragile, crafting product needs to be in a box.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"My granddaughter (10 yrs old) has Origami as part of an after-school program (in Lake Tahoe, CA).  Bought these for her.  She loved them.  Her mom said upon opening up the box, she went straight to her room and started folding things.  How refreshing to think that a 10 yr old has something else to occupy their time, other than the telephone or a video game on TV!  I'll gladly purchase more, when she tells me she needs them!  Excellent Purchase!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"This beautiful Origami set arrived on time, although I was on vacation so couldn't pick it up until I got back. Amazon alerted me to the fact it had reached my post office. The package was in perfect condition and none of the papers were squished or discolored. This is a Christmas gift for my son so the package has not been opened. Looking through the wrapper though, the colors are vibrant and beautifully hued. There is also included a link for 100 free designs that is immensely helper for the beginner.I would definitely recommend this product to someone wanting an entry level kit into Origami.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"I live in Rome, Italy and I ordered this for my great niece inthe States.  My sister Skyped me to say that the paper arrived and that it is just BEAUTIFUL!!!!!  Since it is for Christmas, I won't know of my niece's reaction until then, but given that her mom and she are very close, I know that if my sister says it is great, then it is!  I was amazed at the price, given that I do origmai myself. My sister said that the sheets are perfect for this artform, which she knows my niece already learned in art school and is addicted to. So, I would say, don't hesitate to order this!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Bought this product as a prelude to cutting snowflakes with my students.  The paper is a nice quality and folds and cuts easily.There are 20 different colors. The primary colors come in 2 or 3 different shades and hues (eg. green, light green)...except orange.It would be great if you would provide the same range of hues for orange as you did for the other colors and maybe eliminate white.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I gave my granddaughter different packets of folding papers.  She practiced with some plain paper then started folding with these.  She loved these and is ready for more.  I told her these were a gift not a life long supply. However, I do plan on getting her some more, cuz I love her.",4
B00DUSKPUE,This is really nice origami paper.  I like that it is colored on both sides so your project will look fine no matter which side you begin on.  It came quickly with the shipping and in excellent condition.  I also liked the wide variety of colors so I can make almost anything that I want and I have the colors that I want to use.  I appreciated the free e-book because this gave more ideas of projects that could be made with the paper.  I look forward to making more items using this origami paper.,4
B00DUSKPUE,"These are absurdly small. Comically small.My child was very disappointed when these arrived.To be fair, the description does say these are small. But come on, does anyone read the entire description? And the images are deceiving.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"This paper is affordable, comes in a nice assortment of colors, and certainly worked well for me for making beginner level origami projects.  The only thing that I would have liked is if some of the sheets were double sided (i.e. a different color on each side).  For a couple of the figures that I made, I used two sheets of paper so that I could have two different colors, but that made folding the figure much more difficult than it would have been with a single sheet.Other than that, the paper seemed just right to me.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. She loves the colors! She and my son have been watching videos from YouTube and using construction paper but this paper has made their hobby so much more enjoyable.A representative from the company followed up via email to make sure that the paper was delivered in a timely manner  The bonus patterns are in the form of an ebook and I haven't figured out how to have them available for her use on her parents' device, which is a major disappointment.  Because of this I can only give 4 stars.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"this is uncanny. i knew this paper was small going in, but its TEENY TINY. like even smaller than sticky notes, which is what I've been using. i can imagine itd be pretty funny if you didnt read the description. but they work well, they're easy to fold, and theres even some metallic silver and gold papers. they make some REALLY cute pieces.",5
B00DUSKPUE,Excellent.....,5
B00DUSKPUE,"The pack includes 20 colors as described (same color on both sides).  However, some color papers are heavier than the other ones.  It's not a huge difference but it's definitely noticeable when I hold them.  Also, not sure if I received a bad batch or what, but the papers are not in perfect square.  I have folded 4 things so far and none of the paper has perfect square, some worse than others.  On the bright side, double sided color helped conceal the imperfect final product (compare to fold with one side paper).Overall, I think it is still a pretty good deal for double sided paper.  If your origami design is simple and doesn't rely on perfect folding every step of the way, this is good for practicing.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"The paper itself is fine. However it it was delivered I opened my package to find the the paper was opened and loose, luckily for me it didn't fall all over the place.",3
B00DUSKPUE,"First off, the colors are great, I will say that.  Wide variety and very bright.  However, the quality of the paper itself could be better in terms of consistency.  Some are very thin, perfect for complicated folds, while others are so thick it's almost like folding card stock - it leaves a crease well enough but is impossible to fold on advanced designs.  In addition every few sheets isn't very square - so when you're trying a precision modular fold it comes out a bit off because when folded in half the corners don't meet perfectly.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"Thinner and lighter weight than proper origami paper, this craft grade paper is the same under saturated color on both sides.",2
B00DUSKPUE,"The different colors feel like they have different weights, they certainly fold differently, but there aren't any that feel TOO stiff or TOO flimsy. Overall it'd be nice to feel like all colors fold the same, but none of the colors are actually a bad weight for me personally so I'm satisfied with them.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"Having never dabbled in origami before, I was looking for the biggest bang for my buck, plus a product that is made here in the USA. When this arrived, I was immediately impressed with the quality, as well as the colors. 500 glorious sheets of bright, beautiful colors (although let's face it, brown and grey don't have much going for them!). I made close to 100 cranes in a three day period, so clearly I've become a bit obsessed. Even better, I'm an art teacher at a Boys and Girls club, and many of my students want to know how to make origami as well! I will be ordering another pack or two soon, since my kids are chomping at the bit to make their own cranes.",5
B00DUSKPUE,"I bought this for my best friend after finding out she is a paper folding genius. She reported back to me that the paper was of high quality and easy to fold AS WELL AS sturdy enough for her little ones to play with her folded cranes. She was excited about the possibility of learning new folds with the ebook, but she hadn't tried it as of today. Thank you for a great product!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Love the paper. The only little problem is that the measuring is not precise - example: when I fold a triangle, 1 of the sides always have a little extra and I have to cut it. Other than that, really good paper.",4
B00DUSKPUE,This paper doesn't tear easily.  It is good for a beginner.  The colors come in a wide variety as advertised.The e-book has some excellent as well as very difficult to follow directions; I don't recommend the e-book for beginners.  Going to youtube or other sites for folding directions is more helpful to a less advanced folder.,4
B00DUSKPUE,"I make senobes, a complex geometric shape. A challenge to fold one made with 2 inch paper but looks fantastic when finished.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I like the paper, but I'm a little sad. When the package arrived the paper was not wrapped in the plastic and some of it was kind of folded. I had to toss a few sheets. The paper works good for origami.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"My son made some origami shapes and designs in school and wanted to make some at home too. So I shopped around and found this economy pack from Origami Craze. It shipped super fast. Each sheet is strong, high quality, with brilliant vivid color, and easy to fold. Which is great because my little guy is tough on paper! The designs are fun to do and the Ebook is VERY easy to follow.We are having LOTS of FUN, and our little pieces of art are holding up well. I can see we will use this up fast enough, and the price is just right (and they gave me a coupon for 20% off my next order!) I will buy again. Thanks!",5
B00DUSKPUE,"Good paper.  It's just shy of 6"" square, but at least it's an even square (I read previous reviews that said it was uneven).  It's not exactly origami paper...I'd say like colored copy paper, but it serves its purpose for my kids and myself (beginners) to try our hand at origami.  Overall great value for the price.  I only docked a star bc it's not exactly 6"" nor is it really origami paper.",4
B00DUSKPUE,"I bought these for my wife who is working on a 1000 crane project. The paper is boldly colored on both sides, folds cleanly, and is slightly thicker compared to the cheaper papers that usually come with kits. Overall solid quality and satisfying color saturation. Can't really go wrong with this pack. Price is reasonable given the quality.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,Seems to be working well. We made a set of dominos and they came out beautiful.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"Absolutely love this stuff! All my projects came out perfectly!! So happy I choose this brand! Short time of curing, no bubbles, easy to combine and food safe!! Highly recommend for quick projects, durable products and high quality!",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"This stuff is an amazing buy and high quality.I make wooden rings. CA Glue can and does chip overtime and needs to be refinished.With this awesome stuff. I can mix tiny batches (using pipettes to measures the parts) and just brush it on and let it dry, then wet sand in between coats... and I tell ya. The end result is 100x better than the normal CA glue coating, and I know will last way longer...Great brand. 50/50 mix makes it super simple. For tiny batches. Just get the bulk pipettes and the bulk paint brushes.. It's also self leveling and dries quite fast. No noxious smells either.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,My first time doing a resin project and I can honestly this might be my new hobby  the directions were easy to follow I feel the drying time was lot quicker than 8 hours my project is definitely sturdy and I had some bubbles but I have learned to mix slower to avoid them but overall not a bad product it did what it was suppose to,4
B0CZDCWRDS,I needed to strengthen a serving tray so I gave it new strength with this epoxy cover. It worked very well. I'm pleased with the result and it accomplished the task at hand,5
B0CZDCWRDS,My 2nd time buying. My first time using epoxy I was very nervous. This product is easy to use (just following the instructions) I will continue buying this product.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"This was my first ever resin so I have no basis for comparison. Here's how it went....I found the gloves and sticks in this kit a pointless waste of money (if they even factored in to the the price). The gloves were too big and I got three sticks which wasn't even enough for my first pour. So I wouldn't buy this because it includes gloves/sticks, go get your own.The little cups were nice, but little. They hold enough for some jewelry maybe. If you're doing coasters or an art pour piece they didn't hold enough and I had to buy bigger ones. I'm also older and I found the markings on the cups hard to read. I wish they had been in black or such. The markings are in ml's.The resin itself was fine. Directions are easy, ratio is even so that was nice, stirring for a full three minutes. I've just finished this set so it's too early to tell if it will yellow or not.There was no bad odor, very little odor at all actually, but I did turn on the purifier and sat in front of an open window anyway.It has a 40 minute window to play around with it. I LOVED that. As this was my first experiment with resin, I went slowly at every stage, didn't have things handy I should of, etc. etc. I poured in the morning and left it and next morning all was dry.As I'm new to this, I took the back of a coaster mold and used the various small sections to experiment with colors and techniques, keeping notes on each experiment.So other than the gloves which didn't fit and too few sticks, I'd recommend this for beginners.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I bought this to embed 2 small jets into a guitar body. It's a project for a customer who is an ex-pilot. I first experimented with coins in a piece of maple. The clarity was superb, but I was greatly disappointed in the lack of hardness after more than 48 hours. The fingerprint in the upper right of the embedded penny was just made on August 17, although the penny was cast on June 28th. The jet that is shown in the unfinished guitar body had to be removed (with great difficulty) and a new one needed to be purchased, of course. It sure presents well, but it surely will not continue to look like that unless the guitar is put on a display stand, and not touched. I need a better product that has a higher Shore hardness number. I used straight sided MARKED measuring cups to mix 20mil of each part IN THE SAME CUP. I filled part A to the 20mil line, and then poured part B until it reached 40mil, and then I mixed completely as directed. There was zero chance of a mixture problem. The fact that after 2 months it shows a fingerprint does not bode well.",3
B0CZDCWRDS,The product itself is amazing. I've never had an issue with it setting or being unlevel.  However.....you'll need to buy your own measuring cups because they shove everything in a box that's only big enough for the jugs so the cups always come cracked and completely unusable.,4
B0CZDCWRDS,"Decent product over all.Hardens properly, comes out clear and not cloudy. Can't speak as to how well it ages, but I'm keeping my expectations reasonable.The only problem I have with it is just how many bubbles it gets, and how hard they are to get out without a pressure pot (which I do not have).The pumps are a handy feature, though.",4
B0CZDCWRDS,"Very nice resin, cures very clear.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"Product works well, love that it comes with a set of cups. With just this size bottles we made about 7 small jewelry boxes.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,The pumps did not distribute a large enough amount and with the pump air was added. If poured from bottle product was great.,4
B0CZDCWRDS,"Great product, worked perfectly.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I've purchased this multiple times,  I will never chose anything else so far. Less bubbles when mixing a little faster than you should Low smell, fast cure, perfect.  There was never leakage in my packaging,  everything came the cups sticks etc nothing is ever broken",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I have purchased several different brands of epoxy trying to find a good balance between cost and quality and I have to say this was a great buy so far.  There was a coupon so I received a small discount and thought I would give it a try.  I made several pen blanks with mica powders and gold flake; I also make a couple sets of D&D dice sets for a friend with the same powder and colored flakes.  They cure a lot faster than most of the other brands I have used.  Before I mixed the epoxy, I heated them up to 150degrees in a water bath with my sous vide.  I haven't used this stuff at room temp yet so I can't speak to that but once heated up it works great.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"It works well, just PLEASE make sure that you watch some guides on youtube BEFORE you use it! it is very easy to spill some and get some on your skin and it feels awful. Just make sure you have some rubbing alcohol nearby and it works very well to remove the very sticky residue. I also wish the packaging contained more cups and stirring sticks as well.",4
B0CZDCWRDS,As long as you match the ratio right it turns out great! Hardly any smell which is nice and dries fairly quickly.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,i use this resin for my jewelry making business and i love it!! does not turn yellow easy to work with because of the pumps. this is the only type of resin i use.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,It worked very well,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I have been using this product for a few months, and it has been very successful.  My last order, the resin bottle leaked and therefor everything had resin on it. Called CS and they sent a replacement ASAP. Great CS",5
B0CZDCWRDS,I did not have any problems with this resin. It was pretty much bubble free when stirred correctly and was odor free. The only thing is I wish it hae more than a 1/8 inch pour capable. I didn't realize that until I read their pamplet. Cures well,4
B0CZDCWRDS,"Very impressed with the amount of stuff you get with this kit and is a good value for your money, the problem was how the original shipper packed the box, the tall hard plastic measuring cups where crammed on top of the other products and at some point got crushed and broken. The company of origin needs a better packing system or bigger box, Amazon over packed the original box in another box so the damage didn't happen while being shipped to me.Over all its a great product and since the tall hard plastic cups are a consumable and the rest of the product was still in good shape saw no reason to send it back",4
B0CZDCWRDS,Worked very well for the project,5
B0CZDCWRDS,Works well for craft prodjects,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"So, granted I'm new at resin craft.....but really, the instructions that came with the product could be better.  It says mix equal parts....so being the precise person that I am, I got out a scale and mixed equal weights.  And ended up with lots of part A left over when part B was used up.  After way too much time on YouTube looking for the answer, I found that you have to mix equal volumes (NOT weights, the 2 fluids have different densities).  So the instructions COULD have told me ""Mix equal volumes.  If you prefer to measure using a scale, the ratio to be used is not 1:1 but 1.23:1.""  Public schools prepare most of us for ratios, my goodness, so it would have been great if that was spelled out.  Instead it spelled out that I should mix for several minutes, then pour into a different container and mix again, and then pour it into a 3rd container before using.....so if the manufacturer can go into that much detail about mixing, it could have also gone into enough detail about measuring.  Also, apparently the equal-parts resin products are good for shallow pours only, as they have a quick cure-time.  I learned on YouTube that the resins that are 2:1 are good for deep pours, as they have a longer cure-time which is needed for the depth to rid itself of bubbles better, it stays fluid longer which allows the bubbles to rise to the top and escape.  You can see in my picture, the skull with the screws (he is a ""screwed up guy"" :-), I did multiple shallow pours as I added screws and the bubbles are minimal at the top of the head (the mold is upside-down while in use).  But once I had all the screws in place I finished it off with about 2-3 inches of resin all at once....and you can see the bubbles that remained in place along the bottom of the skull.  So, again - some instructions would have been appreciated, ie ""to avoid too many bubbles, don't pour more than 1 inch without curing in between.""",4
B0CZDCWRDS,I didn't like the pumps.  The resin came out too slowly and too much work pumping.  I ended up just taking the pump off and pouring the resin.  Lots of micro bubbles.,4
B0CZDCWRDS,"I like this product, I'll probably buy it again, but they advertise that it doesn't turn yellow. It does. I've been keeping it inside the house with no direct sunlight (barely any sunlight enters the room and it's hidden beneath the table), and it turned yellowish.",4
B0CZDCWRDS,"I've bought this kit several times.  It's great epoxy.  Easy to mix and pour, flawless results every time.  Highly recommend.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I did a pour into a 2.5 inch cylinder of 40 ml.  It made a nice solid disc, but it is filled with tiny bubbles.",3
B0CZDCWRDS,Unfortunately I got this and it leaked all over everything! Product is amazing though!!,3
B0CZDCWRDS,"It works well enough, but the pumps are impossible to pull the liquid through, and the silver protective tabs do not come off completely, so it makes pouring messy.  Very bubbly.  I'm going back to my regular resin, I just tried this because of the price point.  I did like the disposable aprons that came with it.",3
B0CZDCWRDS,"I really like this epoxy and how affordable it is comparing to other brands with the same quality. The thing to mention is that for me it works better for larger pieces- it cures faster and hardens well. For smaller pieces, like earrings and pendants, especially if to add liquid colorant, it cures way longer and may stay flexible",5
B0CZDCWRDS,See above remark.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"The resin was not enough for making the heart, square, or rectangle mold. Do not buy this one or make sure to just buy like four extra resin bottles.",3
B0CZDCWRDS,"I was excited to try this brand. I got my package today, 9.22.24, and the cups are all broken. One of the pump handles is broken. One of the bottles is leaking inside the box. I couldn't even take everything out of the box because of the leak. It smells bad.With all that said, I got ahold of customer care and they made it right. I received a new package today, 9.24.24, and everything seems to be perfect! Now to create!! Thank you!",5
B0CZDCWRDS,It is a good product,4
B0CZDCWRDS,I got this because i got the other stuff needed off temu for cheap as hell. I was surprised to see how expensive the epoxy is though. Luckily I am only doing outlet and light switch covers for my daughters room so I do not need very much.,4
B0CZDCWRDS,"The first casting I did with the resin came out really good - small batch of 60mL. Getting the temperature for the water baths was a bit tricky but it worked. The second casting I made a batch that was 150mL. I mis-judged the rest time after I mixed up the batch.  But to my surprise, it set in my beaker. I am assuming I had gotten it too hot; too quick (and I was doing this in the winter but the room temp was at 70 F). I am going with small batches for pours, set up for your pour before pre-heating the resin so you eliminate it hardening on you too fast. It does come out very nice, though. I did allow it to cure in a room that was at 72 F.",4
B0CZDCWRDS,"This stuff is my least favorite epoxy I have used to date.  The stuff I do I need it to be perfectly clear with no bubbles so I am always degassing my epoxy before I pour.  This stuff will not degass very good at all, it is simply too thick.  I even heated the epoxy up so it would flow better and it still would not degass.  I put my mold filled with epoxy in my vacuum chamber hoping that it being thinner physically (less than 1/2 deep at the deepest part) that it would degass more effectively.  Nope, all it did was make a big bubbly mess.To be honest, every time I try to degass this stuff it starts to look like a bubble bath in my vacuum chamber.  Tons and tons of bubbles on top, but they wont combine or burst.  I have to let air back in, use a torch to pop the bubbles and then vacuum it again.  I have to repeat that 3 or 4 times, and even then I still see small bubbles in my pours.What I do like though, the pumps are great and 12 pumps of A is exactly the same as 12 pumps of B... so I could do this stuff without actually measuring.  I can just go by pumps, so at least that is nice.",2
B0CZDCWRDS,"So first casting did not go good at all the resin stayed rubber like even after 3 days. After further testing it just seem like this resin is extremely sensitive to additives and temperature. Do not use anything other then mica powder to color this resin imo. Also make damn sure the room temp stays 70-75f the full curing process even after de molding then make sure to leave sit the extra 48hrs after de molding. I honestly recommend you do one test run with nothing added and 100% clear just the resin to test how it cures.Bubble were not to bad at all make sure to not mix to fast no need to hurry the mixing process. Warm the resin in hot water for 3-5min before mixing. Then if your able you can blast it for a second or two with a heatgun, space heater, or hair dryer to help bring out the rest of the bubble.Clearness is very good no yellowing and casted nice and glass like clear. It will pick up any fine scratches or details that the silicone mold picked up off of the master. This is actually a very good thing and shows this resin has a very good flow and should grab every tiny detail of the mold.",4
B0CZDCWRDS,"I gifted this with a silicone kit as a birthday gift for a 14yo. He absolutely loves it and working with it. The molds are coming out clean and no bubbles. Mixes colors with it, no problem.  The ease of the pumps is all I hear about.  His mom(my sister from another mother) is happy as well. Clean up is a breeze and no spills with the pumps. I would definitely recommend this on their word and he will be getting this for every holiday.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"Needed epoxy for a quick prototype and what I had in stock was expired.Right off the bat, while determining the mass of this material, I find that their suggested volumes are substantially off, over 20% in the case of the hardener.Product listing states 10.54 Lbs for 104.8 Oz, which would mean 5.27 lb or 84.32 oz mass per container.Net weight would be the weight of the actual product, Gross would be the weight of the product including the container. Whether this is gross or net weight, the weight should at LEAST be that 5.27lb and It is not, in either case.This better be some amazing material or its going right back.",2
B0CZDCWRDS,"I tried multiple different resin  products.  And I will definitely buy this product over and over.  The only thing I didn't care for was the pumps. I thought I would like using the pumps, but I could do with without them.Thank you",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I'm a beginner so I'm still learning but instructions said you can remove resin from mold after 10 hours, don't do that!  It was still soft and turned to mush.  I'm going to redo it and let it sit for a few days, this is a patience hobby I'm finding out.  Looks to be a good product.  Stir slowly also and don' t rush the steps I think that's what causes small bubbles.",4
B0CZDCWRDS,"I love this resin for a lot of reasons. The main reasons is because the work time is so long, and the VOC's and the smell is minimal. When stirring, the bubbles are minimal, even when stirring vigorously. I find that it's self leveling, easy to work with, and I've used this resin for awhile. And I've tried a lot of resin products. Out of all of them, this is my favorite.I think I can work with it, adding my glitter, pigments, etc for about 30 mins or so before it starts to cure. Also it's inexpensive compared to a lot of resin brands out there. I think one brand I spent about $100 for less than a gallon!! And resin is expensive, there isn't anyway to get around that. But, this brand is inexpensive enough where you can get a starter pack for less than $25! I think it even includes a mold, findings, keychains, pigments, PPEs, measuring cups and so much more.Definite buy! Oh and you can use my code mdld_13 for 10% off if you spend $40 or more. But, I do not get any products for free - I pay for resin myself.Buy this resin!",5
B0CZDCWRDS,This resin is one of my favorites of the ones I've used because it gets hard while and it doesn't stick together after it's dried like a top on a box doesn't stick to the bottom and you aren't able to get it off it comes off with ease just like it's supposed to unlike other residents I've used the tops always stick,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"This is the best resin I have worked with thus far.  Had done a wonderful job on all of my crafting molds ad projects.  Will definitely purchase this again, and recommend it to others for their crafting as well.  Great buy!!!",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                              Producto funcional,un poco demorada la entrega",4
B0CZDCWRDS,I used it to make angels for Christmas,5
B0CZDCWRDS,this is the best ive used yet. perfect pour no need for heat.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"Made some really cool bookmarks, pendants, and small jewelry boxes.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,One of the jugs did leak in the box. I was able to wipe it all down but since it was a 2 part epoxy could have been a real mess if the both would have leaked,3
B0CZDCWRDS,"I love this resin! It's perfect for small projects. I got it to create a pressed flower phone case, and have also bought other molds on amazon for making key chains and coasters. I included pictures of my projects thus far. It's my first time working with epoxy resin and this kit is GREAT for beginners! It includes popsicle sticks, plastic measuring/mixing cups, and the resin.My ratio was definitely a little off for my first project of the phone case/key chains, but it seems to be quite forgiving because it still cured perfectly. I was worried it would remain sticky and not cure because I was off, but it still worked like a dream. Follow the instructions-- they are so helpful! I liked their tip of placing the cup in hot water before pouring, as the heat will get rid of any bubbles that remain and will make the texture much more liquidy and easier to pour. It's a very thick/viscous texture otherwise.As other reviewers mentioned, the resin will remain quite flexible even after curing about 6-8 hours. This is nice if you want to adjust or bend, but personally, I recommend you don't take your projects out of the molds for at least the full 24-48 hours if you don't want them to bend. After the full 24-48 hours it becomes rock hard and looks great! Cures quickly and looks super clear. Also works well with mica powder, which I experimented with in my coaster. Beautiful!My old complaint is that if you want to pour from the cups onto small projects (like a phone case), it's much easier to work with a measuring cup that has a point or lip, or isn't just completely cylindrical? It makes a mess.Remember, make sure you wear gloves, wear a mask, and work in a well-ventilated space (with a fan if possible too!)",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"Very satisfactory, thanks.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I am a new user to the hobby of making jewelry and other objects by using Epoxy Resins. I used this 2 part epoxy right away when it was delivered. I mixed up a batch of 100 ml, which is large enough to make a small pyramid, several geometric shapes and small molds of jewelry of various shapes. The mixture itself took about 4 minutes to stir and I could see that all the air bubbles were out and the mixture looked very clear in the silicone cup that I was using. I then split the mixture into 4 smaller cups so that I could add either a power color or a liquid ink color. After a little stirring I proceeded to fill the molds. This was all an experiment for me. I am learning about how to fill the molds and try colors out. I mixed some of the colors in some of the larger molds to see how they would blend or look next to each other. The epoxy mixture poured great. It flowed evenly to fill each mold. I had to learn to slow down as some of the smaller molds overflowed a it. When the pouring was done I had to let them solidify overnight. I looked at the molds the next day. Everything solidified within 12 hours, probably cause the molds were so small. Every item turned out great. The epoxy was great and easy to use. Clean up of the expos was easy because I used all silicon cups and a lot of disposable stir sticks and I was careful not to be messy. Using this epoxy Mx was great and I recommend it to all users, new and more experienced users.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,It worked as expected. I recomend the product.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,Absolutely love this expoxy..small amount goes a long way,5
B0CZDCWRDS,It was easy to use,4
B0CZDCWRDS,Like everything,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"The instructions were easy to follow, straight forward, no guess work. If you follow instructions. This will work. I used it to fill knot holes in wood and it came out perfect. Just remember to cover the back side of the knot hole.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,I made many coasters with this resin and all were great quality.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,This stuff works good!!! I'm a noob and using this resin for the first time was a wonderful experience! I did use a resin warmer to help the resin. I would 100% recommend it and will be back for more! If you have never used resin this stuff is wonderful. Thank you!,5
B0CZDCWRDS,I've tried out 8 different manufacturers for epoxy resin and this is hands down the best I've encountered so far. Really solid and very clear and mixed easily.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,Excellent product for the price!!,5
B0CZDCWRDS,It's ok. I am trying different brands to find the one I like the best. This one is average.,3
B0CZDCWRDS,I used it to pour a table and it didn't set/cure well. Very tacky/sticky. Soft places. Not impressed.,3
B0CZDCWRDS,I mixed according to the instructions 1:1 (10ml A : 10ml B) mixed for the 15 min poured into my mold and let it cure for 24h my pieces are so flexible and the resin is not hard soft enough to dent with fingernail.Edit: 2nd attempt full cylinder cast no dye result was better got most of the resin hard except for a small portion on the top lip of my cylinder which was soft. Many bubbles in my cast but it added to the aesthetic,4
B0CZDCWRDS,Our projects turned out nice. One kit coated this small board about 7-8 times and half of a large 2ft wide board with 3-4 different coats. Powders blended well into it.  Used outdoors on porch in 75F weather. Dried enough to move indoors after about an hour.  The thinner coated board hardened in about 2 days.  The smaller board still needs to harden and it's been a week. The reason is because there were too many layers put on at once.  Need to do a few thin layers or let first set of layers dry for a while before putting more on.  Not a problem if you don't need it set quick though as it will eventually cure,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"This is amazing stuff.  I used it to seal the top of a mosaic table top pictured.  It was if you covered it with a piece of glass.  This was my first time to use this type of epoxy and it was extremely simple to use.  The directions were extraordinary complete and left nothing to your imagination on how to proceed.  It can get messy if not deliberately careful.  It will flow through the smallest crack and levels itself.  Follow the directions.  I tried using a hair dryer to remove the tiny bubbles as suggested, but the wind was too strong and blew the epoxy off level.  It comes with a set of gloves, but I used my own latex gloves because one of the included gloves split open while putting it on.  You do not want to get it on your hands.  It is hard to remove.  That is the only adverse experience.  I will use it again and add color for future projects.  Follow the directions.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"In spite of my best efforts, this resin disappointed me. I've tried many different kinds, this brand had the most bubbles, and I had very poor results using it for that reason. I don't recommend this product, especially if you plan on giving your crafts as gifts.",2
B0CZDCWRDS,"I had bought a drinking horn for a costume and for use when I noticed that it was a natural horn and that it wasn't properly sealed. Additionally it had an air trap that even when drying it with the mouth of the horn up it would catch bacteria. You could smell it. The classic rotten egg smell. I really did like the horn and I didn't want to return it over something trivial that could be fixed easily so I got the crystal resin as a simple solution.So after cleaning out the horn again and drying it my self until it was moisture free and letting it sit on its side until it was bone dry I prepped for the resin coating and sealing.I followed instructions as they were easy to follow. Coated the inside of the horn and sealed the air trap with about 2oz. of the mix. Let it cure for 2 days and tadah! Drinking horn is now as smooth as a plastic cup, has no after taste and more importantly, no air trap catching unwanted bacteria.Of course, this means the horn now only holds 24oz instead of the original 26.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,"If you like gigantic air bubbles, embellishments that float and won't cover, layers that crack, soft spots in your projects and alcohol ink that turns into a glob of color, this is your epoxy resin!There is a lot of prep with this resin that are in the instructions received (but not on the website). Heat bottles so resin does not get soft spots, stir for 3-5 minutes (normal for all resins) and use a 4th cup and stir more so the resin does not get cloudy.  Epoxy resin is tough enough without all the extra steps.  This resin also seems extra sticky.  I followed the directions to the letter.  I ruined so many projects, wasted so much time.  I tried to use a lot of sealed photographs in coasters and the giant air bubbles that form on the underside are ridiculous! I am going back to my old epoxy.  I tried this because it was cheaper, guess you get what you pay for.",2
B0CZDCWRDS,I used this product and followed the directions to a T. No matter how slow I mixed the epoxy the air bubbles were still there. I found a video from the manufacturer where the guys said to let the epoxy sit for 15-20 min before using it. Letting it sit and using a heat gun did help a lot. All of my tumblers have come out beautifully. Decided to try another brand of epoxy because this epoxy just seemed very thick to me. After using other brands I have confirmed that this epoxy is very thick and takes longer to dry compared to other brands such as Amazing clear cast. It does what you need it to do however I would never pour this into a mold (tried) due to the amount of air bubbles that remained in it.,3
B0CZDCWRDS,"I used the original Puduo  resin (not 3x yellow protection), and I really liked it.  So when I saw this version w/the yellow protection I thought...even better.  It wasn't better.  I made 10 coaster-sized items, and all but one had air bubbles.  I was placing an object into the resin before it was cured.  Air bubbles formed underneath the object.  I tried pouring one layer waiting about 6 hours then placing my object on the  nearly cured resin.  Again, air bubbles got trapped under the object.  I tried sanding, coating and sanding and coating the object, but air bubbles were trapped under the object.  I was going to send it back after using about half of the resin but continued to struggle with it.  Now the bottles are empty, and I only have one perfectly cured item to show for it.  I spent an hour hovering over each piece popping air bubbles as they emerged from the bottom of the pour and from underneath my object but that didn't help fix the air bubble problem.  I applied pressure to the top of my objects in an effort to release the bubbles from underneath the object, but that didn't work either.  Going to go back to the original Puduo.  I believe the anti-yellowing is actually a catalyst for the formation of bubbles.",3
B0CZDCWRDS,It is indeed crystal clear. No issues with using this to encase some stuff.,5
B0CZDCWRDS,Exactly what I needed,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I have had my eye on this for awhile, wishing to try my hand at resin crafts. The epoxy is surprisingly good, the kit contains the materials you need to mix, easy to read instructions, all that good stuff.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow. My cup came out cute,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"Bought this as a beginner just for fun, and it was great! Easy to use and came with all the supplies.",5
B0CZDCWRDS,Easy to use,5
B0CZDCWRDS,"I have made over 300 pieces of artwork doing a pour-over finish of epoxy resin and this is my first time using this brand of epoxy resin -  and the experience was night and day compared to the product that I have been using (which WAS Famowood Glaze-Coat).First of all, this mixed up quite well with relatively minimal bubbles - although I used a vacuum chamber to remove most of them that came with stirring.  There is very little odor, and much less so when compared to the product that I was using - and this is quite welcome!  The viscosity is perfect, as it flows well, it self levels, and it has enough hold that the surface tension keeps if from flowing over the side of the pieces that I work with.  Drying time is better than previous products that I have used - with it being dry enough to handle within 8 hours, and cured hard enough to drill out the center hole within 24 hours.I am not sure how it works with casting, but what remained in the cup (about 1/2"" deep x 1.5"" diameter) is rock solid and crystal clear- so I have no doubt that it will work great for that application.I am so very pleased that I chose PUDUO Brand of epoxy resin :-)",5
B01ETS3HGC,Nuova has been my go to brand for quality laminating pouches. I rarely get failed seal. Price has gone up a little in recent years but still a good value.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"I always wait until these are around $16ish for maximum savings. One summer I purchased different brands of laminating sheets and tried them out. This was by far the best. They hold up well and for me, the things I have laminated are still holding up after 3 years. I will continue to always buy this brand.",5
B01ETS3HGC,Works great for my needs- no more re-laminating!,5
B01ETS3HGC,"I am constantly making materials, including adapted books for my special needs classroom.  I keep a supply of this brand of laminating film on hand at home so I always have it ready. It's thicker than what is on the machine at work (that's frequently broken and I have no planning  period or duty free lunch time to use anyway). Since I end up paying for it out of pocket, this brand is one I've found after buying several different ones, that's fairly priced and last, even with some of my students who are rougher with materials.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"The only laminating pouches I purchase, and they've been my number one supply all year. The quality is consistently excellent, providing a clear, professional finish every time. They are easy to use and always deliver reliable results, making my documents look polished and durable. Whether for work projects or personal use, these pouches have never let me down. Highly recommend to anyone in need of high-quality laminating supplies!",5
B01ETS3HGC,"These laminating pouches are a great value for what you get.  This pack was about half the price for double the number of pouches.  I'm loyal to another brand and decided to try these when they were on sale.  I was pleasantly surprised by their quality.  They are slightly thinner than the competitor, BUT when you don't need extreme durability, these are a much better value.  I laminate many things that my students use, but we aren't hard on them.  These sheets worked great.",4
B01ETS3HGC,"While at first I thought I liked Best Laminating Pouches (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071HFDCD4/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_1?smid=A3DDEVBY0MMX5J&psc=1) better than this product, after reviewing some past laminating projects, this product is FANTASTIC. It's cheaper and I have not had a single bubble in my laminating yet. I do both ""cut then laminate"" and ""laminate then cut"" projects for use at home.I look for a few things in laminating pouches:1. Ability to ""laminate then cut"" - these are great! There is no peeling off of the lamination at all. I had to return the Amazon Basics laminating sheets due to peeling. They were horrible, these are great.2. Thickness - not all 3mil pouches are created equal. I do find Scotch brand to be the thickest with Nuova and Best Laminating Pouches a little thinner. The Nuova feels slightly thinner than Best Laminating Pouches, but not much (only noticeable in a side-by-side comparison and you are specifically looking for it).3. Durability - I get a lot of use out of my projects with my little ones. These have held up great. However, I must pull the sheet from my lamination machine (Scotch) once it's passed through or the end of the sheet left too close to the heating element will start to warp. I have not had this issue with other brands.4. Quality of seal - The seal on these is comparable to, or better than, the Scotch brand sheets. In all of my projects I have had very little space next to my paper that isn't sealed. Other brands (including Scotch) have left a significant space unsealed next to the paper. I like to be able to cut as close as I can, while still keeping the seal, and these sheets have excelled in that manner.I completely recommend this product and will definitely buy again. The two ""cons"" I have noticed is that it's a bit harder to keep these going straight through my machine than the other brands I have used (the sheets seem to slide to one side), and I can't leave the sheet in the laminator as the heating element warps the part left in. While they are a bit annoying, they are not deal-breakers for me.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I am a special ed teacher who laminates a lot of materials. I find I have better adhesion and less separation issues with this brand compared to name brand. They are a bit more firm than Am. Basics though both are supposed to be 3mm. Am Basics may erase better if you intend to use dry erase markers.These are usually the best deal price wise, so I use these more than the big name brand and Basics. I will go with Basics when the price is lower than Nuova.",5
B01ETS3HGC,These arrived and work well,4
B01ETS3HGC,Use them all the time for classroom activities,5
B01ETS3HGC,I have ordered these on numerous occasions.  They seal well and are a great thickness when heated.  They are the only ones I buy.,5
B01ETS3HGC,These are thinner than any other 3mm I've tried. They did work well.,4
B01ETS3HGC,Use these for business and homeschooling projects. Love them. Easy to use and fantastic quality. Always promptly shipped and in good condition.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"The price for this pack is amazing, it's the reason why I bought it. Goes through my laminator quite easily. It does not adhere well to glitter or metallic cardstocks. Very happy with these pouches, will buy again.",5
B01ETS3HGC,As someone who's had to laminate activities for children these are great and durable. If the activities I laminated with these survived kindergartners they can endure anything.,5
B01ETS3HGC,I buy this often it is a great value,5
B01ETS3HGC,Works just as you need it to,5
B01ETS3HGC,Great product!! So much cheaper in cost than the others and works just as well.,5
B01ETS3HGC,I use these for laminating my teacher things! Best brand and cheaper than most but good quality!,5
B01ETS3HGC,I am a Preschool Teacher and I use lamination A LOT. I found these pouches and they have been my go to recently. I love that it comes in a big pack and that they are easy to use and separate. I used them for this worm graphing activity. They got a lot of dirt on the but I was able to wipe them off when they were all done so we can keep using the graphs in the future.,5
B01ETS3HGC,I usually buy scotch because of the thickness and brand. Lately scotch has raised their prices and been really thin and I bought their product already 15 times. I was tired of wasting money because I use these for my business everyday. I would definitely buy this brand instead you will definitely save money. I will buy this again and again. I wish they had more than 200 sheets with a cheaper bundle. That would be awesome.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"This is just an amazing product!  I am just impressed with the quality of it!  And now I don't have to spend $2.79 on each laminating page at FedEx!  I can just do them from the comfort of my own home!  I made my own UberEats decals on my printer at home, and other laminating projects that I used to do at FedEx.  I remember I did not like having to pay so much for each and every laminating page.  But I just felt that if I had to pay, then I would have to pay.  But now I am in the ""do it yourself"" mode.  And I discovered that so many projects CAN be done.  If you get an inexpensive laminating machine, and then these laminating sheets, all is well.  Save money!  Do it yourself with these laminating sheets!",5
B01ETS3HGC,"My wife is a preschool teacher, so she is always laminating things. She was running low, so as usual, I shop around for the cheapest price. She wanted the 3 mil size laminating material, and this was the cheapest I could find. I actually got the super size box so she would not run out, because since it is getting close to the holidays, she will be laminating a ton.  Plus, just like any teacher, she has to pay for a lot of stuff. When she started using this, she said there is absolutely no difference from this then the expensive stuff.  Very happy that I got her this, and as you can see, there is a ton of laminating pouches! Got this one saved, and will certainly buy this again, which I'm sure will be sooner than later.  Win for me, win for the students!",5
B01ETS3HGC,"We found a kitten 6 months ago. We made a few signs to put up, to see if somebody was missing their kitten. This particular sign started out bright yellow. If you look closely, you can see some minor water damage from where the nails were (asking with rust from those nails. After 6 months outside, this sheet is still very pliable and is in very good shape considering water that seeped through because of the nail holes.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I'll start by saying that I would order these again - this price cannot be beat. As a new kindergarten teacher, I am laminating a lot of things - pretty much anything that kids touch needs to be laminated if I want it to last more than a day. At this price, it isn't too expensive to make sure that every center or game piece gets laminated. I also like that, like most personal laminating machine sheets, these come out thicker and sturdier than the big laminators at school.However, I did notice on my last batch of laminating that not all edges were sealed closely, so piece that were too close together may not have a sealed edge between them or one piece may need more edge than usual to make sure that the edge is sealed. Despite this, I will still purchase these again and just make sure to allow for some extra space for more effective edges.",4
B01ETS3HGC,"I was afraid to buy non brand sheets but it has worked very well. It has not messed up my machine and seems identical to the name brand. The quality is great for the price, this should last me awhile.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I ordered these to use once my Scotch brand pouches were used up. They are a tad thinner than the Scotch brand, so the finished pages aren't as sturdy/rigid. It's fine though, because as a home schooling family we don't need to be too tough.  I used a few so far to laminate parts of speech posters. They keep going a little crooked into the laminator, but didn't have any jams. I was able to laminate 3 layers of craft paper without an issue.  I think because it is thinner. :)",4
B01ETS3HGC,Don't buy any cheaper laminating pockets - spend the money on these. I recently tried another brand and had to come back to these. The other sheets were peeling off of everything I had laminated. Lesson learned. These ore the best.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"I am a teacher who uses a lot of lamination sheets. I have always used the name brand but decided to use these to save money. The scotch brand are a bit thicker, but thee are not that much thinner. I was still able to laminate two sheets at a time with no issues. Seems like these will hold up well with small group work that will be used over and over again my small children. Will try to update.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I cannot speak to how well these hold up as this is my first time using them. We're homeschoolers, so we go through A LOT of laminating pages and the price was right for 200. I laminated 21 pages tonight. They are all different sized things some flash cards, some tiny labels, and some full page things. These are much thinner then the red packaged name brand. They came out of the laminator a bit wavy and with more air bubbles between the cards.  Flash cards scoot around more in these when going through the laminator, so no squeezing them to save space, and you must be slow and gentle. I cut a set of card apart just to see how the edges held up and they seem nicely sealed. We'll see in time how durable they are.",4
B01ETS3HGC,I got this massive pack of laminating sheets because I am student teaching. Students can get really gross ( especially the little ones that I have) and these do the trick at keeping things lasting for a really long time. These are great at doing what they need to do. I have a scotch laminate machine and I use the 3 MM seeking. I only have to run it through one time and it works beautifully. No wrinkles either!,5
B01ETS3HGC,Absolutely no issues with these. Works perfectly,5
B01ETS3HGC,"Would recommend for general laminate.  My wife teaches and does a lot of laminating.  The Scotch ones that we have used in the past are labeled as the same mil thickness.  These seem thinner, but they work well.  Will continue to buy since the cost difference is significant.",4
B01ETS3HGC,"For the price, these are pretty good! I use laminating pouches to preserve my activities that I use with preschoolers. I like that I can clean them too if a kid sneezes or touches it after they had their fingers in their mouth.What I like:-worked with my Amazon Basics Lamintor-it came in two 100 wrapped packs, which was nice for storage-did the job! It laminated my stuff!-great valueWhat I didn't like:-about 30% of the pouches had a cut/scratch on them (not made by me) and required me to set them aside and use them with single-sided projects-I did have a few bubbles appear on my items after laminating them, but it wasn't an overwhelming amount (and was minor bubbling)Overall:-I still think these are a great value, but its important to point out the pros and cons. The cons are both minor, so I would recommend these pouches for anyone who needs thin pouches to add some protection to your project.",4
B01ETS3HGC,"When I first opened them I was kinda irritated because they were very thin and didnt look as thick, sturdy and nice as the name brand. They looked cheap. But after putting them to good use and laminating lots..they work just as good as name brand! No trouble with anything! Will purchase again!",4
B01ETS3HGC,"These sheets works perfectly fine with my name-brand laminator, I have had no issues with wrinkles or bubbles.As long as you're laminating a full sheet of paper, they work great.If you're trying to laminate smaller pieces (I'm a teacher, so this is frequent-things like flash cards and cards for small groups to use), the pouches dont have any ""hold"" between the sheets like the name brand pouches do (where the sheets kind of stick together to hold everything in place), so I have to try to find something to place under the pouch in order to load them in the laminator, and even then the pieces will shift as the pouch makes its way through.In most cases, this can be solved by just laminating before cutting, but there are some materials I want laminated so there's that border in order to preserve the materials a little longer. (3rd graders can be tough on things, no matter how hard you try!)",4
B01ETS3HGC,One side is already sealed so its easy to feed in your laminator . The sheets are very smooth and also very  slippery so i have to hold the sheets with my paper until it feeds in the laminator so it doesn't slide or fall out. so that was the only reason i removed a star. I can only compare to the laminating sheets that i bought first when i got my laminator over 4 ? years ago so im not sure if this is how the sheets are now or if its just this brand. I am laminating a lit more now that i'm home due to covid19. so I will try a different brand after this and update if necessary.,4
B01ETS3HGC,"This is Nuova Premium thermal laminating pouches. They measure 9"" x 11.5""/Letter Size/3 mil. There are 200 in the Pack (LP200H). These pouches work great. We've purchased these everal times. Durable and an excellent deal.",5
B01ETS3HGC,I've been using this brand since I started printing homeschool material in 2020. I've purchased OVER 50 packs of this brand. Always thought it was fantastic for the price. I had gotten a few really good deals on the Scotch brand so I switched temporarily. I finally ran out and needed more sheets. This brand is NOT what it used to be. The sheets are SO thin now. I will stick with the Scotch brand from here on out.,2
B01ETS3HGC,"I just finished a 200-pack of the name brand laminating pouches that I purchased last year. (I'm a teacher.) As a result, I can tell you unequivocally that these are DEFINITELY thinner than the name brand.However, they are much, much easier to get open and seem to have a lot less static than the name brand pouches. This may have something to do with how I stored the last set or something else unrelated to the pouches themselves, but I thought I'd mention it, just in case.I usually use off brands, and I'm perfectly happy with these for the price difference. They still laminate and protect my materials.",4
B01ETS3HGC,I use for laminating office and personal items. Product is sturdy and has professional appearance.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"These pouches worked perfectly for me!  I have used about 60 pouches and all have come out clear with no bubbles or warping.  I do not see any difference between these and the Scotch brand that came with my laminator (except being much less expensive than the Scotch).  If they had gotten mixed together I would have no way to tell them apart, before or after the lamination.  I use these for school activities, and the thickness is perfect for what I am doing.  They are thick enough that a regular sized piece of paper stays upright when you hold it up from the bottom.  It doesn't roll or bend.  Very pleased with the product and the price.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I bought these to laminate items for my classroom. As a first year teacher, I am laminating a LOT right now! Even though I was nervous to buy these, they ended up being wonderful! I would highly recommend, and they work wonderfully with my Scotch laminator. Only one sheet of lamination out of the pack of 200 had a scratch. They are not as durable as the Scotch brand, but they still work! I just purchased my second pack! :)",4
B01ETS3HGC,"I usually buy the Scott brand, but this one work even better I will buy again",5
B01ETS3HGC,These are great laminating pouches.,5
B01ETS3HGC,I'm a kinder teacher and like to print and laminate often. These are great quality and so affordable! Never had an issue using with my Scotch laminator. I purchase 2-3 times a year and I highly recommend if you're looking for quality laminating sheets.,5
B01ETS3HGC,As an RBT I use these almost daily for so many things. Always comes out crystal clear and keeps things durable for very long periods of time.,5
B01ETS3HGC,These work just as well as the expensive name brands.  Great product.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"These are very big and easy to use. Paired with a good laminator printer and these can be used for anything such as personal and business-wise. They are also thin so once you laminate something and cut it, they won't come apart.",5
B01ETS3HGC,Lo utilizo mucho para mis materiales de la sala de clase,5
B01ETS3HGC,My school Teacher friend loves them,5
B01ETS3HGC,"I use these for activities I make for my primary classroom. They are easy to use, last for multiple uses, and are a great price! I often end up buying these laminating pouches because they are the cheapest option for 3 mil sheets. If I'm laminating things smaller than the size of the pouch, I always cut first, laminate, and cut again so that each piece has a laminated border around it. They will last much longer this way. Great product!",5
B01ETS3HGC,Best laminate sheets they are so easy to use you just open the sheet place your creative art work close it and place it onto the laminate machine and done,5
B01ETS3HGC,"Money well spent.  I was skeptical about the quality because of the price but since what I do with them is not critical I decided to give them a try.  They are superior to the previous ones I bought for a much higher price.  I have a problem opening the pouches to put the paper in because of very dry skin.  These opened easily and immediately, and because of less static cling it is easier to position the paper quickly.  I have just finished using about 50 of them with no problems except for one that wrinkled but was operator error.  I accidentally put it in askew.  I highly recommend  these if all you need is 3 mil.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"You can tell the difference right away when you hold a scotch laminate sheet and a nuova laminate sheet. Nuova is thinner and a bit stickier to open. The film crinkles easily when struggling to open the sheets.HOWEVER>>>  They laminate great in any personal laminator and it seals clear. I will definitely buy these again because I usually have to cut up what ever I laminate and for a classroom that laminate practically anything, the price for quality is worth it.",4
B01ETS3HGC,I absolutely love these laminating sheets.I use them for everything. I believe this is the 6 time of purchasing.The price is great too!,5
B01ETS3HGC,"I have been trying various brands of laminating pouches since Amazon Basics laminating pouches were back ordered. I decided to take a chance on these due to the cheap price. They are not horrible by any means and once laminated they look and feel fine and comparable to  AmazonBasics Thermal Laminating Pouches - 8.9-Inch x 11.4-Inch, Pack of 100        and  Crystal Clear 200-Pieces Universal Thermal Laminating Pouches        . However, actually using them was frustrating. I am a kindergarten teacher and I create a LOT of centers for my kiddos and I laminate them for extra durability (why waste time making something if it won't last!). I am always laminating a lot of stuff and I like to be quick- well these sheets stick together and are hard to open to insert paper and if you don't open them slowly, they get creases that show even after laminating. I found if you run the item through again it might get the crease out but that is too time consuming for what I need. I suggest if you are a teacher or just laminate constantly to choose Amazon Basics or  Crystal Clear. If you are the occasional laminator then these are a fine choice.",3
B01ETS3HGC,These were a great deal ordered. They do the job and worked out great for my college stuff to keep it safe. Thank you fast shipping.,5
B01ETS3HGC,I bought these to laminate pages for homeschooling centers for my kid. I was a bit hesitant because of the reviews that they were not going to work but they were a great price. I had zero issues laminating the sheets. Most of the sheets i did were full sheets but i did have some cut pieces and everything turned out great without and bubbles.,5
B01ETS3HGC,These are just as high quality as the scotch brand but at a more affordable price. I use a ton of these as a teacher saving my curriculum- these are awesome!,5
B01ETS3HGC,Loved it all!,5
B01ETS3HGC,"I laminated multiplication charts for my students and these laminating sheets worked great! At first, I was a little reluctant because of the low price and some of the reviews but after using them, I became a fan. If I may offer a tip: when you feed the sheet into the laminator, do it feeding it with the sealed edge first and lift the tail end high on your fingers, as if they were rollers. This will prevent it from wrinkling.",5
B01ETS3HGC,Great paper for laminating. It went well on the first try. Even tho the edge folded might have been my own fault. Gotta try it again.But everything came out smooth and nice.Great quality ill buy more soon.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"So my usual brand of laminating pouches were out of stock and I really needed some. This brand popped up so I decided to try them. I use a lot of pouches and this was a packet of 200 for $14.99. Excellent price. And the product is really good. Its got a glossy sheen to it and it seems to be pretty thick and sturdy. So I went online to purchase some more and lo and behold they are not available now and they don't know if they will be available again. But they do have a 100 pack for about $11.00. Not a bargain to me. The other brand I used, Apache, was 100 for $8.95 but the same message comes up on those now too.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I'm a high school teacher, so I take my supplies very seriously. These lamination pouches are the best! They work with my Scotch-brand laminator and are a much better value than the name brand pouches. They seal easily; I rarely have to do a 2nd pass through even after cutting out shapes, and when I do have to do a 2nd pass, it's because I didn't let my laminator warm up first. Totally happy with them and the only laminator pouches I will purchase.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"I wanted so badly for these laminating pages to be just as good as AmazonBasics or Scotch. I read lots of reviews before I decided that the good seemed to outweigh the bad. Unfortunately, I found that these sheets are much thinner and not as sturdy as AmazonBasics or Scotch brand laminating pouches.  I also found that if I'm laminating multiple precut items in one page, that I have to hold the entire sheet together while it feeds through. When using similar products, the lamination stuck together and I didn't have to fold each page while waiting for it to finish. As a teacher, I don't know if these will hold up very long once my kiddos start using the Math Centers I've laminated. I would not buy these again. I'm sad I have 200 pouches that I don't want to waste, but am not super thrilled about.",3
B01ETS3HGC,"I've used these to raise the quality of pictures printed out on cardstock. They look dark when printed, but as soon as I slap them through the laminator with these sheets the images brighten up significantly.The laminate also gives a washable surface for markers, so I've been printing reusable ""fill in the blank"" worksheets and flash cards to teach my kid the basics of math and spelling once she's old enough.",5
B01ETS3HGC,"Here are the specifics of why I repurchased this item.  I REALLY like the guage of the laminate (very strong and sturdy). Be sure however, to round the edges of anything you might be cutting, otherwise the edges can hurt tiny hands.  I am an elementary school teacher and, like a lot of other people, I have my own laminating machine for smaller jobs up to menu size items.  These work VERY NICELY with my laminator.  I cannot compare them to any others, because I have not used any other brand.  I highly recommend these but, like any other ""off brand"" items, I would just verify that they will be compatible with your laminator.",5
B01ETS3HGC,Comes with a lot of sheets and worked well with my laminator.,5
B01ETS3HGC,"Ease of use, adhesiness",5
B01ETS3HGC,"So I paid for another brand at a office store, supposed to be premier, it was $30 for 150 of them. When I saw the ratings on this product I wanted to try it, and was happy to see the cost. Arrived today and used it right away, it is far better than the more expensive brand, better value in total. Buy this it is worth it!",5
B01ETS3HGC,I love these laminating sheets. I work as a child therapist and need to make stimuli allllll the time! These work great and they are sturdy!,5
B0C2HTXP49,"My daughter used this to glue Girl Scout badges onto her vest and had great results! It dried quickly and bonded well. We liked that the glue was thick enough to not run, but thin enough to spread well. Very easy to use.",5
B0C2HTXP49,"This fabric glue works great! It dries quickly and holds strong, even after washing. Perfect for quick fixes or crafting projects. Highly recommend for anyone in need of a reliable no-sew solution!",5
B0C2HTXP49,"This product is effective, however, it leaves a shiny dark stiff effect on the fabric",4
B0C2HTXP49,"I bought this to mend my son's favorite jeans, it worked like a charm. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5
B0C2HTXP49,"What do you do when a belt loop tears out of a perfectly serviceable pair old Levis? Can't sew it because the material tore out. I looked on Amazon, found some glue specifically built for the problem and ordered it. The video shows that I could just put the glue where I needed it, hold it for a minute or two, and magically it was the tear was fixed. The tube I got, though, said to hold firmly for 12 hours or something. So I saturated the sewn portion of the belt loop and put a little cloth patch behind the waist band and clipped it with a clothes pin. The next day, I wore the jeans..... perfect! The next day I washed the jeans..... still perfect! Right now I am satisfied with the glue. Cheap fix!!",5
B0C2HTXP49,"It does an ok job. After the glue dries it holds, but it takes a good about of glue. If it's not a flat surface, then it doesn't hold as well. And I don't recommend wahing whatever you use it on.  I did a test wash and the glues pieces started to come apart.",3
B0C2HTXP49,"I purchased this product to repair couple items, what a nice surprise, how great this glue works, easy to use, dries fast, flexible once dried, durable, highly recommend",5
B0C2HTXP49,"So far, I am pleased with this item. It is easy to use. I especially like how the tube is designed with a long pin that goes back into the narrow tube opening. We will see how it does after washing.",5
B0C2HTXP49,"Worked, strong hold",5
B0C2HTXP49,1,5
B0C2HTXP49,This is a good item if you can get the fabric to line up good enough it does work it does hold give it time to dry and make sure you get a good connection between the fabric that's torn overlapping it,4
B0C2HTXP49,"Over a number of months, hubby tore a multi-directional gash in the knee of his jeans. Basically went seam to seam. This stuff worked great to help me mend the tear.I cut a patch (from thrift store kid jeans) to attach to the inside of his jeans and used the glue to set it. IMPORTANT: I let glued patch sit under a stack of heavy books for 48 hours. It held like a champ.I then went back manually with a needle and thread to further secure the patch, as he's very hard on his jeans. The result is shown in the posted pic.I then repaired the seats of 4 more pairs of jeans using the same method. Have washed them all many, many times over.Yes, it has a strong rubber cement type odor, just run a fan or be near an open window. It subsides quickly.Just used it to reattach the trim on an area rug. I love this stuff. Highly recommend. Just follow the directions on setting the glue.",5
B0C2HTXP49,Use of the fabric glue is a terrific substitute for sewing.  I have been using it for years and creates a very durable seam.,4
B0C2HTXP49,"will wear off eventually on high use things like corners of a patch but  overall works very well on most fabrics. you only need a small amount, this is a large tube that will last awhile. patches on sweatshirts i reapply to the corners after 2 years... i'm happy with the product",5
B0C2HTXP49,so far great stuff !! and it has been lasting !!!,4
B0C2HTXP49,This stuff holds and dries quickly. Repaired shirt quickly but. No smell,5
B0C2HTXP49,Good glue for fabric!  Better to use this instead of a sewing machine to hem your pants and or skirts!,5
B0C2HTXP49,"Awesome fabric glue, best hold is if you leave it for 48-72 hours.",5
B0C2HTXP49,My son has some lettering on a sweatshirt that was falling off and we grabbed this- it worked! He said his shirt is now as good as new,5
B0C2HTXP49,"Dash cam installers pulled some of the headliner off during installation. Said it was the deterioration of the foam under the fabric liner and not their fault. After some research on Amazon reviews, I decided between double sided fabric tape and Naymaer fabric glue. I was a little wary of using a liquid glue thinking it would bleed through the fabric. Tried the fabric tape first and there was no way to peel off the backing without ripping some of the headliner foam with the tape, so that was a no go. So before attempting to fix the headliner with the Naymaer fabric glue, I first tried it on my sneaker insoles that were peeling off at the heel. That repair was super easy so I bit the bullet and attempted a fix of the headliner. Very easy application with the little spatula that comes with the tube of glue and, most importantly, no bleed-through the fabric liner. Repair is not noticeable from the inside of the car. Good enough for a 8 year old car. See photos.",5
B0C2HTXP49,"I recommend the manufacturer of Nayrmaer Glue employ a fluent English speaker in charge of writing the Description, Instructions, Warnings, etc. on the box. The confusing information could be dangerous to some people.That being said, I'm very pleased with the product itself. The packaging arrived intact, no dents or damage to the product box, no leaks whatsoever, and the pin in the opening of the tube is a bonus, IMO. It will prevent wasted glue in the future.I had a hole in a corduroy apron that I repaired with a different fabric glue. It didn't work as well as I expected.  I scratched off the old glue as much as possible, applied Nayrmaer Glue and after about 15 minutes, I can't even slip my finger nails in to pull it apart.I wanted to add that I'm pleasantly surprised that the seller, GliaronUS, took initiative in reaching out to me to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase and offered to make things right if I was not. Excellent customer service!",5
B0C2HTXP49,"I wanted to use this glue to patch up small holes in a wool sweater, bonding the opposing edges together. I had difficulties using this glue from minute one. I did not find it easy to work with and found it difficult to control the amount of glue gushing out of the tube, so inevitably, more glue spilled out onto the fabric. While the glue is very effective in creating a bond between edges, it dries to a very glossy shine, almost silvery. It is not translucent. Unless you can weave over this glossy residue, it significantly detracts from the repair job. Moreover, if you are unlucky enough that tiny amounts of glue splatter on the fabric, the splats dry to a shimmering gloss; I cannot recommend this for any use requiring bonding two edges.",2
B0C2HTXP49,"I didn't think it would work, but hemming up those pants that was great. The glue is stuck to my hamming project for at least six washes so far.",4
B0C2HTXP49,Easy to use and no mess! It holds well. Wait 48 hours to let the pieces completely dry.,4
B0C2HTXP49,Used it to glue a couple different hat bands on cowboy hats.  Worked great and I love the fine tip for getting behind the hat bands.,5
B0C2HTXP49,To mend tear.,4
B0C2HTXP49,"Immediately liked the tiny pin hole opening with anti clogging pin that inserts in the tip when opening and sealing. This enables you to get a very fine line of glue to seal your seam, hem, etc. It's quick drying, sure binding and works! I've used on a gore tex rain jacket where an under arm vent seam zipper had separated from the fabric. I applied two measures of glue within 48 hours and the seam is as tight as new. I've not laundered the garment, but this type of jacket isn't washed often. This product effectively restored a $160 rain jacket.",5
B0C2HTXP49,Works great !!! Used to put my sequins back on my dress,5
B0C2HTXP49,"ok, very good",4
B0C2HTXP49,"Got the perfect vintage handbag for an upcoming wedding! Matches my dress. Unfortunately, the glue holding the handles it was old and dry. Bought this, used a toothpick to slide the right amount of glue into the space, slid the handle in and calmed with an office binder clip to hold til dry. I *pulled* on that handle once it was dry and was not able to pull it loose! Worked like a charm even with the tiny bit I used.",5
B0C2HTXP49,"I needed the glue to attach torn material in a place that I couldn't reach by sewing.This seemed to work, but a but messy to use.When the glue dries, it will leave white stains if too much is applied beyond the work area.I recommend practice with scrap material.",4
B0C2HTXP49,Easy to use.  No mess,5
B0C2HTXP49,The adhesive is thin so my first attempt the adhesive was absorbed by my jeans and didn't stick together. My second attempt I used clothes pins to hold the material together for several hours. Worked 90% of the time.Don't know about longevity or how it holds up to wash. Looks like it should in cold water.,4
B0C2HTXP49,"I bought this product to glue on upholstery trim. I secure the trim with needles while drying. The glue is fairly liquid, not tacky, so it does need to be firmly secured. It dries in a reasonable time of a few hours and stays put.I had expected this glue to not have much odor, but it does have a strong smell and to me, smells a bit toxic. As a result, I did choose to use this glue while wearing the same type of mask I use for spray painting (A 3M mask with an appropriate vapor cartridge.) I also use it in an area that I don't normally spend time in so that I can leave afterward. I would not recommend this glue for people sensitive to scents or chemicals, or for using with kids.",5
B0C2HTXP49,Dries darker than the color of the fabric,4
B0C2HTXP49,"So I tried to use this stuff to add pockets to an apron.  The consistency is like that of rubber cement when it's fresh, uncured, a little thicker than superglue.  I hoped it would gel up or get sticky, something, anything.  I applied a liberal amount, since it was thick canvas and I wasn't too worried about bleed through anyway.  There was no tack at all for at least an hour.  Most of it seemed to absorb into the fabric, but in some spots after an hour you could see some strings of adhesion starting.  In fairness, the instructions do make it clear to wait 24hrs, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but if you're like me and want something that works right away, this is not it.  I have used a product called Tear Mender that works fairly well, and very quickly, but is messy and gummy, and will bleed through if you put too much on.  3m super 77 spray adhesive is still the best option I've found for a permanent bond.  For my apron, I ended up using https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN5JJG7N?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details and it stuck instantly and extremely well.  Highly recommend.",2
B0C2HTXP49,"Easy to apply, works insanely well and dries VERY QUICKLY. I used this to repair a small area run my cat uses to sharpen his claws on. Some of the carpet fluff was separating from the back part of the rug. It seemed like a simple fix for someone who knows nothing about fixing area rugs, just slab some glue in the separting seams and let it dry. You can see the glue when dried but I was also using layers and layers of the glue for my little project. So I would definitely use this on heavier fabrics. The glue even survived several washes. I'm sure it would stick on thinner fabrics but I don't think it would put on anything lighter than maybe cotton.",5
B0C2HTXP49,I needed something to glue a paper tissue like fabric onto a plush and this worked great,4
B0C2HTXP49,i ordered this product to try it on my tee shirt pockets. the tee shirts were in good shape but the pockets were coming unthreaded. i have used the fabric glue on 3 tee shirts and so far the glued parts are holding good.,5
B0C2HTXP49,Tried on blue jeans and would not stick,3
B0C2HTXP49,Okay,3
B0C2HTXP49,"I use this glue for my amigurumi eyes and gluing my yarn pieces, I don't want to sew. It holds and dries clear.it also comes with a little tool that's great for spreading and cleaning up excess. In the pic it shows the size differences from my old 1 and it's definitely influenced my next purchase and what I will buy when I run out the tip is metal and not plastic and less waste my old one was busted on arrival. and when I opened it to use the product kept flowing out and caused excess amount to come out so I got more than I needed and the  glue was wasted. But this one this bigger one didn't have that issue and I will definitely be a repeat customer to this 1",5
B0C2HTXP49,"Product didn't work as expected for my project, easy to use, but adhesion was not strong enough.",4
B0C2HTXP49,"This  glue is NOT what I thought it was yesterday.  It stuck to the backing of the velcro patch very well, but it DID NOT stick to the nylon/polyester fabric on my hat.  It peeled off the hat, almost without leaving a TRACE; like it had not been there (see photo)!!!  Maybe the hat's fabric is not porous enough???  The patch backing stuck long enough to be sewn in place, which I was trying to avoid by using this glue!!",2
B0C2HTXP49,"Great fabric glue, a little provides great hold.  Used for felted animal assembling for mobile and garland.  Small precision tip, felt fabric makes it difficult to use at times as the glue and tip pick up fibers and build up can occur.  Able to remove build up with a twist of paper or fingers, tweezers that were in use with project.  Strongly suggest glue remover kept handy for cleanup of fingers and any tools used during construction process while using glue.  Dries relatively quickly, depending on material used and stay together.  Recommend",5
B0C2HTXP49,"It comes with a small needle like projection under the cap, which goes into the nozzle keeping it open for the next use. It really does work fantastic. I've used for several projects, comes out in a thin bead, so you don't need to use in excess. Well worth the money. Will definitely get more when I'm running low.",5
B0C2HTXP49,wash cotton clothes (with holes) and cotton patches.glue patches over holes plus weight.can use wax paper to keep from gluing to floor and weight.,5
B0C2HTXP49,Interior car fabric came loose with this Texas heat. This glue fixed it immediately.,5
B0C2HTXP49,This glue is so fast! Repairs done quickly. Great for patches on anything.,5
B0C2HTXP49,"Like the glue came with a pin like lid so it wouldn't stop up next time you needed it. It worked great on my tee shirt had tare under the arm, wash shirt after 24 hours. Glue held it in place.",5
B0C2HTXP49,I glued on the 3 patches on the left sleeve of my sweatshirt hoodie. I applied a moderate amount of fabric glue to the patches and set some heavy books on top for 30 minutes. The patches adhered perfectly. The fabric glue was easy to use because of the metal tip allowed for precise gluing. There is a moderately strong glue smell. I will update after washing and drying if there are any issues. But initially I am pleased with the results so far.,5
B0C2HTXP49,It is easy to use and it allows the owner a longer time to wear a garment that fits,5
B0C2HTXP49,Its ok,4
B0C2HTXP49,Fixed my jeans.,5
B0C2HTXP49,Best glue for fabrics; easy to use and does a perfect job every time.,5
B0C2HTXP49,"I used this fabric glue to patch up a small rip I noticed in one of my favorite skirts. I literally was devastated when I saw the rip and contemplated throwing out my skirt. However, my mother mentioned trying fabric glue, I landed on this one, and the rest is history. I love this glue! It was super easy to use, the dry time was reasonable, and I know have my favorite skirt looking like new again. I've already washed my skirt several times and the glue is still holding strong. Super happy with this glue!",5
B0C2HTXP49,"The tip is great. Made of medal, easy to clean and it did not clog. The cap had a medal insert that was a great help in keeping it from clogging at the application point. However, the glue soaks into the fabric and spreads quickly leaving nothing to adhere. I had to press down on the two pieces and hold for a good while. Sometimes it never stuck. I am applying trim and I used all of the glue, most of it going back over what I had already glued while holding it down. It took way too much time. It needs to have quicker adhesion.  It had almost no smell, which is far better than most of the other brands. I had to go back to 6000 to finish the project. I'll be able to breathe again by November.",3
B0C2HTXP49,"Works really well , drys quickly and sets up",5
B0C2HTXP49,"Was pleasantly surprised. Have used another brand to prevent fraying. This, by far, beats the name brand hands-down. Had sewn a zipper on a purse. Realized that I didn't pick up all 3 layers of fabric. Left a fray. Used this product hoping it would work. It dries clear! No stain at all. Couldn't even tell the glue was applied. I'm sold!",5
B0C2HTXP49,"I only use this once so fat but was very happy with the results. It took only minutes to use. I just applied it according to the instructions and left it set according to the instructions and I was done, I didn't have to drag out my sewing machine.",5
B0C2HTXP49,Needed to add a wide ribbon to the bottom of curtains and the glue worked great. Not messy,5
B0C2HTXP49,I've used this to fix a jacket pocket which seemed to have delaminated and used it to attach loop patches to a travel bag.  Both times I clamped the pieces of material I was gluing together for about 30 minutes and all glued pieces seem very strong. I don't plan to wash the bag nor jacket but may try this on a shirt later.  Very happy with this product so far as it saved me the hassle of buying an industrial sewing machine and having to learn how to use it.,5
B0C2HTXP49,"I use this to secure the ends of my yarn after I weave in the tails...I hate those pop up bits!  I love the micro tip and the needle cap to prevent drying out. As for the smell, that is going to be a personal preference.  I did not find it strong or lingering, whilst some reviews sounded as though it was overwhelming.  It would be worth going outdoors to use it if you must, it works that well.",5
B0C2HTXP49,Pretty good glue for fabric,4
B0C2HTXP49,The tip makes it easy to use.  But use it sparingly because it does bleed through the material if too much is used.,4
B0C2HTXP49,"I am thrilled to have found this product!  I am a senior citizen who has been mending clothes for my children and grandchildren for many years.  Now with arthritis in my hands, this product has made it possible for me to still do repairs without mending.  This goes on clear and really holds the torn material together with a strong bond!! Great price for 2 tubes of this amazing product!  Truly an innovative alternative to sewing by hand!!  Very happy with this purchase!!",5
B0C2HTXP49,Only downfall 48 hour cure time,4
B0C2HTXP49,Shows more that I would like,3
B0C2HTXP49,"I love it.  I sewed 20 trivets and used the glue to close the last small openings, where I had turned them right side out.  The glue spread out perfectly with the small elongated nozzle.  I could even reposition the fabric right away when I needed to.",5
B0C2HTXP49,As described,4
B0C2HTXP49,"The B-7000 style adhesive is the new standard for super rubber cements.I have been using these for years but had one problem, they tended to thicken in the tube over time until unusable.This brand is as strong as the ones I used to get but its shelf life is 3 or 4 times longer making it much more usable.I can now buy it in larger tubes making it less expensive as well.  A win / win!",5
B0C2HTXP49,Ok,4
B0C2HTXP49,I used this on my husband motorcycle patch and it held but for extra I sewed around it lengthy strides with the needle but over all seamed to have worked.,5
B0C2HTXP49,"Much better than crazy glue, but probably needs a couple of applications and some thing heavy to be laid on top of it to make sure that the glue stays. Give it 24 hours under something heavy. Works well with patches though.",4
B0C2HTXP49,Works great,4
B0C2HTXP49,"I have several cloth badges for meeting certain goals from People for Bikes.  I have cloth panniers and did not want to sew them on as I would be defeating the waterproofing by putting holes in the bags.  This glue works well.  After a few days, I got caught in a rainstorm and the badges are still adhered to the bags.",5
B0C2HTXP49,"I used this adhesive for a seam that had come apart, and it seems to have worked well, being more stretchy and useful than I had thought it might be.  My hopes are high that it will hold through a machine wash and dry.",4
B0C2HTXP49,Good product,4
B0C2HTXP49,Works well if you follow the instructions and do not over do it by putting too much glue.  It is difficult to get it exactly right so you have to be patient. I recommend you watch the video.,5
B0C2HTXP49,Works great.,5
B0C2HTXP49,I liked the product and it worked well.  I glued trim back on a blanket. I washed the blanket and the trim stayed on.,5
B08TWB425H,They seem to stick and stay and that's important. Variety of designs are nice.,5
B08TWB425H,Gifted this to my grandchild who was so excited when the gift was opened and has enjoyed taping up lots of yard sticks into coloring creatures.,5
B08TWB425H,They are beautiful and dress up even plain cardboard!  New rolls are a little difficult to start and prone to tearing but they cut easily into whatever size piece you need,5
B08TWB425H,"4/5 stars because the product photo shows much more vibrant colours than the actual product (right). I purchased this product for the bright single color fluoro tapes, especially the blue and orange, but they are not as bright as expected.",4
B08TWB425H,Great washi tape quality. The right adhesive strength that I needed. The quantity and variety was what I wanted.,5
B08TWB425H,Bought it for my seven year-old granddaughter and she loved it,5
B08TWB425H,good,5
B08TWB425H,This set of tape rolls is a fun addition to our craft materials. Even a four year old can think of good uses for it!,5
B08TWB425H,This item is is doing the job.,4
B08TWB425H,"As I just received this Washi tape, I have not yet used it.  However, it came packaged in a beautiful sturdy box; inside the box the Washi tape was secured by plastic film - these rolls weren't going anywhere!  The tapes are just lovely and I find that if I need to, I can cut them to slimmer lengths to fit around the frame of a coloring picture.  Very nice and I truly appreciate the extra care for packaging.",5
B08TWB425H,L:ittle kids love tape!,5
B08TWB425H,Not alot on each roll.,4
B08TWB425H,My grandkids had a lot of fun creating with this multi pack of washi tape. There are a lot of styles and plenty to work with.,5
B08TWB425H,they're pretty ugly tbh but I made it work,3
B08TWB425H,"They don't even fill the tiny box. They don't stick to diamond art trays or canvases(both types). They don't even stick to themselves. Once you use it, the edge where you stopped won't stay stuck to the roll. It curls up and gets stuck to the other rolls. They roll up constantly on whatever you put them on. Yes I've cleaned the surfaces and tried all the tricks. It's just really bad tape. Both boxes I got on here are. Really old tape or just terrible quality. They are super tiny rolls too. Maybe 1mm to 3mm thick rolls so barely anything. Nothing like the pictures at all. Of course amazon doesn't care. They make returns impossible. So they get to sell fraudulent garbage like this and make money without having to give it back. I reported this months ago and it's still up with the same fraudulent pictures of big thick rolls.",1
B08TWB425H,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday last month, she is a washi tape hoarder. Before I wrote this review I asked her what she thought. She told me, ""It doesn't stick [correction: it sticks very well to your carpeting], and it ruins the paper when you take it off."" She was unpeeling the piece of washi that did stick to her project, and this piece peeled a few layers off the paper, ruining her project. So don't waste your money is my advice. While it is nice looking, functionally it's trash.",4
B08TWB425H,Toddler loves playing with these!,4
B08TWB425H,These are wonderful!  They stick perfectly and can be taken off easily if they need to be adjusted and still stick perfectly!,5
B08TWB425H,"I bought this set of washi tape to use in my planner, and I have been extremely happy with the purchase so far. I have purchased large counts of tape in the past for cheap only to be disappointed in the quality, but that was not the case at all with this set. The tape is of standard washi material and it sticks well to my planner pages. I have seen some reviews talking about how the tape is transparent, and I agree. It is not completely opaque, but I've never expected washi tape to ever be 100% opaque.If you're looking to cover up anything with your tape, I would recommend thicker tapes, but if you're looking to use this for mostly decorative purposes, look no further.",5
B08TWB425H,Kids loved it and that's what's important.,5
B08TWB425H,Love the tape it's like masking tape for children .the print is incredible into details so much art you can do.,5
B08TWB425H,Kids love them!!,5
B08TWB425H,Easy to use,4
B08TWB425H,These tapes are very creative. The patterns pretty much goes with anything. The amount per roll is deceiving compared to the pic! Be sure to measure first!,4
B08TWB425H,"Not nearly as vibrant as the picture, and some of the patterns use completely different colors or are not included. However, the packaging is very cute and thoughtful, and the price is good for the number of rolls.",4
B08TWB425H,Stays adhered to the surface without sticky residue when removed. My Grandson sticks the tape everywhere without his Mom worrying about it being hard to remove.,5
B08TWB425H,I brought this product for a project for my daughter. I discovered that the tape isn't easy to start and it doesn't have a durable hold. It's not like regular tape. This tape isn't sticky and it really doesn't hold items together very well,3
B08TWB425H,Great variety for a very reasonable price!,5
B08TWB425H,Just average,3
B08TWB425H,Good product!,4
B08TWB425H,I got the tape as a gift for a young creative person for their birthday they were thrilled.,5
B08TWB425H,Great for pinata filler!,5
B08TWB425H,the rolls were alot smaller then expected - but we made due.,5
B08TWB425H,Patterns are darker then the picture. The tape is also see through. Great concept but disappointed,3
B08TWB425H,While there are indeed 40 rolls ... they fit into a 5 inch square box ... so not quite what I expected. BUT our 9 year old crafty granddaughter will love the colors,4
B08TWB425H,I didn't notice the size thought I was ordering duck tape  for goat horns so it has to go back,2
B08TWB425H,"My granddaughters loved this tape, fun designs and colors.",5
B08TWB425H,I love this washi tape it great. wonderful colors and I use it all the time.,5
B08TWB425H,These are better then the other batch I had and I love the designs on them.,5
B08TWB425H,Variety pack led to unique creations.,5
B08TWB425H,"These worked well for glitter pens.  I also used the colors I didn't care for to secure small items in place while glue dried.  It holds well, but comes off easily and leaves no residue behind.The one thing I was disappointed with was that the colors are much darker in person, making some of the patterns harder to see, but overall I am satisfied with them.",4
B08TWB425H,I bought this to section off my diamond painting pattern & it worked perfectly. I did not want or need for it to be super adhesive sticky to my pattern and it is just the right thing for my use. It peels off without causing damage. I highly recommend it if you are not wanting or needing for it to hold things together as a long term bond. I will definitely be buying it again!,5
B08TWB425H,"They really are not as bad as a lot of the reviews are saying. They look dark in the package but as you can see in the picture I provided, the colors pop once rolled out. There are a few that are darker then expected but still not bad. I don't see a problem with the adhesive. They stick on paper and stay down.",4
B08TWB425H,Bought my 4y/o old who loves art and crafts. She loves it. Beautiful designes. Great quality and easy to use,5
B08TWB425H,Lots of choices and beautiful colors!,5
B08TWB425H,I got these tapes for my Sunday school class. They enjoyed the tape more than stickers.,5
B08TWB425H,"This is a great little set for your crafty people. Cute designs, not too much of any one tape, not too thick and intrusive. Just right for adding a splash of whimsy to stuff, which makes my elementary girl happy :).",5
B08TWB425H,I bought this for my wife because she is really into scrapbooking. With this kit she has 40 different rolls to choose from and was very happy with how sticky they are. I would buy again if she needs more.,5
B08TWB425H,love the colors,5
B08TWB425H,"The variety and quantity of rolls for the price is great for crafting projects. The solid colors, however, were disappointing. This product was purchased for the bright magenta-pink/purple, turquoise, green colors. These colors were muted. The designs on some of the tapes do not appear as bright and crisp as the photo provided by the seller.",3
B08TWB425H,The box is great for keeping all the tapes together.  Includes a nice variety but they are not as bright as the picture shows.,4
B08TWB425H,Washi tape 40 rolls I got this for my grandma because she lives at a nursing home snd she really enjoy doin scrapbooking it is very sticky snd very easy to use so if you are a scrapbooked you will really love these washi tapes,5
B08TWB425H,"I bought these for my son and nieces (ages 7-10) to use for their arts and craft time. They were perfect for them! I had to get the tape rolls started but then they could peel and tear on their own. The tape didn't adhere very well but we didn't care because we were just using it for play. Very colorful and fun designs, only a couple duplicate designs. The kids loved it!",4
B08TWB425H,Tape set was wonderful,5
B08TWB425H,Had old envalopes that needed to be taped to seal them. The tape was the perfect solution.  Looked cute and sealed the envelopes.,4
B08TWB425H,Really cute,5
B08TWB425H,I was searching for washi tape I can use for journaling and these are perfect.  Offers a wide variety of color and reasonably priced.,5
B08TWB425H,"This washi tape set is a great value for the price.There are multiple fun designs and solid colors.  The tape is thin, and easy to rip or cut.  It is great for craft projects for kids.  It doesn't always stick super tightly, but for most projects it works great.",4
B08TWB425H,My daughter use them for her art class and she really enjoys every pattern on it.,4
B08TWB425H,The selection of tapes was not as shown. Half were very dark.,4
B08TWB425H,I got this for two kids - a boy and a girl whom I babysit occasionally. For 9$ the set is cheap enough to use for a multitude of projects and not to worry if the next purchase is needed. It is a better deal than a Dollar store or Michaels. The good part it has solid colors as well fun design. The even better part it pills off easily from the kitchen granite without leaving spots when the kids are not careful.,5
B08TWB425H,very colorful and decorative,5
B08TWB425H,I like there were lots of different colours and they are quite thin so you can easily stick them in a notebook to quite good quality,5
B08TWB425H,Lots of fun- different styles are great. Sticky- but comes off easy without removing paint,5
B08TWB425H,I picked these bc the pic showed vibrant rainbow colored tapes. They were almost all dark jewel tones. The white tapes were completely see thru,1
B08TWB425H,This is a great deal on washi tape. I love the colors and fun patterns - so did my kid! Some colors are more sheer than others in the box but overall I like the tape.,5
B08TWB425H,I bought these for my granddaughters who love arts and crafts. They are beautiful but so hard to get started. Wish they would peel a bit easier.,4
B08TWB425H,I ordered this to split with a couple friends for diamond painting. I love all the colors and variety. I spent like 30 minutes just sorting through and deciding if I was actually willi g to give any up. I think this one purchase has started a washi tape addiction and I can't wait to order more.,5
B08TWB425H,Good value for the money,5
B08TWB425H,We have purchased two sets of this tape.  My son refers to himself as an artist and loves to customize his figurines.  This allows him to do so without the changes being permanent.,5
B08TWB425H,Good tape but the plain colors are a little too bold for my taste. Works as advertised and price is good for the quantity.,4
B08TWB425H,"The Amazon page for this product is obviously photoshopped and color edited.  The actual colors are quite dark.  In the solids, there is one true yellow and that's about the only one that matches the picture.  Orange?  Nope.  Pink?  Nope.  Bright purple?  Nope.  Bright blue?  Nope.  Apple Green?  Nope.  Instead it's maroon and brick and navy and a muddy yellow and so on.  The printed ones are similarly dark, so much so that they are almost unrecognizable.  This isn't a 'difference in computer screen' issue.  It's a drastic difference.  And reading the reviews too late, many others felt the same way. Having just opened it, I will be returning it and shopping for something more enlivening.",2
B08TWB425H,Nice,5
B08TWB425H,The variety of colors and styles is amazing.  I love the width.  Great washi tape set.,5
B08TWB425H,I have only used it once so far to go around the edge of a Diamond painting and really liked it. The only problem is deciding which one to use.,5
B08TWB425H,so it's tape and it looks liek the pic lol not much to say,4
B08TWB425H,Not a lot of tape on each roll. But i was able to finish my project,4
B08XYXX69T,These mats are what you expect they are great standard grip mats I've used 1 out of the package at least 10 times already and it's keeping it's tack I would definitely buy these again,5
B08XYXX69T,"I will never by name brand mats ever again!  These are so sticky and work just like Cricut brand if not better. Also cost a fraction of the price and get a lot more bang for your buck. This is the second time in a couple years I ended new mats. I have tried to revive my old ones, but with the price of these it makes no sense.",5
B08XYXX69T,Excellent quality and value,5
B08XYXX69T,"I will say these are slightly less sticky than the Cricut mats, but very close. They are a tiny bit thinner than the Cricut mats but it doesn't affect the use of them. I haven't had to adjust pressure on my Cricut or anything. These are VERY small differences. Tiny. For the price you just can't beat the value. I mean, how much should it cost to buy a plastic sheet with some repositionable glue on it? The markup on these mats is incredible no matter where you buy them, but especially through Cricut. And although I would like to support Cricut and purchase everything from them, (because I do appreciate and purchase other Cricut products,)buying their mats just isn't the economically smart thing to do. I don't have extra money to  throw away, so I have to go with the better deal. I highly recomend these mats. Use a repositionable glue stick if you want to make them stickier.",5
B08XYXX69T,Absolutely love these. Great quality and perfect stickiness. I use them daily.,5
B08XYXX69T,Work just as well as the more expensive mats.,5
B08XYXX69T,"The grip, cutting quality, and fit are an exact match to expensive store brands where you usually only get ONE mat. You need these! Trust me.",5
B08XYXX69T,They are great and are very sticky and holds down glitter htv great,5
B08XYXX69T,Pretty decent quality for price,5
B08XYXX69T,Great l love it.,5
B08XYXX69T,Great generic brand mats for Cricut,5
B08XYXX69T,good quality,5
B08XYXX69T,These mats are just sticky enough.  They work equally as well as Cricut mats and are considerably cheaper. I will definitely order more of them.,4

B08XYXX69T,Product arrived fast and as described,5
B08XYXX69T,I like them. I use them with my cricut,5
B08XYXX69T,I have a full time Etsy shop cutting lots and lots of cardstock with the cricut. I have used these mats for a while now and they seemed to be great. Recently it seems they are really losing their stickiness. I am going through them way too fast. I go through two mats a day. That's way too many.,4
B08XYXX69T,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These work just as they should on my Cricut Maker. It's a great value for the price.,5
B08XYXX69T,"Product arrived as expected. Haven't used the Cricut version, so unable to compare. But held the htv/iron-ons well and worked well with my explore air 2",5
B08XYXX69T,"Nothing really bad to say, sticky enough. Easy to use, fits in cricut, bendable.",5
B08XYXX69T,It works perfectly. Nice tacky surface for holding paper and vinyl in place. Multi-pack means I'll always be ready for crafting. Matis sturdy but still flexible. Makes working on my Cricut so enjoyable.,5
B08XYXX69T,"Have only cut some vinyl sticker-type designs so far, but some of them were intricate and these sheets worked fine for them",5
B08XYXX69T,"Good price, good value.  Would by again.",5
B08XYXX69T,Great quality for price! Just as durable and sticky as brand name mats. Now I have one for every medium I work with.,5
B08XYXX69T,These work just as well as the brand name ones and are MUCH cheaper. Will definitely buy again.,5
B08XYXX69T,"works great, good grip",5
B08XYXX69T,These worked great. Very sticky. Great price,5
B08XYXX69T,"These are just so expensive to purchase and when you are crafting your little heart out, you need to make sure you have enough backups (because who wants to clean and wait for something to dry in the middle of your work?!).",5
B08XYXX69T,These work great.,5
B08XYXX69T,"Not overly sticky on first use, just right.",5
B08XYXX69T,I got my stuff in just a couple days everything was real good,5
B08XYXX69T,I do a lot of print & cut for my business and these are great. Last at least as long as the name brand.,5
B08XYXX69T,I have had these mats before and they're great but if they're not shipped in a box they get bend and messed up making them unusable in a cricut or scanning machine,4
B08XYXX69T,These were just as good as the cricut mats. Sometimes I think even better because they have a much longer lifespan.,5
B08XYXX69T,"I saw good reviews on these, so I decided to try them out. The mats are sticky and have worked just like a cricut brand mat. You get more of these for cheaper and they work the same!",5
B08XYXX69T,I wanted to pay less for mats and what a bargain.  I used it with iron on & paper and the stickiness is great.,5
B08XYXX69T,I run an etsy shop selling made to order vinyl stickers and these have been my go to base for my Cricut.  I have almost 3000 sales and these have been a huge cost savings.  I do a lot of cutting for a laser engraving store I run as well and these work really well as cut mats once the adhesion wears down.,5
B08XYXX69T,Excellent worked better than the circuit at a better price.,5
B08XYXX69T,"Our old mats were losing their grip so we ordered these to replace them. These are great. They're perfect replacements. They are great quality and have a good grip on the vinyl. We're sensitive to smells, and I don't notice anything offensive about these. I have no complaints.",5
B08XYXX69T,Using it for making projects on my Cricut Cutting Machine.,5
B08XYXX69T,These work as well Cricuit brand. I have never had success cleaning mats. I use them and they last as well as Cricuit.,5
B08XYXX69T,Great purchase at a great price,5
B08XYXX69T,"Compared to the standard Cricut mats, the quality is excellent and actually seems to hold the stickiness longer. Love that they come in a multipack because they do inevitably have to be replaced after a certain amount of use.",5
B08XYXX69T,Great condition,5
B08XYXX69T,"Just perfect, great price as well.",5
B08XYXX69T,Good,5
B08XYXX69T,Right size! It sticks!,5
B08XYXX69T,"There's a residue that it leaves on projects that leaves them a bit sticky, too.  I wouldn't use with card stock or light paper because what sticks to it really sticks to it, and because of the residue, I'd stick with something where there is a backing that can be sacrificed like vinyl or sticker paper.I plan to wash them to see if some of that lingering residue goes away.",3
B08XYXX69T,"These seem to be very good, I have used them before and they seem to last",5
B08XYXX69T,Needed new mats for my Cricut.  Someone recommended these.  So happy I listened to their suggestion.  Great price!,5
B08XYXX69T,"Was exactly what I wanted, but the best part was the price.",5
B08XYXX69T,La verdad me gusta este producto funciona bien con cameo 4 sin problemas,5
B08XYXX69T,Buen producto y buena calidad!!!Lo uso para mi trabajo,5
B08XYXX69T,great product.  will buy from them again if need to.  holds the project to the mat,5
B08XYXX69T,These are actually really good. Save yourself some money and buy these instead. So much better than the Cricut brand. They actually last a lot longer too!!!!,5
B08XYXX69T,I use the mats for crafting and they perform the same as Cricut mats. I buy them because I can afford the cost.,4
B08XYXX69T,They are better than normal Cricut mats,5
B08XYXX69T,"My wife says these work very well with her Criqut machine. Stays nice n sticky, I guess.",5
B08XYXX69T,These are ok. I use a lot of felt and these don't last as long as some other off brands.,4
B08XYXX69T,"I'd love it if the company reached out to me on this issue...I've let them know of the problem through Amazon but have not heard anything back.  They are not as flexible as Cricut mats, so be careful when bending to get the paper off without curling.  The stickiness seems to last about the same, a few cuts before cleaning good, then have to toss after about 9-10 cuts.  My main issue was the crack/snapping, as were a bit brittle (and I didn't even bend very tightly.  If I hear back from the vendor I will re-do the review.",4
B08XYXX69T,"These are great!  Just as good as the cricut brand mat, just way cheaper!",5
B08XYXX69T,They are inexpensive and serve their purpose.  Not as durable or sticky as the name brand.,4
B08XYXX69T,I used it for my Cricut,5
B08XYXX69T,This is a nice package of 8.,5
B08XYXX69T,Better than Cricut brand cutting mats,5
B08XYXX69T,Do not buy for silhouette.,4
B08XYXX69T,"Very good mats, they are super sticky. I love the value I get for the money. I would say that just like every other fabric mat, after at least 10 fabrics you will have to  wash your mat to get the residue off. I scrub with dawn and let air dry and they go back to being sticky.",5
B08XYXX69T,"I have only used these once, but I am so far pleased with them.",5
B08XYXX69T,Better than name brand and much more affordable. Purchased for my wife so she has plenty of backup as they do wear out over time,5
B08XYXX69T,I bought these for a project I am working on. They have lasted without losing too much sticky after several uses. There is a sticky residue on everything though. For what I'm doing it will be fine but for other projects these won't work.,3
B08XYXX69T,"I got these because a certain brand of cutter only uses its software. Said software is buggy. So, to fully utilize the cuttable area of my sticker paper, per the buggy software, I have to tell it the paper is 11x17. Which means, a 12x12 mat won't work. 12x24 to the rescue!! It works. Now I can cut my 8"" circular pattern on my 8.5""x11"" sticker paper. If only I had known about Insect Brand's bad software before I invested so much into it. Le Sigh. But these are great for longer works of art anyway.",5
B08XYXX69T,These are great for use w my cricket especially for the price.,5
B08XYXX69T,I would buy these again.,4
B08XYXX69T,They are good quality mats and I think they would be good for vinyl or heavier products. They are way to sticky to be considered a Light grip mat and not good for paper or card stock projects.,3
B08XYXX69T,These mats work great. Easy to clean for extended use.,5
B08XYXX69T,Great for any crafter. Has held up nicely.,4
B08XYXX69T,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I feel like no matter what brand you get they always wear. I love that they come in a package of 8 which last me so much longer and they are so much more cost affective! Will buy again!,5
B08XYXX69T,Great price and will order again,5
B08XYXX69T,Works the same as originals. Fit is the same,5
B07V5FFPWC,I loved everything about it easy to use,5
B07V5FFPWC,"This review will be edited time to time for updates!(UPDATE) Still a great silicone product for beginners! I made a second mold and made things in my first mold to compare them to their originals. I will be attaching another photo. Left is originals, right is copies from being in the mold(besides the cookies, I accidentally switched those.) I will upload a pic of my second mold as well! I am going to be switching to another molding product soon as I feel I want a tougher silicone but this was so fun to work with and such an inexpensive option for those who just want to make a few things on hand for back up pieces. My second mold's silicone was mixed more thoroughly than my first and cured much faster. The first mold took about 3 days to not be sticky because I didn't stir very well. make sure if you're using tape on the bottom when pouring and make sure you are taping very FLAT and fold the edges upward around your container because even with hot glue you can get leaks!1st Impressions: LOVE! Very easy to work with, mixes easily and adding a little mica powder for some fun color was NO problem. I only had to wait 3-4 hours to take it out but I'd suggest you wait the entire 24. I think I may have ripped a teeny part on accident pulling it up out of impatience. I am attaching a photo of my mold. I needed extras of pieces I use for personal use. You can never have too many cabochons! I will come back and post pics of pieces made in the mold and update with how the mold did! Sorry the designs are so hard to see in the photo, the mica powder is pearlized.BY THE WAY: I had 1 TEENY bubble and I checked my piece to make sure it wasn't the issue but it may have been because it was slightly not flat in the area it bubbled. Nothing a quick glaze or dome can't fix. The silicone seems strong but I am still waiting to use it as it has only been 12 hours and I want to make sure I don't ruin it. If your mold is still sticky in ANY spots either you did not mix properly or you need to let it cure a LOT more.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"I have used this silicon several times now and feel confident enough to leave a good review. The silicon mixes and pours easily. It cures well and quickly without sticking to the the medium in which you are casting in the mold. I have even used crystals and rocks and had no issues removing the crystals from the mold without tearing the mold or breaking the delicate crystals. It is worth noting that I did not use a release agent either. The price is at a good point, especially on sell and Let's Resin is a well trusted brand. I have bought from them for years and will continue to do so due to the quality of their products.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"My first ever mold pour ever.  I didn't want to make the challenge too simple, so I used it to cast a mold of an ornate detailed frame corner of a 100 year old French mirror.  Another corner had been smashed off (made of plaster) so I cast the cleanly prepared different corner and prayed.  It was impossible to enclose the corner perfectly, I did my best.  I poured the mix into my hopeful corner enclosure, and sure enough little rivulets of mix oozed out in about 6 places.  I did the only thing I could do... for about an hour, I used a putty knife blade to gather the small puddles and return the mix to the top of my pour enclosure.  I needed it for the full coverage of the high point.  It finally started to thicken up so I stopped spooning and ran away, hoping I didn't ruin this customer antique restoration.  Part of the pour was as deep as 2-1/2 inches so I gave the batch 3 days to fully cure.  It took a while to coax the enclosure/solidified pour off of the mirror frame corner, but it finally released cleanly.  Now I have to pour plaster mix into my new mold and hope again.  I also hope I will be able to thoroughly clean the corner that was cast, because it is covered with residue of silicon, not a good base for paint.  Bottom line, I would buy again.",5
B07V5FFPWC,This product worked great and easy to use.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I wanted to like this product, but I'm honestly stunned at all the high reviews. It makes no sense. I've been using silicone products professionally for YEARS and this stuff is a genuine enigma. It does NOT fully cure, leaving a very sticky residue - high accurate ratio and mixed more than enough time. Not mixing enough  does NOT just cause the top of molds to remain sticky. If it is a mixing issue, the entire mold would be affected, not just on the top where air hits it. This a batch/formula issue.  Cure inhibition you may say? No. That's NOT it either. I have experimented with this stuff multiple times, and even have used inhibitX on cast parts, and it STILL does not fully cure leaving a disgusting sticky tacky surface. Environmental conditions are perfect, and I have no issues with curing any other silicone product such as those from Smooth On. I'm feeling really ripped off too because this behaves VERY similarity to another OEM product that I've used, so I'm thinking this is just a private label of the same exact product. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted trying to make this product work correctly. I'm not saying someone might be able to get lucky results if the exact ""unknown"" criteria for all conditions is met EXACTLY for this product to cure, but I can tell you now, it's not a product to get if you just want a decent platinum silicone to work with at an affordable price. NEVER buying this again, and NEVER suggesting it to anyone.  Total waste of time and money.",1
B07V5FFPWC,"Worked great!  Im a first time user.  I made a mold of ""rosette"" on an old porch column.  Cast the new piece in resin.  Once painted it was a perfect match.",5
B07V5FFPWC,Purchased this for the wife to make their own candle molds. no spills on arrival so thats always a plus. They have yet to use it so I'm unsure of it's quality.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I received this product, dumped the liquid from each bottle into a bowl, stirred for about 4 minutes, then poured the mix into my mold to make a seal for a 36"" by 16"" case for testing air quality monitors.  I waited a day, and the seal that I had poured was still in a liquid state.  To my surprise, and the reason the seal was still liquid, is because both bottles contained the same formula.  Part A and Part B was exactly the same, so why the solution didn't solidify.  I contacted the seller, and have not received any response from them, so I cannot recommend this product to anyone without saying that Please make sure that both bottles contain the appropriate liquid before mixing, and wasting your time.  It is taking me a number of days trying to drain and clean out my mold so that I can do another pour with a different product from someone else.  This goes to quality control, and obviously there is none, and also the customer support is definitely not there either, so buy at your own risk...Update: I would like to say a big thank you to the seller, as they finally contacted me, and ultimately corrected the problem by sending out a set of correctly labeled bottles.  The seller went above and beyond to resolve the issue I had with getting a messed up order.  Just PLEASE, be very careful when getting yours, that you first do a small test mix to make sure you don't have the frustration I had.  Both A and B parts look exactly the same, so when I received miss-labeled bottles, I couldn't tell before mixing that it was not going to set up before creating a huge mess for myself - that took 3 days to get cleaned up before making a new pour with a set of properly labeled bottles of silicone.  I wanted to do the right thing by updating my experience with the sellers' help and support, and also why I changed the 1 star to 5, because when it works - it works great, so just be careful to do a small test mix before doing a major pour like I did, because whatever hair you have left - you want to keep LOL.",5
B07V5FFPWC,It was easy to use and the forms came out beautiful. I would definitely continue re-ordering.,5
B07V5FFPWC,Excelente producto de gran calidad,5
B07V5FFPWC,This should come with better instructions but it worked.  Watch a you tube video. It is a good product,4
B07V5FFPWC,I challenge you to make your own action figure,5
B07V5FFPWC,"Made a picky pad for fidgeting/adhd. Worked great! This one is about 6x4.5x.5 and the kit would make about 3 of these I think. I didn't think to let it thicken, or to make/pour in 2-3 different layers so everything didn't fall to the bottom - but for the next one, I know and will adjust my technique.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"I like the fact that there is no complicated mixing, temperature regulation, etc. you simply pour equal amounts of the silicone mold mixture from each bottle into a bowl, mix it really well for about 90 seconds, then pour the mixture into your mold and set it aside to cure (about 4-6 hours depending on humidity.) The cured product is sturdy, yet flexible and can be colored to any color you like with silicone dyes (sold separately). The only thing I would improve on is the self De-gassing. Though it did degass as it was curing, it still left little small bubbles in the final product.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"New to mold making, great stuff but insufficient, unclear instructions. Discovered needed other supplies so couldn't use until I ordered more stuff, only to find out much of what i ordered was for resin not silicone rubber. I guess I needed to research more before purchasing but it seems like a high quality product and a good company.",4
B07V5FFPWC,Very nice product and will be buying again. I was able to make 6 picky pads with it.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I followed directions , watched other video reviews and my molds came out great. No issues with drying or stickiness",5
B07V5FFPWC,"I purchased this several times in the past because I wanted to experiment with a few things. I actually had stopped using this due to being busy with other stuff but noticed that a year or two later after not using this product, the molds I've done without adding any color would turn yellow. i think the product is good but it's a bummer that it turns yellow.. Not sure if adding color fixes this.",3
B07V5FFPWC,It was good for making stuff,5
B07V5FFPWC,great product and very flexible,4
B07V5FFPWC,Exactly what I wanted. Came just as described and on time.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"It's pretty good silicone comparing it to some of the Smooth-On silicone, and much cheaper than them, I've tried but I ran into an issue of the bubbles not properly degassing, instead getting stuck on some parts of what I was making a mold out of and somewhat messing up the final mold. I did several tests with epoxy and urethane resin to make sure it just wasn't bubbles with epoxy when I discovered the imperfections. Photos show the consistent imperfects circled in red. The 6 out of 9 molds aren't totally ruined but my original intent for the molds has been changed. The d6 had minimal to nonexistent bubbling/divots compared to the rest. Oddly enough my molds of my two 3d printed objects came out fine and there are a lot of ridges the bubbles should have caught compared to the dice.The silicone is fairly easy to mix. I meant to keep track of when it starts to set up to get a gist of its pot life(how much time you have to work with it before it starts to gel up/cure). It did cure in 12 hours, I let mine sit just a bit longer just in case.  I have to say the silicone feels strong, not to tough especially if you do an encapsulating mold and have to cut the sides.I'm making a rough guess but I'm thinking the bubbles got caught on the edges of the dice I was making a mold out of which lead to the deformations. Possible the bubbles may not like items with somewhat intricate detailing, which surprises me as I've never encountered this issue before with other molds I've made. I did the usually moldmaking routine of a light spray of mold release and the needle pour into the lowest section of the mold to help reduce introduction and any further bubbles. So not entirely sure what went wrong.I've emailed the makers/sellers of the silicone, Let's Resin, and will update my review when I get a reply.I do recommend this silicone if you're trying out moldmaking as it's on the cheaper in for 'translucent silicone and other silicone in general. Though it becomes a milky white if what you're making a mold out of requires thicker walls. I do want to give this silicone another try since it does catch detail well on the dice as my photos show",4
B07V5FFPWC,"I like that the price was reasonable, and the item seems to be a very quality item.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"Easy to work with, made molds in good quality.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"Well, I have had this product for over a year and I did that because I need to see how long would the shelflife last. I just now use the product and I am please that it was still good to use ; I like that the shelf life ofthis product is long and this is the one "" I WILL BUY AGAIN "" ; I have not use all of it , Now I will see how long it last once it has been open and some of it has been used. This way I will know if this the sure product for me to use all the time. I am please so for !",5
B07V5FFPWC,This resin is sooo good! Easy to use. Dries nice and clear.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I have a 3d printer and got tired of throwing away my failed prints. I cut a plastic water bottle in half for the mold. I mixed this silicone resin according to the directions and poured it into my prepared mold. The mold cured within a few hours. I was concerned that the resin would make a strong smell, but it's claim of being oderless is true; I couldn't smell it. I then placed the cured mold in a toaster oven at 400 degrees farenheit (oven only used for this project, not with food. and in a well ventilated area) and placed my shredded failed 3d prints into the mold.  The result came out better than I thought, the figurine had as much detail as the original one. Possible air bubbles in the mold seemed to be another concern I had, but after getting the result I did it doesn't seem to be a problem as I didn't use a vacuum chamber. Also, the silicone mold did not warp or fail when heated to 400 degrees so I can reuse it again. Overall, I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to beginners who are not too familiar with silicone resin.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"This silicone is very easy to use and works great. Because it's low viscosity it means there are little to no bubbles without degaussing (no vacuum chamber needed). Of course there is a tradeoff and that is that the molds may not last as long.The silicone is very flexible, like rubber band flexible while some are very stiff so caution will be needed to assure the mold can lay flat and level or it may distort when being used but for single sided molds this should not be much of an issue. I will be back for more.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"The molds last as long as I need them, which is usually a max of five pulls and then into the trash. And the transparency means I can use UV resin and make those five iterations in minutes, not hours or days! I should add that the parts I'm casting are very delicate and detailed. It required figuring out how best to do it, but once figured, it's been smooth sailing.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"First of all, let me say the seller has been very helpful and we communicated several times about the issue with the seller eventually refunding my purchase. Which deserves a 5 star rating for the seller.In the end I suspect the problem might have been this silicone has issues curing if the room temperature is over 28 C. And it's summer here in New Caledonia and the temperature was 28 to 30 when I poured my mold. I was trying to make a mold. I followed directions, mixed 1 to 1 and stirred for several minutes, waited 5 minutes, poured it into my form. Waited 12 hours and some of it was hard, some still liquid. The little bit of residue left in the mixing container hardened OK but not in the form I poured it in. I waited 48 hours. Still not hard. Ambient temperature 28 to 31 C (HOT).Cleaned my form which was a real pain, mixed a new batch stirring it vigorously for 5 minutes, waited 5 minutes, poured it into my form (basically a circular trench 20 mm wide 12mm deep). About 4 hours later the silicone in the pot I mixed it in seemed cured, but when I went to clean it the silicone was still sticky and uncured on the bottom. Same thing in my form, some parts set some areas still liquid. After the very helpful and considerate correspondence with the seller I decided the problem was it was too hot to properly cure.",3
B07V5FFPWC,I wasn't able to pull my molded products out and when cut in half it doesn't seal naturally.,3
B07V5FFPWC,"I was a little concerned after reading about how precise the measuring has to be for this to work properly, but I got great results simply eyeballing the amounts. I used clear plastic container cups that pre-made jello and pudding come in, which were perfect for measuring and mixing small batches and disposable afterwards, cutting down on clean-upI used this for a custom project and it worked exactly as I wanted. It's very versatile and easy to work with, as long as you plan and prep your project carefully and follow the product instructions. It is gooey so be careful how you handle it. If estimating how much to mix, mixing less rather than more makes sense. You'll have less waste and can quickly mix more if you're short.My project dried pretty hard, about the consistency of a pencil eraser, but I poured it about three-quarters inch thick. It might be a little softer if poured thin. Even hard it was easy to carve with an exacto knife.I've worked with a lot of art material and this stuff is fun to work with.",5
B07V5FFPWC,Did what it was supposed to.  Got it on time.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I mixed it well (unlike- I think, some others who left bad reviews and said it was still sticky after days), and it looked great after 24 hours, but I used resin tape to keep my pieces in place and the sticky residue from the tape adhered to the surface of the cured piece.  I had to look up how to safely remove the tape residue without damaging the mold (because it was great, otherwise).  There's not much on how to remove that residue, or it's contradictory (rubbing alcohol, cider, you name it-- it all has elements that can damage the mold), so I'm going to have to do it again and maybe use hot glue to keep the pieces down. I gave this 4 stars on the off chance that it's the resin tape that I used and not the silicone. So just a word of caution...",4
B07V5FFPWC,"First I should say this is the only mold making silicone I have tried out. I am generally quite happy with Let's Resin products so had just a little higher hopes for it. It was very easy to use and the instructions were good. My first attempt was a disaster but my fault, I tried using a plastic container that would not release the mold once it had cured and ended up having to break apart the container to get the mold out and the mold was damaged in the process. Solved that problem very nicely though and my second attempt was perfect in that respect. My complaint is the bubbles. I tried everything and it is impossible to get rid of the bubbles and I'm talking lots of bubbles. The bubbles have not interfered with the casting itself so far, but holding the cured mold up to the light and it's nothing but bubbles all the way through. One of my blanks was an agate cabochon that had some crazing/veings running through it, you couldn't feel the lines but you could see the lines and the finished mold actually picked up the crazing pattern and transferred it to my casting. So it does pick up details very well.",4
B07V5FFPWC,"Going through all the reviews before I bought, I seen that several people had issues with curing. I can almost 100% say everyone that had issues with curing didn't properly stir it.That being said I half way read the instructions, mixed both entire bottles together, stirred for 5 minutes while scraping the sides and bottom, dumped it all in one cup to make a candle mold;  then in about 24 hours I have a perfect mold.  I did place the mold in the coldest part of my house that was about 65 degrees to slow down the curing a little bit and have absolutely 0 bubbles.In summary, with any epoxy, silicone, paint, etc. Stir it until your arm hurts, then switch hands and stir it until that arm hurts and repeat for at least 4-5 minute.  99% of failures with these items are people not properly stirring or they ad other chemicals that change the chemistry of the solution.This is a great product at a reasonable price",5
B07V5FFPWC,"I used this to make a mold for miniatures, so fine detail is important. The translucent nature made it easy to see what was covered in making the mold, and if anything was stuck on (or not) when using it. It seemed to release from the master pattern I used to make the mold more easilly than other silicone products I used, and the same for demolding the final product.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"Worked great, resulting in a  strong, clear and flexible mold.  Just follow the instructions properly and be as patient as required.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"Haven't worked with it yet but it looks very user friendly.  Since both parts are clear I got some mica powder to put with one of the parts to give it some color.  Looking forward to the end result, will have to update.  Excellent price, I got two!",5
B07V5FFPWC,Using this to make custom molds for wax melts and it worked perfectly! Only had to use a tiny bit so I should be able to make a ton more just from these two little bottles. Popped the mold in the fridge for an hour and removed it for the remaining three hours. Perfectly solidified with no bubbles!,5
B07V5FFPWC,First time working with silicone or resin. So easy. My pieces turned out great! I got some silicone color added to it and wow amazing,5
B07V5FFPWC,Have had no issues. Works like it should.,5
B07V5FFPWC,I mixed it per the instructions 50-50 and it never cured maybe I just got a bad batch,4
B07V5FFPWC,"I had a lot of fear going into this project. I had to buy the framing to make the mold. I expected it to be hard to mold, intolerable odor, and just all the worst case scenarios when dealing with chemical compounds.It was very easy to do. The instructions are fool proof and if you watch some YouTube videos, you get some tips and shortcuts",5
B07V5FFPWC,"I have used this product over and over again, ordered it multiple times. It sets up quickly, with no bubbles, details are always crisp and the molds last forever.One single time i had a box that i opened that wouldn't set up no matter what. I contacted the company and they responded within an hour and the next day sent me a replacement. I felt valued as a customer and they have earned my loyalty.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"when I'm 80 years old in a nursing home and the carers respond to the beeping alarms at 2AM, it'll likely be because I had another horrible flashback in my insomniac state back to my 30s when I thought ""let's try MAKING a silicone mold!"" and started out, for once, with an idea and gloves and equipment and y'all. I was actually prepared like one of those responsible people you hear about.But it was all a lie. there were no instructions in my box. that should have been the red flag. it should have told me ""b.... don't do it. you'll ugly-cry."" but nope. because I wanted to make pretty shuttles. and deities know nobody can change my mind. But I went and found a walkthrough from The Youtube from a resin artist who was using the same stuff WHO HAD INSTRUCTIONS (I feel betrayed). And followed along.The pouring and the mixing was... okay? Until it wasn't. My mold containment unit (I prefer the other MCU with the eye candy...) failed. There was silicone leaking everywhere. my phone was nearly a victim. my coffee mug was. (judge me) it was pouring off of the table onto my floor. it was headed for my laptop. and my tablet. on opposite ends of the table. i dove for both the tablet and my laptop. floor bedamned. clothing bedamned.i eventually got it all cleaned up and managed to salvage the remainder of the mixed silicone. just enough to pour over the smaller of the shuttles I would try to cast. it took all week to set. ALL WEEK. and then, it was hard as a silicone covered rock. freaky. I had the hardest time getting it open to see how it worked out. it eventually involved a box cutter. And after all of that, the mold was a flop. AND the silicone broke the center post of shuttle. it broke solid acrylic. the betrayal and heartache.it's been an entire week and there is still silicone in the tile grouting. I have cloroxed and scrubbed my workspace repeatedly and still find weird sticky film spots of silicone.one day, my future nursing home staff will loathe this purchase as much as I.this has been a review from Once Upon a Time, I Read a Book. because once upon a time, I did just read books... hahahave a good day and stay safe.",1
B07V5FFPWC,Always have a good experience with LET'S RESIN,5
B07V5FFPWC,it works great my first time trying this,5
B07V5FFPWC,"After 24 hrs it hadn't quite cured yet, but finished shortly after. Easy to use and relatively odor free.",4
B07V5FFPWC,"I used this to make molds for dice and it worked great! I followed the directions and stuck the molds in the fridge for 30-60 min after pouring and have not had any problems with bubbles so far. This is great because I don't have a pressure pot or vacuum chamber. After coming out of the fridge I usually left them to cure for at least 12 hrs and that seemed to be enough. I use Scotch packing tape, PVC pipe couplings, and hot glue to make my mold housing.Pro-tip: Make sure you learn what cure inhibition is and what causes it, and don't try to make molds of things that are going to react with this platinum-cure silicone (unless you coat it with something like Inhibit X first). I recommend doing a patch test on your master before pouring the whole mold to make sure it'll work.",5
B07V5FFPWC,I ordered this to make d&d dice molds and i had no issues with the silicone setting you just have to mix it properly. there are little to no air bubbles in the molds i made. I recommend mixing it for the 5 mins that it tells you to and then tapping your cup lightly against a hard surface to bring the bubbles up. After that i let it sit for about 3-4mins to let the bubbles float up and pop and then i poured the mixture into my mold setup. Personally i think this is a great affordable option to start out with for mold making when it comes to resin.,5
B07V5FFPWC,I have used other liquid silicone and none of them turned out THIS nice. It cured in only an hour. Others of the same thickness took 24 hours. This silicone is more solid and more sturdy. I am definitely buying this again.,5
B07V5FFPWC,This is so easy to use 1 to 1 ratio stir and pour. You can see thru your mold. Stretchy . Will purchase again! Let's resin products are one of the best I've tried!,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I used this to cast custom knife handles.  It was as easy as making a cardboard box, suspending the handle blank inside, mixing the silicone and pouring it in. I've made dozens of custom cast knife handles, I'll be able to use the same molds for years.  Item shipped promptly, I purchased more than once from the same seller and will again when I have a new handle model to cast.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"Used this to make a plastic worm mold, it took longer to dry completely than what the bottle states no big deal worked perfect to make the mold I wanted",5
B07V5FFPWC,The product was just as described,5
B07V5FFPWC,I've wanted to make my own silicone molds for a long time but was kind of afraid to try because I thought it would be really hard. This makes it really easy. I mixed the two parts according to the instructions and I used the bottom of a milk carton as my mold. I love that it's translucent so I can make molds for UV resin. Highly recommend this product for ease of use and cost of the product.,5
B07V5FFPWC,I never done did made a mold of somefin before and this was super easy to use. For sure get a scale though. Makes things a lot easier.,5
B07V5FFPWC,Great product! I use it to make picky pads to deter skin picking and nail biting,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I've been using this kit to make custom sound dampening material and plate dampening for mechanical keyboards and it works great! This silicone is very easy to work with and very forgiving if you mess up. Overall, this is a great kit for a wide variety of different projects and I am glad I bought it.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"I really like the quality, sturdiness and flexibility of the silicone molds that this product makes. I already made several silicone molds that I use for my candle business and they come out perfect. I wish they had larger bottles since I can only make like two molds out of it and I ordered it more than once. I do recommend this product.",5
B07V5FFPWC,Works great every time.  No bubbles.  I use colorizer sometimes and it does not affect curing.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"Ordered 3 times and they worked great! On my 4th order, it became a nightmare. Used half of the bottles on multiple mold cases, but none cured. Not even the mixing cups cured. My guess is that the bottles were mislabeled and gave my either two of part a or b bottles. Cleaning my models from sticky silicone was just a waste of my time and a disappointment",3
B07V5FFPWC,Follow the instructions and nothing happen,2
B07V5FFPWC,I used these to make some dnd dice sets and they came out so fresh and clean y'all. There was bubbles but the didnt interfere with my dice. They mostly popped up top. This thing is strong too. Really had to hold it open to pop my dice out. I used the whole bottle and it fit all 7-1.8 oz cups with plenty of left over so I made more molds real quick. Pour slow and and up at an angle so a fine drip line comes out so it can catch all those details you want. I also saw that if you put you fresh mold in the freeze it slows the hardening process to get more bubbles out. It says wait 12 hrs. I got inpatient and took them out at 7hrs and they came out just fine. I recommend sticking to the 12hrs however. It could just be that I live in Florida and it's been hot and dry lately.This review is not letting my post pics with my review but I am thoroughly happy with the product and will be purchasing again.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My experience with this product has left me disappointed and annoyed.They also have not answered my email.Despite following the provided instructions to the letter, the silicone never cured. Even after allowing the recommended curing time (plus an extra day) 48 hours later the silicone is still liquid and I have a HUGE mess to clean up. (not only did my silicone fail, but so did the seal on my borders for my inlays making the mess even worse)Additionally, another customer shared a similar experience in their review. We speculate that our troubles may be due to receiving mislabeled bottles, leading to incorrect proportions or compromised product quality. (I think mine was purchased the same time as theirs given the date of their review)As a consumer, I must admit feeling deeply disappointed by this outcome. Not only did the mold making kit fail to deliver on its promise, but it also resulted in unnecessary hassle and cleanup on my part.Im sad that this was my experience the first time using Lets Resin. While I understand that mishaps can occur, especially with complex products like these, I had hoped for a smoother and more successful experience. Moving forward, I would urge the manufacturer to address any quality control issues to prevent future disappointments for customers like myself.and if you do buy it, TEST IT FIRST!!!",1
B07V5FFPWC,"Straight forward instructions, so easily made the item and the result was great.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"So I'll start by saying it seems to be working well now, but it took me a while to get there.Turns out I was running into a silicone cure inhibition problem, where the silicone was reacting poorly to different materials I was using,Such as the mold release, spray paint, clear coats, tape adhesives, resins, ect.So after figuring out what materials do and don't work, it seems to be working quite well now",5
B07V5FFPWC,As described. Wonderful service,5
B07V5FFPWC,"Measured by weight using digital scale to hundredth of a gram. Mixed thoroughly, scraping sides and bottom. Poured over master, using their mold frame set, on a PVC mat, approx 1 inch deep. Next day (25 hours later) top (flat side that will be the bottom) of mold is beautifully set, but bottom of mold (where the resin will pour into) is still gooey. Removed 2 pieces of frame from each side, and left to sit. 48 hours after that, so 73 total hours, bottom still gooey. 11 hours more, so we flipped it over. 24 more hours, 1/16th ish of an inch of goo on top, not showing any signs of setting. Not just tacky, but very gooey.It's my first solo mold pour, so there may have been user error, but I don't think so. Not sure what to do now... or whether I have to scrap it all.",3
B07V5FFPWC,Worked great for my daughters craft project.  Definitely will be buying again.,5
B07V5FFPWC,I love this product and this brand. It's super easy to use. I used by volume rather than weight and it still worked. You can add color to it or leave it clear. It is super sticky when it cures though and it will show fingerprints.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"I experimented with my first mold making. This is a good, and inexpensive kit to start with. The durometer may be too low for certain parts to be molded effectively.",5
B07V5FFPWC,"Mix it, and leave it how could you go wrong",5
B07V5FFPWC,Easy to use to create things. Set up is easy.,5
B07V5FFPWC,Followed the instructions perfectly.  Poured the thoroughly mixed (time it for 2 minutes as both a and b are same color) silicone over my item in a small square 1 cup glass dish. (2 tbs A and 2 tbs B into small metal cup). Then covered and refrigerated for 1 hour. Removed from frig set out uncovered room temperature overnight. Came out without any bubbles at all and ran a small blade around edge before gently prying up one corner and using my fingers the rest.  Detailed beautifully. Thanks.,5
B07V5FFPWC,Worked well and very quickly.,5
B07V5FFPWC,"Going to start this off with the fact I've never made a mold or even used silicone before this. That said it was a super easy process, the instructions were very clear and it didn't even take very long for the molds to set. Also they came out very clear and crisp, no bubbles, no trouble removing it from the plastic container it had set in, or anything.I ordered this product to make my own D&D dice molds. This particular kit made enough to make 2 molds for 2 full sets of dice plus a smaller mold of misc stuff since I had a bit of extra silicone. I've already made a set to test the molds and am surprised how clean the edges are and how clear the numbers came out.So yeah, overall it's fantastic. Definitely would use it again, and I highly reccomend it. As long as you follow the instructions, should be pretty easy.  Just make sure to mix and set the silicone in something plastic so it doesn't stick!",5
B07V5FFPWC,"If you are thinking about saving a few bucks by buying this silicone molding kit, just don't.  I needed some for a project and was hoping to save some money, but instead I am out $30 and everything is a sloppy mess days later.  Even following the directions doesn't result in a good mold.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1
B07V5FFPWC,It made pretty decent negative molds for me. Could be a little more elastic to make it easier to pop out resin but that's just my preference.,4
B001KVMNPI,"For years I was using a specific brand of 'removable' velcro strips to hang pictures in my home. They worked great for most things, but after having a few heavier items fall off the wall and actually remove a layer of the wall itself I knew I needed something better to hang up some very important photos and canvases that I'd received recently.In my search I found these Monkey Hooks and they looked interesting. While I wasn't the biggest fan of making holes in my walls, I felt it was a fair trade-off for being able to securely attach things and not have damage later when I wanted to move something or it decided to move itself.I'm very happy with these.  The holes they make are small but the hooks definitely seem to be sturdy.  I was able to hang up a large canvas print with a homemade frame in mere minutes and it's not budging. No tools were needed other than the step ladder to get my short body up high enough to insert the hooks.I'm not totally sure what the little plastic pieces are for, as the instructions on how to use them were vague but it turned out I didn't need them.  Just push the pointy end of the hook into the wall, twisting a bit as you go then once it pops though, spin the entire thing around so the hook faces up.  You'll give it a small tug to get it ""seated"" into place and then hang whatever you want.These will definitely be something I keep on hand for future projects and highly recommend for anyone with either painted or 'papered' sheetrock and wallboard.  Mobile home walls are kind of a thinner version of sheetrock with a wallpaper type coating on the outside and these work perfectly for those.",5
B001KVMNPI,Ordered these to hang a mirror for my daughter. She has the tendency to want to change things around in her room and these hooks caught my eye. They are well designed and easy to use. No tools needed. The little plastic install guides are helpful in keeping the hole straight but is not required. They are removable and reusable which serves our purpose well. They are low impact and creat a small hole that is easier to patch than some of the screw in or hammer in type wall anchors. Would recommend!!!,5

B001KVMNPI,"Monkey Hooks do what they say, and they work well.  It certainly is very easy to work with them.  No hammer or other special tools needed.  Just pierce into the drywall, spin it over, and push it in.  They work as advertised, and are great for hanging pictures, signs, mirrors, etc.That being said, there are some quirks that can be issues for some people.  As pointed out by some other reviewers, there are some spots on your wall where you just simply can't use them.  They work by piercing through and being supported by the drywall itself, so if there is a stud behind the wall in the spot where you want to hang something, you simply can't use them there.I was recently using them to hang signs and mirrors in my basement, and also ran into problems using them too close to the ceiling.  That is another quirk.  My basement has a low ceiling, and I was hanging some signs high on the wall, near the ceiling.  The Monkey Hooks require room to spin over inside the wall, and I was not able to use them here either.In the spots where you can use them, though, they are great and are a real time saver.  I certainly prefer them to a hammer and nail, where I can use them.  I would recommended them, just know that they can't replace a hammer and nail 100% of the time.",4
B001KVMNPI,These are the best and super easy to use.  I hate trying to find a stud.  No longer an issue with these babies.  No need for a expandable screw.  These do the job.  I had a spot where there was  a heating duct behind the wall.  The way these go in it curves up and I was able to hang a mirror where otherwise I could not get the nail to go in deep enough to hold up the mirror.  If you have a stud you don't need this but that rarely happens with me.,5
B001KVMNPI,Minimal holes in your walls,5
B001KVMNPI,These are the best. Made putting up wall decorations much more easy. Would definitely recommend them.,5
B001KVMNPI,As advertised,5
B001KVMNPI,Hang away works well,5
B001KVMNPI,These are wonderful for drywall.  They are strong and make a very small hole in your wall.  I recommend the low profile hooks for most picture hanging though.,5
B001KVMNPI,These hooks work for everything,5
B001KVMNPI,Bought this for a friend and she loves them,5
B001KVMNPI,You have to be sure of where your framing in the wall is. Hook ends don't work with all types of picture hangers either. Not really worth the money,3
B001KVMNPI,These little suckers make hanging pictures and larger canvases SO easy!,5
B001KVMNPI,Save time.  No tools required.  Hanging pictures like a mad man!Got creative and did a collage using old wooden tennis rackets and mostly these Gorilla Hooks. Only wish I had discovered these sooner in my homeowning life.Highly recommend!,5
B001KVMNPI,I needed the heavy duty ones to hang a full size framed mirror. Works great,5
B001KVMNPI,What a great idea!,5
B001KVMNPI,My wife wanted to hang decorative plates. I didn't want a lot of damage to the drywall to fix later. I installed the plates using Monkey hooks and love that we only have holes the size of wire that can easily be repaired when she changes her mind for this area.,5
B001KVMNPI,"For something so simple looking, this is truly magical.  No more cursing, hitting my thumb with the hammer (or even needing a hammer),  getting things PERFECTLY straight the first time or leaving craters in my walls.  One hook is plenty for most pictures.  Heavier items (mirrors, decor, decorative cabinets etc) that need two hooks are simple too.  I put a piece of frog tape on the wall where I want to install the hooks and use a level to get top of tape level.  Then put the first hook in the wall lined up with the top of tape.  Don't worry you can do it!,  just push the hook straight through the drywall trying not to jiggle too much.  Then measure the distance between the hangers (center to center) and then measure from the center of the first hook and put the next hook at the correct distance.  Perfect every time.  This is just the way I did it but I am sure there are many other ways.  When you want to remove them there is a very small hole to fill.",5
B001KVMNPI,These things work so well. They barely leave a hole and hold really well.,5
B001KVMNPI,"The monkey hooks worked fine, but it took an act of Congress and you know what Congress is like today, to get them apart and out of the plastic and sticky tape that they were encompassed in",4
B001KVMNPI,Good product,5
B001KVMNPI,They work great. The only time you have a concern is when there is a stud behind the insertion point.  You have to move the hole over.,5
B001KVMNPI,Work great and lots of them,4
B001KVMNPI,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These hooks are amazing!  Easy to use, inexpensive, hold a TON of weight for heavy mirrors and other decor, and only leave a small hole if you decide to move your wall decor. So much better than using an anchor!",5
B001KVMNPI,I love the hooks and specifically sought them out. So easy to use to hang things without needing tools and they're very sturdy. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the packaging is different than shown/how it used to be and is not as convenient in my opinion.,4
B001KVMNPI,"I love these things.  They make hanging a picture so easy.  I am one who used to hate hanging pictures.  When my wife would ask me to hang a picture, I would have to go get my stud finder, hammer, nails, screwdriver, screws, wall anchors, level, tape measure and the list goes on.  Invariably, my stud finder needed batteries or didn't work or wasn't accurate.  It was an ordeal and a frustration to hang a picture.Now, with Monkey Hooks, I hold the picture up until she is happy with the location, take the picture away and push a Monkey Hook into the wall.  If there is a stud, the Monkey Hook won't go into the wall and I get a screw and hang the picture.  If there is no stud, the hook goes in an makes a hole no bigger than a small nail - no wall anchors needed.  It literally takes me less than 60 seconds to hang a picture now.  This is quite important for me, as I have adult daughters that have moved into their own apartments and want dear old dad to hang all of the pictures and do dads on the walls for them.  I have bought them each a pack of these so I can use them when I go to their places to hang things.I've also introduced friend to these.  They have told me many times that they would not have believed how easy it was until I bought them some and brought them to their house and showed them how to use them.  They had just painted their walls and had taken all of the pictures down and patched the holes.  They were able to go back with these hooks to minimize the damage AND the frustration of hanging the pictures again.Would highly recommend and will continue to purchase and spread the word to others.",5
B001KVMNPI,These hooks have become the only hooks I use now.,5
B001KVMNPI,"These Monkey Hooks are just an incredible invention - I only wish I knew about them many years ago. They are working great - hung a LOT of museum quality photography frames in our new place. There are a lot of similar looking products out there, but this review is specific to the Original product specifically called Monkey Hook on the packaging. So I cannot vouch for those.I've used all three different types available - Flush Mount (can hold 10-15 lbs), Original Monkey Hook (can hold 20 - 35 lbs) and Gorilla Grade (can hold 40-70 lbs). The easiest way to install them is to get a nail that is the same size in diameter as the hook wire, make a hole with the nail using hammer, and then insert the hook. Using the hook itself to make/pierce the hole is not very comfortable, requires a lot of pressure and you can bend the hook doing this. The heaviest piece I've hung so far was a 6 foot long by 1 foot wide 10mm thick acrylic art piece that weighs about 25 lbs (but it feels so much heavier!). I used two Gorilla Grade hooks (just in case) and so far (1 month later) it's holding up just fine. I've seen some reviews that say if you hang anything that is very light it will not work - that is not my experience. If you CORRECTLY insert the hook, the physics (of the design) will take over and you can hang very light frames on it.",5
B001KVMNPI,"I wanted to hang a few pictures that were past the weight for most nails and too light to be worth working with a stud. These hold them well, were easy to install, and have minimum damage to the wall.Not a replacement for a stud for heavier objects in my opinion, even if using the heavy duty ones. Use a stud when possible for anything heavy, bottom line.",5
B001KVMNPI,Easy to use and leaves super small hole if you move the item you're hanging.,5
B001KVMNPI,These hooks are easy to use and make picture hanging so easy.,5
B001KVMNPI,"Tried an assortment of hanging hooks from home depot, all were ugly and bulky and left sticky residue or big holes behind. My friend said he heard about these and i found them on amazon. I used about 15 hooks to hang a hunch of stuff in my new apartment and i have had no issues at all with them. Easy to push through the dry wall, and i have stuff hanging that weigh about 10lbs and the hooks are doing just what theyre supposed to do. Had to move something i hung and the hoke is so small i just filled it with a bit of elmers glue, taped over it, and after it dried i used nail polish that matched the wall color and i cant see where the hole was at all. Great product, i will definitely be buying again",5
B001KVMNPI,"For most hanging needs in Sheetrock, these work GREAT. I suggest you have/borrow a stud sensor FIRST to locate where the stud is behind the wallboard, and if stud is close to your install point, to know the studs right or left side from its center. That way you can avoid unnecessary holes & or offsets of the item hung from its intended spot. Of course if it is a stud, you just change the fastener to  accommodate for that.When you twist the hook and break through the wall, rotate to its intended curve path and then wiggle & push (letting it slide vs grind through)until seated to the hook. If you encounter insulation behind the wall, you will need to feel & wiggle hook a bit more. If blanket fiberglass type, it will either poke through the paper or curl under it but still seat. If loose fill, again more wiggles but seat ok as you move through the dense material. If you encounter a rare foam fill situation, you should switch to an appropriate wall anchor because the wiggle time to grind away foam and not ruin the hole size in the process may not be worth it! But, it has been done it you have patience!RH",5
B001KVMNPI,There were different size hooks for different size pictures.  Met our need completely,5
B001KVMNPI,These are way better to use when hanging heavy objects or objects that are used often. I know I will be buying more in the future. I love them!!,5
B001KVMNPI,So easy to pierce the wall and hang a picture. I don't always have a hammer and nail and we have lathe and plaster walls. These are great! When I use a nail it ends up falling out of the wall. I have dime-sized holes in walls from nails falling out over the years. Wish I would have found these 20 years ago.,5
B001KVMNPI,"These are so great! Easy to use, holds heavy pictures and wall hangings secure with one hook. So much better than tearing up your walls with screws or multiple holes.Easily recommend them for all your indoor/dry wall hangings.",5
B001KVMNPI,Just push and hang.,5
B001KVMNPI,The small and medium are similar to the original brand (no longer available) that i had gotten over 15 years ago and are easily used like other brand. However after priming the drywall with a screw and spending over 5 minutes the large one is still not installed and unfortunately the hole I created trying to wiggle it in is unsightly. I will not order the large ones again. The smaller one went right in.,3
B001KVMNPI,"I love these things...they are so easy to use.  I have hung pictures, shelves, baskets, cork boards...you name it.  My one and only issue is that I need a stud finder because I have a habit of just trying to put them anywhere and have obtained a few holes in my walls where there is a stud.  This is 1000% user error.  This is the 2nd time I have ordered this multi pack and I am sure I will order again.",5
B001KVMNPI,"Best thing I've found for hanging stuff on drywall. Easy, fast installation. Can hold a lot of weight. And removal of the hook leaves only a tiny hole. What's not to love.",5
B001KVMNPI,Just what I needed,5
B001KVMNPI,Love,5
B001KVMNPI,A bit pricey,4
B001KVMNPI,Finally a product that actually works in drywall without making a big hole and then falling out!!!  Love these,5
B001KVMNPI,These are excellent!!!,5
B001KVMNPI,"I had my 100lb mirror up on my wall using the As Seen on TV Hercules Hooks I bought over 15 to 20 years ago. Recently, I had to take down my mirror due to a roof leak and in that process bent those hooks deeming them unusable. I tried to look for those hooks again and couldn't find any, that is until I walked across these gorilla hooks at Home Depot. These were cheaper on Amazon, so I bought these on here. The gorilla hooks are much wider in width than the Hercules I was using and look and feels to be much stronger. They have been holding up my mirror very well, and I only used 2 hooks.Hope my review helps!",5
B001KVMNPI,"The hooks penetrate sheetrock easily making only a small hole.  Once they are in place, they are very sturdy.  This variety pack has sizes to accommodate three different weights of items that need to be hung on sheetrock.  Highly recommended and the price is very good compared to buying in stores.",5
B001KVMNPI,I absolutely love Monkey hooks.  I keep them on hand and use them as much as possible instead of a hammer and nails.  They are so easy to use and hold things in place so well.  I highly recommend Monkey Hooks to everyone!,5
B001KVMNPI,"I really like the simplicity that Monkey Hooks provide when hanging items throughout the house. Installation is simple enough; pick a spot, pierce the sheetrock with pointed end, invert so hook is facing upright and hang your item. In an ideal environment it's just that easy, but of course we don't always have an ideal environment available.Plyers and wire cutters...I wish this was a pack of 30 flush mount. The heavy duty hooks are overkill for most applications but are still usable as are the standard hooks, but with each they may leave your picture frame, art, or whatever you are hanging visibly protruding off the wall. In such a case you can minimize this effect by gently squeezing the hook end with a pair of plyers, or cut back the hook (not the pointed end) to minimize this effect.In case of studs...If you happen to find a stud with your hook all is not lost. The bad news is you will not be able to use your hook at this position; the good news is you can use a small nail securely anchored in the stud in it's place . If you don't have a hammer, are not comfortable using one or have some flexibility in where you wish to place your hanger, a stud is only 1 1/2"" wide, so an an 1 1/2"" in either direction should be sufficient clearance for use.Overall I think the Monkey Hook is a fantastic alternative to the more traditional sheet rock anchors and can allow you to quickly meet your hanging needs.",5
B001KVMNPI,I despise having to nail things into the wall and use anchors for drywall. These are amazing for hanging pictures and items on my wall. I love this pack because there are different sizes that fit my hanging needs. Literally eveything on my wall is hung with these.,5
B001KVMNPI,Great product,5
B001KVMNPI,"These are the easiest things to use in hanging pictures, etc.. They are also great when getting ready to use a hollow wall hanger and you want to see if you are going to be running into a wall stud.",5
B001KVMNPI,"Probably the best way to hang pictures, assuming your intended wall is what these were designed for - namely drywall with empty space behind it.  If there is a stud or other solid object within 3"" behind your drywall, you'll need a more conventional hanger.These leave a hole about the same size a small nail does, but no tools are required to put them in and they are VERY secure and will support heavier pictures (use 2 or more for very heavy frames).The ""flush mount"" hooks only stick out about 1/4"" from the wall and you get 10 of those.  Save them for the items you really want to hug close to the wall.I recommend you get a stud finder to make sure you choose a good spot to stick these in.  I usually run the stud finder around and make pencil marks where the studs are and then choose where to hang pictures.I have several large heavy frames and even a heavy ironwood didjeridoo hung using these.  I've been using them for years and never had a problem.NOTE:  If you are trying to be really precise lining up your frames (I usually am), then measure the distance from the bottom of the hook to the spot where it will stick out from the wall.  The bottom of the hook is usually about 1/4"" below the hole in the wall, so aim high by that much when putting the hook into the wall and you'll be right on.",5
B001KVMNPI,"I had heard of these for years, but I finally thought to try them. They are so great!!!!  I have had no problem with anything I have used them for.... definitely something I will always try to keep on hand.",5
B001KVMNPI,"One of the best items ever ! Easy to use, holds  items securely and does no damage to walls.",5
B001KVMNPI,Easy to use.  Takes a little muscle power but requires no tools and makes a very small hole.  No damage to the wall and all my pictures are up!,5
B001KVMNPI,"""Residents are not allowed to drive nails in the blah blah blah."" Whatever. Eat me, pops.Use these if you rent. They work well, and are easy to 'install:' You just twist them into the drywall, hang up that ugly thing you bought at the local coffee shop, and let gravity do its thing.When you move out because they went up $300/month and your state doesn't care if you have a roof, get a little can of patch repair down at Ace, smush it in the little hole, and scrape it flat with one of those losing scratchers all over your floorboards. Painters won't care, and your landlord's an idiot.",4
B001KVMNPI,I am so pleased with this product. No more large holes in the wall. Great value and easy to install. Wish I would have found out about these years ago!,5
B001KVMNPI,"Pros...these are a god send, as they allow you to have a very secure hook in the wall that can hold very heavy items.  They are reusable, not like those sticker ones.  They don't leave too much of a big hole compared to a push pin and they provide more security and stability.  I also love that this kit comes with different types of monkey hooks for different uses.  One is nice for smaller holed things that you want close to the wall.  They the other two types are good for larger and heavier objects which sit farther from the wall.cons...still leaves a hole in the wall, it is slightly larger in diameter compared to a push pin, but the security of it not coming off the wall is worth it.  I used to use push pins to keep some clocks on the wall and when I have to replace the batteries, the push pin is slightly loosened and eventually falls out or starts to angle downwards.  Either way the push pin starts to loose stability and eventually will not work to keep the clocks on the wall.",5
B001KVMNPI,Just know if there are any studs behind the wall before you go making holes.,5
B001KVMNPI,These are so easy to use and are great for hanging heavy pictures or mirrors.,5
B001KVMNPI,"Very easy to use and no big holes in wall.  However i was hanging a 3 piece wall art and after alot of time measuring one was 1/4 "" higher.  You have to make sure you use ones that are identical.  They have small (1/8"") differences.  It's also variable because you push and twist so it slightly bends the hook.  So please pay attention to shape and size if using for pieces you want exactly same height.  For single hanging, 5 stars.  Just wish someone would have given me a heads up",4
B001KVMNPI,"I had purchased a wall hanging that I just loved.  I was aware that it weighed 5 pounds, as stated in the description.  But, when it arrived I realized that it weighed well over 5 pounds and it was more than I could handle, there was no way I could hang this on the wall, even if I did find a hanger that would hold its weight.  I would still have to hold the wall hanging up there long enough to move it around to find the hook and then to get the wall hanging to settle on the hook when I was finally able to locate it.I was about to return the wall hanging when I read a review about Monkey Hooks and in particular about the Gorilla Grade hanger.  The video that I watched made it look so simple.  I was hesitant, but moved forward due to the great review and I am so thankful that I did.  The installation was just as easy as shown and the Gorilla Grade hanger is holding my wall hanging with ease.Thank you Monkey Hook and thank you to the person who took the time to leave the review...",5
B001KVMNPI,Work as advertised,5
B001KVMNPI,"I love monkey hooks, use them for hanging everything up from pictures to other art objects, so the key holder by the door, EVERYTHING! they are so easy to use and require no tools, just push and twist and 10 seconds later you've got stuff up on the walls.",5
B001KVMNPI,These are the only way I hang things on my walls. These little hooks are so amazing and easy to use.,5
B001KVMNPI,Works really well with really heavy items as well!,5
B001KVMNPI,Easy to use.  Convenient and sturdy,5
B001KVMNPI,Easy to use and only make a small hole in the wall. Sometimes they don't catch properly and will wiggle from side to side but I still hung a light weight picture and so far had no problems. I wouldn't try hanging a heavier picture or mirror on one that didn't catch properly. I'm not sure if it's the product or my wall because I've used these to hang a few pictures and a mirror and it's random when they don't catch behind the wall properly. All in all I'd recommend these and will buy them again.,4
B001KVMNPI,"I bought this pack almost entirely for the flush mount hooks. In theory, it makes sense that a smaller hook would make artwork stick out less, which was what I was looking for. For some reason, this has not been the case with paintings I have hung. The flush mount has made no perceivable difference in how artwork hangs vs the standard Monkey Hook. I included photos of two types of paintings with different hanging methods to show what I mean. I dinged my star rating pretty significantly due to this because, again, I bought this pack specifically for the flush mount, and they literally do not make a difference.As far as how the hooks work in general, I am very pleased with them. They're very easy to install, and I love being able to center art on walls without regard for stud location. I find that taking the hooks out is a bit difficult, but when I use pliers to grip the hook, removing them is no problem. I have not tried anything crazy heavy, so I can't speak to how they work in that regard.",3
B001KVMNPI,They work exactly as advertised. I just bought my second package. Very simple to use.,5
B001KVMNPI,"Ordered these online because they include flush mount. Can't ever find flush mount in stores.  Flush mounts work well for small items and things you want hung closer to wall.I have used monkey hooks for years and never have any problems, unless I hit a stud, then I have to use nails.They hold well and are easily removable. Installing them is easy, just push thru sheetrock, adjust,  then push a touch more to tighten it.",5
B001KVMNPI,"I bought these on a whim, because I'd just moved into a house, and was shopping for some picture hanging materials.  These things are awesome! Easier to install than molly bolts, more secure than simple nails in drywall. I've used them for all of my wall hangings, and ended up ordering 2 more sets!  I may never use nails in drywall again unless there's a stud right where I want to hang something.",5
B001KVMNPI,"Have bought this before, they work great",4
B001KVMNPI,I received exactly what I ordered and they arrived on time. Great product!,5
B001KVMNPI,A friend had told me about Monkey Hooks.  They are so easy to use.  I'll never use anything else to hang my pictures!,5
B00009NDCX,"Excellent quality photo paper. It works amazingly with my Epson ET8500 printer.  The results are crisp and sharp, and the price is fair considering the quantity and quality offered.",5
B00009NDCX,"everything is good, print quality wise. it would have been perfect for my store. until i see the multiple ""EPSON"" watermark at the back part, which made it not suitable for business. Maybe for personal use its good quality and cheap, but definitely not for my business use.",4
B00009NDCX,"I found that using Epson premium paper to be the best, giving you vivid colors and smearless glossy prints. But there are caveats with all printers and especially Epson who uses a different...and more costly... print head that can cause printing problems IF YOU DO NOT UTILIZE GOOD MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES.I have an Epson EcoTank ET 4750, which I love and have had it for just over a year now.  One thing you need to do with inkjet type  printers, Epson especially, is to use you machine at least 2-3x a week....WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT. With Epson, in order to keep the print head nozzle from drying which can cause serious print issues...like vertical lines in you glossy pics, etc., you should make a couple  prints weekly to keep the print head nozzle from drying and potentially clogging the print head.  If you find you are not getting clear pics then you need to do a nozzle check and CLEAN the print heads and if is shows defects in the print test  then you MUST proceed to the head cleaning process.  Yes it does take a bunch of ink to do this but your pics will come out much more perfect if you follow this process.Other printers in the lower price range, like HP's, Canon, Lexmark, have the the print head in their cartridges so it is not as critical in keeping the print head nozzles from drying and clean as long as you're using them at least on a bi-weekly/monthly basis.  Every time you install a new cartridge you get a new print head/nozzle. Not keeping your Epson nozzles cleaned can clog them and you run into much bigger problems.Epson uses a more expensive ""Micro-Piezo"" print head which gives you more precise and vibrant pictures on all of their printers. So their cartridges, or in the case of their Ecotank units which uses bottles of ink, you get more vivid, bright and clearer pictures. I have yet to use all the ink, black or color since having this printer and when I do Epson has given me another complete set of ink with the initial printer purchase.  You can print thousands of prints for just a few pennies compared to other inkjet printers.  When you do run out, Epson can supply you with another set of black and color Ecotank bottles for far less than what I used to pay for my ink cartridges and you're off and running again for a very long time.  Just remember to use your printer frequently and you should be alright.Another thing causing inkjet printer issues is IMPROPER shut down procedures.  NEVER shut down your printer by shutting down say the power strip to which your printer is hooked up to or immediately hit the printer shut off button.  This sudden shutdown DOES NOT allow your printer to properly clear any extra ink on the nozzle and seals off the ink reservoirs, circumventing the short cleaning process programmed in your printer and which can cause additional printer print issues. Always allow your printer to do a normal shutdown procedure.",5
B00009NDCX,It delivers a beautiful result in photography.  It's worth investing in a larger print paper for cherished images.,5
B00009NDCX,"Borderless, glossy, high quality like you'd get from professional prints, and not too expensive. No complaints!",5
B00009NDCX,Love the convenience of ordering online and it arrives quickly! Quality product and price!,5
B00009NDCX,Got a Epson printer usually buy my photo paper at Best Buy but I happen to look in Amazon and found a better deal,5
B00009NDCX,Good,5
B00009NDCX,Good quality product,5
B00009NDCX,Product is perfect. Nice quality.,5
B00009NDCX,"4x6 prints well. Gloss,paper thickness, clarity",5
B00009NDCX,"Pretty good quality for the price, works perfectly with my Epson printer works better than kodak, it doesn't curl up, great weight not too thin not too thick,",4
B00009NDCX,"I ended up getting a new Epson printer and decided to buy this Epson Premium Photo Paper for printing my photos. Prior to this, I had an HP and used HP print paper so this is my review of the differences.The price is fair and similar to the HP paper I was buying previously. The photos look excellent (probably more of a testament to the printer). The photos haven't smudged or scratched at all, but I let mine dry for 24 hours before handling just to be safe. The box it comes in is excellent for storage and later use.My only minor complaint is that the back is difficult to write on. I like to write the date, location, and people in photos on the back of the picture itself which wasn't an issue with the HP paper I was using but it is an issue with this Epson paper. I've tried all kinds of writing utensils and nothing writes well without smudging so I've resorted to paper labels. This is probably just a me problem and no one else would care, but it annoys me.Overall, it's worked well for printing my photos so I'll give it 5 stars and I would recommend it for your Epson photo printing.Hope this helps!",5
B00009NDCX,"prints well, dries fast",4
B00009NDCX,"All of the corners on one side of the paper are damaged, so I can't use this for my prints.",4
B00009NDCX,"This paper is just the right weight for my purposes, and works great with my Epson Eco Tank 2800, I've purchased it a couple of times now and I will purchase it again when my supply runs out. The price on Amazon also beats the price in store by quite a bit.",5
B00009NDCX,Look really good but I returned because I was looking for regular size of paper,3
B00009NDCX,"I purchased this  Epson High-Gloss Premium Photo Paper (S042183)        , thinking that it is a new photo paper for me to try on my  Epson Stylus Photo RX620        printer. When it arrived, I was surprised to see this fine print on its package: ""Formerly Premium Glossy Photo Paper"".But all is fine. I have used the Epson Premium Glossy Paper since about 10 years ago when it first came out, on my old Epson Stylus Photo 1270 printer. It was the best photo paper available at the time, and it is still an excellent choice today for used with newer Epson printers. This is the paper that I always use to generate that ""WOW"" reaction when I show my prints to others.Here is what I liked about this paper:- It is extra thick with a glossy finish, which makes the printout looks and feels EXACTLY like a 'real' (dye-sub) photo.- It has a very high brightness index, when gives the printout greater contrast and more 'POP'.- With the correct printer and image settings, the printout is GORGEOUS - much better than prints you can get from any chain-stores.- Inks dry almost instantly on this paper, so there's no need to wait hours for the print to dry (unlike the case with  Epson Colorlife photo paper        ).- The print surface is _relatively_ tough (though not as tough as a 'real' photo) and is water-resistant. So handling the prints is much easier.One slight disadvantage of this photo paper is its print permanence. As with any inkjet printout, it should not be displayed in open air, or else fading due to ozone will occur. This was a serious problem with previous generation of dye-based inks. But with later-generation Epson 'Claria Hi-Definition' inks (used in my RX620, for example), the display life has improved significantly(*). So now I have no reservations in recommending this photo paper for use with newer Epson inkjet printers.(*) According to a report by Wilhelm Research Institute, the combination of Epson RX660 inks and this Premium Glossy photo paper gives a display life of 17 years when the print is exposed to open-air. If the print is framed behind glass, its display life increases to 98 years. When stored in a photo album, the print can last for over 200 years! But of course, those are all projected data.",5
B00009NDCX,Very good quality pictures on this type of Photo paper.,5
B00009NDCX,The paper prints really nice I used an HP inkjet printer to print photos for the kids and it came out beautifully will definitely buy again!,5
B00009NDCX,"I never knew there was a process for printing on this kind of paper. I followed the process and the image turned out awesome. The shine was superb for this advertisement sheet. This picture doesn't do it justice, but trust me it's great!",5
B00009NDCX,See headline.,4
B00009NDCX,"These worked beautifully with my new Epson printer. Excellent clarity and color. Just make sure you don't load them in the printer upside down like I did on my first try. I've had ink stains on my hands for days! Once I got it right, I was very pleased with the results.",5
B00009NDCX,"This 4 x 6 photo paper is excellent for most photos. The color is brilliant after printing. It's archive quality. It is good for everyday use. The thickness is good, and it doesn't smear. There is one higher quality for professional photos that are meant to last a lifetime.",5
B00009NDCX,I like the weight of the paper and it prints so nicely.,5
B00009NDCX,This the best paper to print pics off my computer.,5
B00009NDCX,Great paper quality. The pics comes out very colorful and glossy.,5
B00009NDCX,I had no smearing or color running with this product. The paper has a nice thickness to it. Over all Nice quality for the price . I will continue to use this product,5
B00009NDCX,"I was so excited to use these photo paper bc they were cheaper than HP photo paper. I was dead wrong. They wouldn't slide into the 4x6 slot of my HP Printer. They're all unevenly cut and I even measured them and found them to be 1mm too wide. I had to awkwardly trim them with my paper cutter. The blade is kind of dull for thick photo paper. I felt weird to return them bc I had already attempted to cut them. So I'm making due. But so disappointing how they're not exactly 4x6. I'm sticking back with HP photo paper now. Never had problems with them.Edit: Update:I reordered them and bought them while their in sale! They're cheaper than the everyday and advanced paper, so I bought 2. The packaging is slightly altered, so it makes me believe these were a different, maybe altered batch bc they actually fit in the photo paper tray of my HP Printer?! So I'm super happy about that. I think Epson paper quality is far better than HP! It's thicker and holds up very well! Will keep ordering despite the measurements can be off.",4
B00009NDCX,Product worked as advertised and the picture quality is nice.,4
B00009NDCX,This paper produces very good quality photos. It is a bit expensive compared to other name brand photo paper.,5
B00009NDCX,"This purchase as simply restocking; I've used this paper for years, and never been disappointed with it. The glossy finish is just what I want, color is vivid and it's instantly dry when it comes out of my Epson printer. This paper gets 5 stars from me.",5
B00009NDCX,Terrific photo paper at a great price,5
B00009NDCX,"Using an EPSON printer with this paper is just amazing. This paper is not only glossy, but has a bit of a pearl look to it as well, which is an extra cost item at any print shop. 9 cents per print is a steal. My family could not tell which photo I printed, and which one came from a local drug store print shop.I also compared 'standard' and 'high' print settings. Standard had slightly less depth of blue in the shadows of my test print....but otherwise the difference was negligible, but 'standard' is much faster.Caucasian skin tones fluoresced hints of pearl at certain viewing angles. (Personally I think that is a positive, but I can certainly see that as a drawback in many instances)I am looking forward to the family Christmas gathering in which I hope to capture everyone in attendance in an individual portrait, and then print in just minutes on site, as a bit of a personal gift to each and every person.",5
B00009NDCX,"Been very happily printing photos on my new (to me) EPSON EcoTank ET-8550... fantastic photo printer for prints up to 13x19!  The EPSON Premium Glossy paper provides great quality prints with great sharpness, color saturation, and texture of my photos. Will keep buying these.",5
B00009NDCX,"Very nice and photos print well. Of course it has more to do with your printer and ink, BUT all things considered, works great. Will buy again.",5
B00009NDCX,"Great quality, like everything else Epson does. My go-to for ALL our company's printers.",5
B00009NDCX,This photo paper works well for printing my photos at home.,5
B00009NDCX,basic photo paper. several size options. easy to use. good quality,5
B00009NDCX,I love the quality and  thicknessInk doesn't smearI use it on a Epson xp7100 and it works flawlessly  use it on my photo booth bussines,5
B00009NDCX,"Had to order 3 times before I was sent the size I ordered, but the picture does not print edge to edge like with name brand photo paper, so my suggestion is to order good the first time and spend a few extra pennies. It will be worth it.",4
B00009NDCX,This is the third box of this photo paper that I have used. Photos always seem to come out excellent.,5
B00009NDCX,You can get really great prints of a high resolution photo.  I have never had a problem with Epson paper or printers.,5
B00009NDCX,"I used this paper with the Epson Ecotank 8550 printer and love the prints it produces on this paper!  They are rich and vibrant and have accurate color. There is a color profile for this paper built into the printer, so it makes getting accurate prints very easy. The ink dries very quickly and you end up with a great glossy print.  Any good quality photo paper is a bit pricey, but this seems in line with other photo papers on the market.  I recommend this paper for use on this printer and will buy it again when needed.",5
B00009NDCX,Used this for my family pictures love to have extra so I am always ready to print,5
B00009NDCX,"A word on photo quality. Using a Epson Artisan printer with the correct paper will produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab. I highly recommend the Epson Photo papers as they are designed for the Epson inks and the Epson printers specifically. I tested the ""Epson Premium Photo Paper Glossy"" and ""Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy"" and recommend both. Looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible. The detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny. A few differences emerge under very careful observation:* The Ultra Premium Paper is slightly heavier paper, this adds to its stiffness. When picking up a 4x6"" photo from the 4"" edge there is about half as much bend vs the Premium Paper.* The Ultra Premium Paper has an ISO brightness of 96, versus 92 for the Premium Paper. This makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the Ultra Premium. Telling the difference in brightness requires good light, identical photos side by side, and far too much scrutiny.* The Premium costs about 12.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100* The Ultra Premium costs about 22.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100Given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double I'd recommend the Premium for every day use and the Ultra Premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket. Photos on the Premium paper will be better than you'd get at your local Walgreens or Costco.  Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy, 4 x 6, 100 Sheets (S042174)",5
B00009NDCX,Great prints. No complaints. Pictures were nice and clear,5
B00009NDCX,Worth it,5
B00009NDCX,"I really love this paper, the glossy and the satin and I tend to choose satin as they are more professional looking.I have several scrapbooks I am creating/created and have scanned in some old pictures that my mom will not depart with. I was able to touch up the photos in Lightroom/Photoshop, print them and place them in my scrapbooks. Treasured memories. I am pleased with the results. I am printing with the Epson XP-960, which is Claria dye inks and the pictures are lovely. Sure that with the higher end Epson printers that use pigment ink the photos will be lovelier. However, for my purpose they are just right.The prints are way better than what you would get at a big box store or pharmacy. They are on par with what you will get from a professional lab, consumer prints.Highly recommend.",4
B00009NDCX,"I have an Epson XP-15000 printer that I use for printing photos at home. I love that printing my own photos allows me to choose the size and I'm not limited to what the local photo lab charges me.  This paper prints beautiful photos (at high/best resolution), they don't fade (I realize some of that is the ink, too...which I also only use Epson).  The photos I printed several years ago on this paper look just as good as the ones I printed last week.  I purchased this paper due to the recommendation of Ali Edwards - and since she prints photos for  a living (for her scrapbooks), I feel like her recommendations carry a lot of weight.",5
B00009NDCX,"Paper prints acceptable full color images. However, the cardboard sleeve that the paper is packaged in was completely unzipped and open. This cannot happen by accident. Why would that be?",3
B00009NDCX,I purchased this photo paper to use with our eco-tank printer. I was planning to use it for an escape room birthday party that I had planned for my son. It required printing out a lot of full color activities and thematic decorations. I had never used photo paper with our eco-tank printer until this particular experience. The end result was phenomenal. The quality was amazing and it really made my sons party that much more exciting since the escape room game pieces looked so realistic. I am very pleased with the quality of this photo paper and will be using it in the future.,5
B00009NDCX,"Great weight and picture quality, however the prints come out littered with small, white specks all over. I may have gotten defective paper, which is disappointing considering the price",4
B00009NDCX,Works well for photos. Value is much better than the ultra gloss. Prints well. Comes out clear.,5
B00009NDCX,Clear printing and sharp lines for photos.  Excellent printer paper.,5
B00009NDCX,"No paper jams, no smudging, no disappointment. Worth every penny and more!",5
B00009NDCX,"Love this product but it was not packaged and it is raining, hot, and humid!  Left on front porch so box is  wet and paper is curved up. Trying to flatten now.  This is on Amazon!!",3
B00009NDCX,"Used this with an Epson Ecotank printer, got decent results with borderless printing.",5
B00009NDCX,"We had purchased lighter weight picture paper to use in our printer, but the printer just wrinkled them up and spit them out unprinted. We thought the printer was broken, but after putting the heavier weight paper in, it worked just fine!",5
B00009NDCX,"I already had an Epson Inkjet Printer but I had never used it to print photos. So far, I am very happy with the result and I think my grandma will be very happy to have physical photos again for her albums. It's very convenient, the pack was at a great price, and with 100 sheets, I think this will last me some time before I need to buy more. The photo sheet also arrived super-fast and two days earlier than expected (3 days in total). I also really appreciate it comes with instructions on how to print and how to take care of the paper so the photo doesn't get ruined. All in all, I'm super happy with this purchase.",5
B00009NDCX,Great paper for the price,5
B00009NDCX,This can to me as an open item also stock was curved do to oxidation.,4
B00009NDCX,This paper is just the right thickness for printing photos and the price is fair.,4
B00009NDCX,I print photos.,5
B00009NDCX,"So, we have the WF-7820, and setting aside all my complaints about that printer, it works really well with this paper. The quality is great, the printer has settings that recognize it and I have been very happy seeing our landscape photography come out of this. We've even used this, post print, in a cricut for foil stamping text onto the paper and it worked (cause you can't run photo paper through a laser printer to do heat gold foil embossing). So - a good combo.",5
B00009NDCX,"This is high quality paper for my Epson printer. Admittedly, the printer does well with almost any kind of decent paper, but I find this paper seems to produce really accurate colors.",5
B00009NDCX,Worked well,4
B00009NDCX,"This is a superior photo paper for my Epson printer.  I tried another brand, and found that the colors smeared even before the photo was finished printing.  Sticking with the Epson brand from now on!",5
B00009NDCX,I had to return one package of this product because it came opened and obviously missing sheets of paper. Got a second order and it also has the factory seal broken and has been obviously taken out of the factory package and returned.,2
B00009NDCX,Print quality is excellent.  Make sure you allow for ink drying time before placing in frames..,5

B00009NDCX,"I have an Epson ET-4760 that doesn't print the greatest on some brands of photo paper, but this Epson premium photo paper 4x6 turned out great! Saved me a trip to CVS - and way cheaper for the few photos I needed printed. Will definitely buy again. Also makes great look postcards to hand out for church events that look professionally printed. Price could be a little lower, but satisfied given prices right now and the cost of other photo paper, so it's not too bad.",5
B00009NDCX,This is very basic photo paper. It is durable & the colors show well. I like it.,5

B00009NDCX,I love the way it print the photo's out very good.,5
B00009NDCX,Late with Christmas cards so I made New Years cards. Quality of the paper was just like the ones from drug stores. Very Happy,5
B00009NDCX,I have used this many times and picture I have printed has been perfect. No bleed over or smears.,5
B00009NDCX,"If you have an Epson inkjet (I have two), then you must have Epson printer paper. I have tried other, cheaper brand papers, but they tend to stick, or the ink runs. This paper is tops! My only lament is that I didn't buy two packs, instead of the one.",5
B00009NDCX,Works well with printer and produces good quality photos.,5
B00009NDCX,So I can't use this. I didn't see my printer would bot do this size. I could of sworn it would bit I have the 11x8.5 also and it's what 89% of my photos go on.,4

B00009NDCX,This photo paper and printer producedVery nice pictures. No complaints.,5
B00009NDCX,This paper is specifically for the epson printer. The pictures looked professional in all respects. It easy to use if you have an Epson printer.,5
B0009ILH8C,This product arrived in good condition and I was able to use it to glue together several different puzzles that had been completed. It dries clear and means I will be able to hang the puzzles without them falling apart.,5
B0009ILH8C,It dries clear and is a great product for crafts.,5
B0009ILH8C,use it for puzzles hardens really good,5
B0009ILH8C,I like Mod Podge for sealing projects. The matte is a good choice when you don't want things shiny and just sealed. The 32oz was a good deal when I made my purchase.,5
B0009ILH8C,Perfect for crafting. Using this for Halloween decor. Sealed Mod podge.,5
B0009ILH8C,"Hard to screw this up in shipping anyway, plastic case, not fragile at all, so of course it came 110% on point. I love this product personally, it is amazing for any artistic gluing operation from cutting paper and gluing it down to gluing bigger objects, then applying more of the product to keep it together. Great product!",5
B0009ILH8C,"Mod Podge is a classic decoupage material that is tried and true. I use it for mounting images to wood and for sealing projects and it works very well.My only downside is that dried bits get stuck along the edges of the container and in the lid, which can sometimes end up in the glue itself, causing bumps and/or spots under my prints. This can be avoided if you take care to clean the edge of the container and the inside of the lid, so if you need things to be super smooth and speckle-free, do this.",4
B0009ILH8C,This stuff is amazing.  I used it to glue scrapbooking paper to wood.  Super easy to use and clean up is a breeze!,5
B0009ILH8C,Like,5
B0009ILH8C,"I've just used half of this container making reusable gift boxes.  I use Mod Podge to apply the paper, then I use it on top of the paper to seal and protect.  It leaves a sheer, slightly glossy finish and helps prevent rips and tears.",5
B0009ILH8C,"It's crazy you can't find this spray in any of the big box stores! I was glad to be able to get it here, and for the price you'd be shocked how much I was able to cover with one can. I was very happy with it being truly matte like it's supposed to be! I was nervous because basically all the items I had to spray (like my outdoor faux wicker chairs) would've looked ridiculous if this had actually come out with any level of gloss. But thankfully, it's a perfect matte and it's so matte that it's actually hard to tell where you applied it. Only time will tell if it does its job, though. I sure hope so because I sprayed it on some outdoor decorative items that I really do not want to lose their color!",4
B0009ILH8C,"Mod Podge does exactly what it says it does. I use Mod Podge for craft projects, puzzles, and other fun crafts. Mod Podge is easy to use and dries clear. I will continue to purchase Mod Podge whenever I need it.",5
B0009ILH8C,"This is the perfect glue for preserving jigsaw puzzles.  It provides a matte finish.  I really like the fact that because it goes on white you can see that all the puzzle spaces have been filled in, that you haven't missed any.  Most of the puzzles I do are 1000 or more pieces and the bottle of Mod Podge lasts a very long time.",5
B0009ILH8C,Used this on Styrofoam in a diorama so the paint wouldn't melt the foam.,5
B0009ILH8C,Great stuff for crafting,5
B0009ILH8C,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              Excelente pegamento para pegar papel se Seca muy rapido,5
B0009ILH8C,"Mod Podge, seems it's been around forever.  Used the brand a lot in 90s for many craft projects as it worked so well.Recently did an expensive wood jigsaw puzzle which I then thought would look beautiful on my wall.Wasn't sure how well Mod Podge would do with thick wood pieces, all 286 of them but I proceeded to glue and seal the puzzle.  It dried very quickly, I put a coat on front, turned and a coat on back and a final light coat on front.The puzzle is still hanging and Mod Podgecontinues to be the great product I remember from back in the day.",5
B0009ILH8C,Awesome Product,5
B0009ILH8C,Easy clean up works well,5
B0009ILH8C,"Brilliant product (have been using this since staring my crafting business on ETSY - ShaShine Design) and making my own crafts and need to ensure that they are sealed good. Talked to others and was told many great things about Mod podge from both professional and friends that were crafters so I used this and was very happy, it is excellent, will be sticking with it as does everything it says it will, I normally use the 32oz and so as I use it, it does not dry or get clumps before I have finished the container. It is also good economically.I use it to seal paint, vinal lettering and adhere card stock or pictures to my wood shapes & designs. I am EXTREMELY ""PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT"" It is Fantastic have even you used it on a few ceramic decorative mugs as well.",5
B0009ILH8C,"The product was delivered on time, quality was good and it was packaged well.",5
B0009ILH8C,Drys fairly quickly and perfect size.,5
B0009ILH8C,"Use as a glue or as a coating, either way, works great!",5
B0009ILH8C,We used this to glue puzzles together and hang in a poster frame. Work great for what I needed it for and the price was great!,5
B0009ILH8C,I use mod podge for so many different projects that this giant size is perfect for me. i also love that i can pour it into smaller containers or dip right in!,5
B0009ILH8C,Works great for gluing puzzles together so they can be framed.,5
B0009ILH8C,Love this product works great easy to use,5
B0009ILH8C,"I bought the 32 ounce matte mod podge and used it to seal these stickers onto my nightstand. I used 6 layers and had way too much mod podge left over but I'm excited to use it for future ""crafts"". mod podge isn't meant for heavy use and is not water proof (there is dishwasher safe mod podge which is highly water resistant). so, since it is not for heavy use or water resistant I should not have used it for this and should have used resin but I very simply was lazy :)! mod podge is super easy to use as a glue or sealant and does leave deep streaks (which you're supposed to wet sand down) but they leave a nice texture and are hardly noticeable. I highly recommend this for simple crafts (were you can apply a single layer as a quick sealant or glue) or bigger things where you would apply 5 coats (20-30 minutes to dry between) and wet sand it then polish with steel wool (this is what the easy to understand directions on the back said). you could also just wing it and expect it to turn out ok (since it most likely will with mod podge)! it is water based so it could wither paper. I hope this helps!",4
B0009ILH8C,true description of product,5
B0009ILH8C,I used this to glue a puzzle together and it was perfect. Dried nicely. Didnt clump.,5
B0009ILH8C,Quality was worth the price!,5
B0009ILH8C,"I like that it is very easy to apply, leaves no brush strokes and cleans up with water.",5
B0009ILH8C,I use a LOT of Mod Podge it my go to for all kinds of crafts,5
B0009ILH8C,This stuff is a perfect sealer for crafts. I have both the shiny and matte depending on type of art form. I use it all the time as a finishing agent. Good stuff,5
B0009ILH8C,My favorite craft glue for arts and crafts because of how versatile it is,5
B0009ILH8C,Bought as a gift but was told works just as described,5
B0009ILH8C,I bought this to glue puzzles together. I have done 4 puzzles using this glue. Dries clear. Keeps puzzles together really good.,5
B0009ILH8C,I use it more often than I thought I would. I like that the product dries nice and hard with no color of glue shown,4
B0009ILH8C,"I used this Mod Podge to help grandchildren with special decoupaged gifts for their parents.  Toddler babies made finger paint coasters and a five year old decorated glass candle holders with tissue--both were easy projects with Mod Podge and fairly quick.  Obviously, I did a lot of the work for the babies, gluing their paintings onto tiles and covering them with 5 layers of Mod Podge.  The five year old managed her project with much less help.  One caveat:  I think many projects would be most successful if followed up with a clear acrylic sealer (Mod Podge has one)--just to give them extra protection.  This does require you to allow the Mod Podge to ""mature"" for 30 days or so, which requires some planning.  I'm so happy with the results (as are the giftee parents) that the extra wait time was definitely worth it.  Since these projects were finished so easily, I've also Mod Podged a pillbox and a soap dispenser, and am poking around to find other things to decorate.  Lots of fun!",5
B0009ILH8C,4 quarts of this cost less than buying a gallon.,5
B0009ILH8C,This is a great product. I used it to decoupage a photo on canvas. The photo on canvas came out amazing. I will be purchasing this product again.,5
B0009ILH8C,"I use Mod Podge; I like it for puzzles. But this bottle was delivered damaged, affecting other items in my delivery. The interior seal was partly open and the lid was so loose it fell off in my hand. Spilled Mod Podge glue coated everything in the bag-package--I was able to wash it all off (quickly!) for the sealed bottles, but I also had an electronic device...still waiting to see if it was damaged. Good thing I brought I retrieved pkg from porch quickly!!!",1
B0009ILH8C,Great for gluing puzzles together that I want to keep,5
B0009ILH8C,Perfect for puzzles and dries quick.,5
B0009ILH8C,This is a great price fur the amount,5
B0009ILH8C,"I painted my interior trim with Behr Deck and Patio paint which is enamel-based. The paint didn't adhere to the vinyl trim and would scratch off. I painted the trim with MP, and it doesn't scratch anymore. I just painted a stained toilet seat cover with the Behr paint to match the trim in the bathroom. I let it dry, then heavily coated the seat cover with MP, and it is just fantastic. I'm glad I bought the big bottle because I have a lot of trim to seal.",5
B0009ILH8C,"As always, my go to.",5
B0009ILH8C,Great price,4
B0009ILH8C,Good,5
B0009ILH8C,"Product works well, hold glitter on well. Will be ordering again.",5
B0009ILH8C,Use for gluing puzzles. Works great. Dries clear.,5
B0009ILH8C,"So you're ready for the big boy bottle of Mod Podge huh? Yeah, you are!I've completed so many projects with this one jar it's such a good value. I've used it to transfer prints onto wood several times. I've finished 3 or 4 wood working projects with it as I use chalk paint & stain as the undercoats and then use this to seal it giving it, I think, a better than polyurethane ""look"" finish. It applies and dries easier than varnish and poly.I've used this to seal wood inside a laminar hood, glue and seal ""stickers"" that I custom designed for several projects. The uses are so many, this product really is versatile.Just be mindful that this dries quickly and to pour out what you think you'll use into a container and seal this up as it will start to develop a film quicker than the smaller jars (it seems to me). I'm guessing due to the lager opening than the other jars I've used in the past.",5
B0009ILH8C,I have used this product for years. Always great to have on hand for craft projects. Nice I can get on Amazon now.,5
B0009ILH8C,I made some beautiful collage lanterns with this.  There are many different crafts this is used for.,5
B0009ILH8C,"We all know and love mod Podge. This time the container was not properly closed and it spilled during shipping, as you can see on the picture. Fortunately the other items were well wrapped in plastic, so no loss. I did not file a return request because frankly, i do not want to deal with returning a container that may not be good for shipping. I only hope someone in Amazon reads this and are more careful next time. It's all good, people! Let's just be better! Peace.",4
B0009ILH8C,This is a staple on my craft shelves. It has so many uses that I must keep it stocked.,5
B0009ILH8C,"The product is great, but the bottle I received in a plastic shipping bag did NOT have a lid! Luckily, the foil seal was not punctured and I will have a lid from an almost empty bottle.",4
B0009ILH8C,I have been using this for years! This stuff is excellent for decoupage and many other projects!,5
B0009ILH8C,I use mod podge for so many projects and crafts. It always does a great job! I like to put puzzles together and decided to try glue them after I put them together. I was looking at buying a puzzle glue and bought a bottle that was really small but expensive. It did the job but nothing special. The glue didn't last long so when it was out I wanted a cheaper option. I had mod podge on hand and decided to give it a try. Mod podge did a really good job and now I glue every puzzle with it. I actually think it is stronger and does a better job than puzzle glue and it is so much cheaper. Mod podge is thicker than puzzle glue so it makes it easier to apply and clean up. I now keep mod podge on hand at all times so I have glue for any project that comes up.,5
B0009ILH8C,Bigger bottle than expected ! Happy buyer here.,5
B0009ILH8C,This stuff is good for All kinds of crafts,5
B0009ILH8C,Very surprised at the amt of product,5
B0009ILH8C,"I have always used white glue to mod podge my items but I decided to give this a try.  I will never go back to using white glue again.  A little goes a long way.  What took me three or four layers of regular glue, this does in one coat.  After 3-4 layers you have a beautiful finish and it dries quickly.  I've used it on paper, fabric, wood, and plastic and it adheres to every surface.  If you are a seasoned pro or a decopauge newbie, this Mod Podge will get the job done.",5
B0009ILH8C,Suitable for paper to wood projects.,4
B0009ILH8C,"I'm new to the Mod Podge scene and I must admit, I haven't really used it for many things yet.  I purchased it solely for gluing together completed puzzles.  So far I've used it on three puzzles and it has worked very well, even better than another product I bought that was supposedly created for gluing puzzles.The main reason I like Mod Podge over some other glues, is that when you're applying it, it does not go on clear, yet it dries clear.  This takes the guesswork out of worrying if you;ve already covered a spot or not.  Back to my personal example of gluing puzzles; when I used the other product that went on clear, I literally had to use other objects to keep track of what I had already covered to make sure I got every inch of the puzzle.  With Mod Podge, it's just like painting, so you can easily see paint it on and it dries clear.",5
B0009ILH8C,I used this to add detail to drawers on a dresser I refinished. It came out even better than expected!!! Drying time was faster than I thought it would be also! Amazing how a little tissue paper and mod podge can change a simple project into something extraordinary!,5
B0009ILH8C,"I like the quantity for price. Lasts longer.As for use it doesnt seem to work as well as the last one I bought from Hobby Lobby.Seems as though I really have to cake it on to even somewhat get it to keep my puzzles together. It works, but maybe not to what Ive had before.",4
B0009ILH8C,"I got the large yellow bottle of Matte. I saw ""Matte"", but somehow thought I ordered Satin, which is what I really wanted and have used before. I like the low sheen of satin. The matte is definitely flat and is very noticeable if you are using it on something semi shiny (I was using it to apply stickers to a box that had a shine to it.) I also thought the satin bottle lasted longer than the matte is lasting, probably because I can see the small shine and know I've covered it with enough coats, whereas the matte, I'm not really sure when it dries if it's covered enough (and I keep trying to get it to look like I want it to look in my head.) Anyway, it does what it's supposed to do and it perfectly matte for those who want matte, but I think I will stick with satin for now on.",4
B0009ILH8C,Mod Podge is the glue to use for most projects that require good adhesion and sheerness. I'd recommend a Mod Podge brush to help finish the gluing project...especially puzzles. Great investment when you want to create a memory to cherish for a very long time.,5
B0009ILH8C,"Everything worked out fine on my puzzle.  I sloshed the material on with a paintbrush and used a plastic scraper (from the Dollar store) to smooth.  Beforehand, make sure you run your scraper lightly over a piece of sandpaper to knock off any tiny edges to prevent streaks.  Used wax paper under puzzle which worked out good.  Try to lay out the wax paper beyond the edges of the puzzle to pick up any scraped off material.  Have paper towels and water available to clean up any mess afterwards before it dries.  Coated the front side once and using the paintbrush only, did the back side once.  My puzzle looks beautiful.  The matted finish of this product looks very good.",5
B0009ILH8C,Easy to put on and sticks well.,5
B0009ILH8C,It arrived quickly.,5
B0009ILH8C,Product worked great but the product was opened inside the box when I got it. I managed to have enough to work but what a mess.,4
B0009ILH8C,"The Mod Podge CS11303 Waterbase Sealer in matte finish is perfect for gluing puzzles for preservation!  Apply to puzzles with a soft bristle brush or a sponge.  A couple of coats on the picture side of the puzzle should be enough to allow the puzzle to be handled carefully.  Multiple thin coats will stiffen the puzzle to allow for framing.  A 32 oz jar of Modge Podge will easily cover 10+ puzzles with multiple coats.  To clean the brush, simply rinse with water.",5
B0009ILH8C,"I LOVE Mod Podge! I am a child of the 70's and my Mom loved it and passed it on to me! Jan Wetstone invented it in the 60s and even sealed her Volkswagen beetle with it. It is the most versatile sealer on the market. It comes in different formulas including dishwasher safe. I use it to coat resin pieces, decoupage, sealing paper crafts, sealing wood crafts, sealing fabric, sugar coating on putz houses, and sealing any painted project including oil based paints. I love the matte formula for what I do, but have tried all the others and the formula is ease of use if consistent throughout.",5
B0009ILH8C,Great value,5
B0009ILH8C,Works just like ot should.  I like the thick plastic type finish it leaves.  It is very matt.,5
B0009ILH8C,We used this on all our puzzles.This is great stuff and dried clear for our puzzles,5
B0009ILH8C,Works grate. Good price I will definitely purchase again,5
B0009ILH8C,Very high quality,5
B0009ILH8C,I use this for all my puzzles on poster boards. It's quick easy and not messy. Very reliable. I prefer matte finish to glossy.,4
B0009ILH8C,"Happy to add this product to my list of ""needs"" when it comes to my crafting.  This glue is a very good sealer for many of the products and items that I have used it on. It's easily applied and you can even wash your brushes immediately after using it and they are still good to use again. I generally let my item dry for a few hours or more but thin coats seem to dry within a matter of just a few minutes. You can see it turning clear when it's drying. I did buy the ""matte"" version and when it's dry, the seal does have a matte like feel and look to it. I will buy this again.",5
B0009ILH8C,"And it still is a wonderful product.  My husband builds the puzzles and I use this fantastic stuff called Mode Podge to glue both sides of said puzzle,  It's the best for puzzles or anything else for that matter.  It has my recommendation...",5
B0009ILH8C,"Arrived in a timely manner and I'm very satisfied!! I got a ton of Mod Podge, as this is a huge bottle. Great price for the amount you get!",5
B0009ILH8C,I used this product for several things and I love it. I painted it on ceramic pieces I had painted and applied extra fine glitter .Glitter stuck fast and just blew off the excess. I also used this to glue lights in a ceramic snow man that I made and the lights stuck fast when they had dried. The product dries clear so I didn't have to worry about any excess that may have been left behind because it just blended right in .,5
B0009ILH8C,"Even though it had a seal inside, it came open  in the box and spilled all over three other items it shipped with. Make sure it ships separately!!",4
B0009ILH8C,As someone who loves to do arts and crafts  I am a repeat purchaser and pleased with the product.,5
B000N4AI8M,Arrived quickly and as expected. Good price.,5
B000N4AI8M,"The Post-it Super Sticky Easel Pad has been an absolute game-changer in our workplace. Its adhesive backing ensures it stays in place, and the large, easy-to-tear pages make it incredibly versatile. Whether for brainstorming sessions, presentations, or simply jotting down ideas, this easel pad has become an indispensable tool. The vibrant colors and smooth paper quality enhance our creativity and productivity. It's a fantastic addition to any office, and I can't recommend it enough!",5
B000N4AI8M,"Our school uses these in so many ways. I order them every year, and will order them next year, and the year after that.",5
B000N4AI8M,Great product!,5
B000N4AI8M,"I use them all the time for my classes, my only complaint is that they are soo expensive.  Too expensive.  But, I still continue to buy them because I love them.  I just wish they were cheaper.",4
B000N4AI8M,"I use this product to write out the practice schedules for my cheer team, and it is the perfect size so all the girls can see even from the back. It also has a whole at the top that makes it easy to hang up the whole pad if need be, but the adhesive works very well too. So far, it has stuck to all surfaces for as long as I need. It has never fallen down unexpectedly I always end up taking it off. The price is not bad either considering there are 4 pads and each pad lasts a decent amount of time. Finally, these are pretty one of a kind there is no product that can accurately replicate the jobs it does making the price worth it.",5
B000N4AI8M,"I really like these for a variety of things in the classroom.  I have considered purchasing reusable, dry erase ""pages,"" as these tablets are pricey.  I am brand loyal to 3M / Post It, so have not tried other paper versions of the poster pads.  But, I was able to get when price was down a bit, or on sale, a few times. I use for specific topics in lecture that I can draw the pictures beforehand, to save time, as well as ensure correctness!!  A bigger use is when I do class activities with small groups - both having a group on one sheet with info, or a variety, and have the groups rotate for the activity.  They are a good size, and stick well, yet remove easily.",5
B000N4AI8M,Love these sticky notes for classroom work,5
B000N4AI8M,I am using these in my classroom. They work really well and are sturdy. The adhesive allows me to display the poster for several days for student reference.,5
B000N4AI8M,"All good, just whoever packed my box needed to be more careful next time. The tape stuck to the first sheet of paper and could not be separated.",4
B000N4AI8M,Can't go wrong with the 3M Branded flip chart paper.,5
B000N4AI8M,"I always buy the name brand of these because they are just better. I use them a lot in the classroom and have always loved them, but this batch had hardly any perforation, which made them difficult to tear and left my anchor charts looking a mess. Disappointing, because these are not cheap.",4
B000N4AI8M,"I use a pad of this paper every month. I like buying it from Amazon and find the ordering ( of course) and the delivery to be convenient. The paper works great as I don't use an easel but stick the paper on the wall to use.  It NEVER bleeds which is a huge plus for me. Sometimes I wish the paper were a little more sticky than it is. I give 3M a little break since the weather is getting humid.I buy them three at a time and the Amazon price is much better than the local office supply store.What keeps this product from being great is the backboard.  It's always bent.  They saved a few cents on the backboard and the result is irritating.  The pads don't stand up on their own. They don't protect the paper as well as they should and if I am not uber-careful, the  paper can get creased or curled as a result.3M is close to a great product.",3
B000N4AI8M,These are amazing if you need anchor charts.  They can be layered on top of each other and used for months.  I love that they are not lined.  That way I can create my own posters.,5
B000N4AI8M,It was delivered on time and has been very helpful.,5
B000N4AI8M,These are about as advertised but expensive for what you get. The holder I bought with it was total garbage.  You are buying large expensive sticky pads.,4
B000N4AI8M,"I probably buy a set of four of these every 3 months, we are very happy although I did run my hand over one of the walls we use them on the other day and discovered we have a sticky residue issue going on... hopefully a wash down with some murphy's oil will help. Our conference room has gorgeous wood paneled walls.",4
B000N4AI8M,Love these for English group projects at school!,5
B000N4AI8M,Posters always fall off the walls in my classroom due to humidity in the room. Like every day I put them back up. But these always stay!,5
B000N4AI8M,"One of the packs had a tear down the middle of the pages, making that whole pack unusable.",3
B000N4AI8M,It fits our easle perfectly. We won't buy any other brand. The adhesive works great and we haven't ever had any issues with this product.,5
B000N4AI8M,"We purchased these for our teachers to use in their classrooms.  We've purchased less costly off-brand pads in the past, but the paper was very thin, so if the students or teachers used a marker to write on them, the ink bled through onto the wall where the paper was mounted.  However, Post-It brand provides thicker paper with no bleed through and the pages stay put until you remove them.  They cost more than the off brand, but they are worth it.",5
B000N4AI8M,These post notes stick to most surfaces. This is an excellent quality getting four notepads for this price. I will not waste my money at Staples or Office Depot. As a teacher I appreciate this deal.,5
B000N4AI8M,"These are an excellent product to use in the classroom or business room. The pads are large, easy to handle, and the stickiness is good on a multitude of services. They tear off just fine, without a lot of wrestling. Very handy very useful.",5
B000N4AI8M,I use these for work all the time. It is way better to buy in bulk rather than one at a time for money saving purposes,5
B000N4AI8M,Purchased for classes I teach which require group assignments. Having the post it version allows students to stick their answers on the wall for all to see.,5
B000N4AI8M,Pads arrived on time.  Performed as expected.,5
B000N4AI8M,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I wish I could return one pad out of the four, because three of them are fine, and the fourth is pretty beat up.The top paper has a weird textured line in the middle, maybe because of the packing tape of the box?Also, the first half dozen pages in that same easel pad aren't post-its, just tear off. They don't adhere to anything. I'm glad I checked before using it, because otherwise I'd have drawn the whole thing on the easel, then tried to post it, and it would've just been a sheet of paper.The other three pads seem fine.Maybe it was a manufacturing defect.It's not that big a deal, but also these are pretty expensive, so I'm unhappy one of them came damaged.",2
B000N4AI8M,I buy these for the teachers at the beginning of the school year.  I have a thing for office supplies.  And it's hard to pass up a post-it.  So these giant glorious beasts always put a smile on the teachers faces!!!  And it helps I purchased on PrimeDay.,5
B000N4AI8M,Great quality at a decent price. My students love making informational posters on these; we're able to have these hanging for about 2-3 weeks before some of them start falling down.,5
B000N4AI8M,"Very good quality, sticks well.",5
B000N4AI8M,Use this in our classes,5
B000N4AI8M,These are perfect for retreat meetings and when big screens and electricity are not available.  Plus you can tear off and place wherever you want them around the room!,5
B000N4AI8M,They actually stick and stay on! Very easy to use and good high quality paper. Worth the money. Make sure not to use to heavy of a permanent marker because it might bleed through to the next page.,5
B000N4AI8M,Useful for a mind map when I'm writing my paper. And this is really a good price.,5
B000N4AI8M,Good product as pictured. Received quickly. Fair and reasonable price over what is offered through nationwide office supply stores online. Will use this as a resource again.,5
B000N4AI8M,We bought these for [very non-office-y] family brainstorming. It's amazing how often we reach for them. The paper is thick enough to withstand marker ink without having it soak through. And the adhesive is strong (even after multiple moves of the sheet) without tearing or leaving residue behind when sheets are removed from the wall.,5
B000N4AI8M,"Supersized post-it? I'm IN! These things are a lifesaver for brainstorming sessions, meetings and trainings where you can just take off a sheet and stick it to the nearest wall for easy work space, much easier than whiteboards and much more portable. They work well and i have never had an issue with them sticking.",5
B000N4AI8M,Loves these boards use them in my office to work on meetings projects. Design and more. I stick them to my wall and go to town.,5
B000N4AI8M,These are a gift for teachers. It makes it so much easier to display charts and student thinking in the classroom.,5
B000N4AI8M,"3M products are always my go-to for easel pads.  I was very disappointed when I opened the package to find that the paper pad was defective, and not stapled to the cardboard backing.  I know this was a manufacturing mistake, and not typical of 3m products.  In the moment when I needed the pads, I had to improvise and use the defective product.  This made for a very sloppy presentation at my workplace.  The product that I depend on let me down.  Now, I am unable to return the product.",2
B000N4AI8M,I use this in my classroom every day and not say enough good about the quality of the product.,5
B000N4AI8M,We bought these pads to test on our easels to make sure they would work.The pads worked fine on our easels and easy to mount.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042AUMTS,5
B000N4AI8M,"As a teacher, I use these as anchor charts in my classroom and they work great. They are sized just right, easy to peel and stick, and great to write on with markers.",5
B000N4AI8M,At a local store the same item was half the amount that I paid for the package of four!,5
B000N4AI8M,Product shipped without any damage. Product is exactly as expected from description.,5
B000N4AI8M,Amazing for kiddos who home school or are going to school virtually.,5
B000N4AI8M,"This was exactly what I needed for my high school classroom.  It arrived sooner than promised, and the price was better than I could find locally.  My students love working with these and then posting their products for all to see.",5
B000N4AI8M,The paper is a little thin & the cardboard flimsy. Works OK.,4
B000N4AI8M,"I use these in my classroom. I haven't yet needed to use the sticky backs to put up around the room, but the paper quality is excellent and there's no bleed-through when using my flip chart pens.",5
B000N4AI8M,Perfect for planning and notes,5
B000N4AI8M,Counseling sessions,5
B000N4AI8M,"This was supposed to be a 4-pack, and only one showed up. The top pages were also damaged in storage, wrinkled and folded.",1
B000N4AI8M,Great teacher product,5
B000N4AI8M,Perfect tool for brainstorming in meetings. You do need an easel for using these. They stick and re-stick on the wall several times and do no a residue. Markers do not bleed through these pages either.,5
B000N4AI8M,"Unfortunately, one of the pads in my order was defective. It seems the staples did not go through the actual sheets of paper, so it will not be possible to hang this pad on an easel. I contacted the seller and was informed they would not replace it because it was three days past the 30 day return period and there were no exceptions. I did not open the product immediately upon receipt, as I was out of town. This product was for teacher training in Africa for a small non-profit I manage, and fully one-fourth of my order is not usable. I am disappointed by the vendor's unwillingness to work with me.",1
B000N4AI8M,These are great tools for being onsite at conferences. They allow our clients to stick to the walls in board meetings to help organize all of our ideas.,5
B000N4AI8M,Pretty good!,5
B000N4AI8M,Got the job done! Retreat was a big success!,5
B000N4AI8M,Helpful for second grade class,5
B000N4AI8M,Amazing value.Saved $60 if I would have purchased from Staples,5
B000N4AI8M,Love this chart paper.  I am a teacher and use them often in my class.,5
B000N4AI8M,Used for work,5
B000N4AI8M,Worked great for off-site meetings,5
B000N4AI8M,As expected.,5
B000N4AI8M,Excellent price,5
B000N4AI8M,Great grip on walls,5
B000N4AI8M,"Very efficient. Used to hate to have to tape up sheets for review. The adhesive sticks great to walls, blackboards, etc.",5
B000N4AI8M,"Great product, planning to purchase again for our new office.",5
B000N4AI8M,favorite,5
B000N4AI8M,"Arrived fast and as described,",5
B000N4AI8M,Met with my expectation and worked well for my multiple training sessions,5
B000N4AI8M,"Our PTO bought these for our teachers last fall, and they LOVE them!!  A very helpful tool to assist learning!!",5
B000N4AI8M,"Just as good as what we can buy locally, and about half the cost when I ordered the larger quantity.",5
B000N4AI8M,"These work well, especially for design sprints, but are quite pricey for what you get.",5
B000N4AI8M,Nice deal for four of these shipped to my event!,5
B000N4AI8M,Met expectations,5
B000N4AI8M,"So far, 3 out of 4 of the pads in the pack are defective. The staples holding the pages inside the handle and backing are misaligned, so the pages break free and slide out of the pad. Makes it extremely difficult to transport these to/from meetings. I had to buy a heavy duty stapler to put the pads back together.",2
B000N4AI8M,Product as described,5
B000N4AI8M,These are great easel pads with post it capabilities so that you can post to walls. They work great with flip chart easel holders!,5
B000N4AI8M,Ordered for the 6th grade teachers at our school. They LOVE them!!,5
B000N4AI8M,"I purchased these off Amazon Warehouse because they were a steal of a deal!!! I know why.... Even if you put them on an easel, the cardboard is most likely made out of runny concrete... It seriously folds and crumbles down.What this would be good for:If you had a dedicated spot to nail it to the wall and not use the backing for any reason.. Then it's perfect that's the reason for the extra star",2
B000N4AI8M,Ok,5
B000N4AI8M,Just as expected.,5
B000N4AI8M,Got them damaged. Contacted support and they gave me some refund. Otherwise these are great pads.,4
B000N4AI8M,Just what I was looking for and fairly priced.,5
B000N4AI8M,Typical 3M quality products. Reliable as always.,5
B000N4AI8M,Great price for 4 pads of Easel paper,5
B000N4AI8M,As expected,5
B00178RING,Arrived quickly and it was very easy to apply on the inside of shoes that some small areas were starting to peel on the inside.  Glued the small areas very smoothly.  Would buy again.,5
B00178RING,"I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this to repair my moccasin slippers.The product exceeded my expectations in a big way.  The bonding is great, and it is easy to apply.  Just leave enough time for the glue to cure.I would highly recommend this product.",5
B00178RING,This seemed to work well on most items that I tried it on.  I only had issues with one item and that was inside a car.  I assume the glue did not hold due to the high temps the inside of the car can reach on a hot and sunny summer day.,4
B00178RING,I just completely repaired a leather Gucci belt that the lining had come off! very good product.,5
B00178RING,"had an iron on patch for my leather vest, got out the iron and put the patch on. The patch fell off almost immediately. I purchased this glue, followed instructions and it works as advertised. The patch is staying on and holding well.",5
B00178RING,Nice and large great buy,5
B00178RING,good,5
B00178RING,"Okay, you are probably buying this for leather and probably are debating using this vs. rubber cement, which a lot of makers use. I have used both, but I am coming back to Aleene's Leather glue and here are the pros and cons.Pros: glues up leather fast. You can cut pieces you glued together only 3-5 minutes later. The bond isn't invincible, but strong enough. You also get a lot of use out of a bottle, I've made dozens of projects with only a single one. It's also very economical and cheap compared to something like Barge cement.Cons: ruins ability to dye parts of leather if you accidentally touch a part of leather with it on your finger or it smudges. Application is also harder than cement, which you brush. In my case I use my finger as a squeegee to clean up the lines of glue. Once you do it a few times it isn't such a downside.So why use it over cement? For me it's all because of how fast it tacks up, that is the clear reason why. When I am working on a project I like to be doing 1-3 things at a time but my main focus is the piece I want done, and I hate waiting 10 minutes each time for cement application. I am also able to stick the pieces together wet and slide it a bit if I got it off position for the first few seconds, which is important to me. I like making things NOW not waiting a long time, which makes this product 5/5 stars!",5
B00178RING,"This stuck quite well to various pieces of suede I've been working on as a project, and the bond has held quite well. The glue applies fairly well, and the viscosity of the compound aids in that.Overall the value is definitely there, I've used more expensive products with similar results.",5
B00178RING,I used this glue along with a leather repair kit to fix a strap that broke at the base on my purse.  It is holding up strong so far.,5
B00178RING,"I used Aleene's Leather & Suede glue to repair the leather on a car seat. The instructions were quite short, so I wasn't sure if the glue would bond immediately or allow for adjustments. It turns out I could slide the torn leather piece into place and adjust it for another few seconds before it started to bond. It's been a couple of days, and so far, the glue seems to be holding up well.",5
B00178RING,Did not need but a small dab. For that reason it was pricey as I have no other projects at present. But it worked well! Thank you!,4
B00178RING,Strong glue. Not Barge but closeRecommend,5
B00178RING,"It's like Elmer's glue - only very thick.  The arm rests on my 25 year old leather recliner were badly worn and cracked all or the way through - but the rest of it was still fine.  I had some matching leather from a chair that broke - but an upholstery store estimated $200 to repair it.  Instead I glued it over the arms by starting with a line in the middle.  Once it dried I knew the rest would stay in place, so I glued it to within 2 inches of where I was going to trim it to. The next day I trimmed it and did the final glue.  Super easy, and you would never know that It's just glued on.  I am soo glad I paid $5 rather than $200!",5
B00178RING,"Topsider insoles alway come loose, especally if used in and out of water, this is the prfect glue to keep them in place. Highest recomendation for function!",5
B00178RING,I've used this a couple of times now with some leather earrings that I make. This stuff works great! It's easy to use and dried clear and fast!! So far the adhesion has held up very well! Definitely worth it!,5
B00178RING,My husband had a Leather wallet for 10+ years. I was starting to fall apart from being used. That wallet had some sentimental value because A friend of His bought it for him while he was still in school. I knew how much my husband liked that wallet so I was trying to keep up with it every time it was falling apart and was able to help me to do that.,5
B00178RING,Used this to fix a slight tear in some new boots I had that created a small flap in the leather. Was easy to apply and set and now it's almost impossible to tell there was a tear in it.,5
B00178RING,"Needed to put on a earlier patch kit I bought that didn't work.  Truck is 12 years old, and had the drag ass issue on drivers side like most do.",5
B00178RING,Great glue for leather. It is the only one I will use.,5
B00178RING,Purchased to fix a pair of name brand boots and it worked like a charm.,5
B00178RING,The sole of my shoe was coming apart. I cleaned off the dirt and other junk with an air hose. I then used the glue which was easy to apply. I clamped the shoe body to the sole and let the glue dry for three hours. The glue dried clean and is still holding.,5
B00178RING,I was very disappointed in this glue.  Tried using it to repair leather coat - did not work at all.,2
B00178RING,The backing was coming off a well worn and loved belt. Five minutes with this glue the backing is on and I'm still in love. Much cheaper than a new belt.,5
B00178RING,Excellent product that bonds to leather to patch automobile seats,5
B00178RING,Use this for knife sheaths & other leather products like boots & shoes. Sticks really good. Thank you. Eldon,5
B00178RING,Looks great on real leather,5
B00178RING,Good,4
B00178RING,"I was unaware of how to fix leather, but this glue saved me. I was able to glue my hem back together with no damage to the leather and now the skirt is back in service and hasn't fallen apart.",5
B00178RING,"I wish I would have taken a before picture.  I was having new flooring installed in my home, when I noticed a gouge on the bed post.  I tried contacting the furniture store to see if that piece would be sold individually, but they said no.  It was not a big tear, but I have 3 boys and they always use that side of the bed to climb on my bed, so I was afraid that they were going to make a small tear even bigger.  I found this and decided to use it to see it it could help seal the hole.  I am so happy I bought this.  It completely sealed the tear, you no longer see any of the inside material sticking out.  Honestly, the tear no longer looks like a sore thumb sticking out.  I applied the glue, wiped off the excess, and used scotch tape to hold down the material while the glue dried.  A few hours later, voila, it was sealed.  Great product.",5
B00178RING,"Worked exactly as described. I repaired a leather couch that the sewing seam had come loose on the back and fixed a coach purse where the straps were connected. Dries clear, no visible glue marks. Great price, fast shipping.",5
B00178RING,"The cap was sealed shut. After I un-screwed the whole top & pealed off the seal, screwed the cap back on and then pulled off the tiny little cap there was no little whole for the glue to come out. It was a solid top.  I'll know tomorrow if the glue works well. I'll also puncture the top so I can use it the correct way. I'll update this review in a week to see how/if it all works.P.S. I'm using it on faux leather projects. Wallets, bags, etc.",4
B00178RING,I have glued together several pieces of leather thus far with crafts and handbags I have been making.  It works well and doesn't disappoint.  I can see where the glue was because the sheen shows against the leather.  It's not bad enough to complain about that.  Aliens has always been a great product and I am ordering this again.,5
B00178RING,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It went under the leather no problem and seems to have bonded for a tight grip. As of performance well see how long is lasts. Seems quite durable after 6 hours of drying though and its not a huge puncture ( had my pitbull up front) was very easy to apply and for the value is immense, the price u pay and amount you get will last forever.",5
B00178RING,"I think I just wrote a review regarding the seller who my experience with him was good.  And I will write it again.  I did purchase a number of adhesives for bonding miniature leather belts that go on the straps of leather bands for watches.  Believe me - buy after buy indicated a glue that was no good.  I was not doing the job.  Now the reason why I bought them is that it read on the label that it adhered leather, in addition to other fabrics.  So I spended a bit of money for trial and error until I had to look for one that was specifically for what I was looking for.  The internet and Amazon were the places to look.  I searched and found a number of good reviews on this one before I decided to give this one from Aleene's a try.  And it did.  Those ultra small leather belts are called keepers, and are very difficult to find if you want them in larger size.  In my case, I don't think I have found anybody who does.  So I decided to buy some small ones from a dealer, cut them up, and make bigger ones by doing the bonding and stitching myself.  I was beginning to get desperate because nothing was working.  Thankfully I finally found a product that did the job, and did it well.",5
B00178RING,"As long as you scratch up the surface of the leather, this stuff works great",5
B00178RING,Muy buen producto,5
B00178RING,"Fixed my problem right away. Easy to use and quick drying. Had a rabbit fur hat my wife got in Russia back in the late 60's that had started to separate a bit, but the glue put it back in great shape.",5
B00178RING,Needed to repair a leather purse strap that was separating. Applied the product in a thin layer on the rough side of one piece of the leather and then carefully lined up the other side and pressed them together.  After 12 hours the glue was dry. The strap is flexible and the bond secure. The glue consistency is like Elmer's glue so I brushed it on to ensure a thin even application. Was exactly what I needed for the repair.,5
B00178RING,"Good strong glue but you must use it for what it was made for and you will like it, read directions and use as directed, works good, I would buy again.",5
B00178RING,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love this glue for working with leather and other fabrics.  Easy clean up before it dries, and when it dries, it does so clear and with the flexibility needed for Leather and other fabrics.Video is of some paracord I glued to some leather that I will be applying to a leather scabbard I made using a lot of this glue.",5
B00178RING,well,5
B00178RING,"I had a broken pair of sandals where the elastic strap needed to be reattached. The cost of shoe repair at a shop was more than I wanted to spend. I took a gamble on this glue and was so glad that I did. It worked like a charm. I followed the directions and then secured the straps with an additional few stitches for good measure. So far , so good! And, I have enough glue left over for other projects!",5
B00178RING,"Good quality and size, easy to use Durable adhesive worth of value for money",5
B00178RING,I bought this to repair a golf cart seat.  It worked as described and was easy to use.,5
B00178RING,I found a crossbody Michael Kors purse at the thrift store. It was super cheap because the  handle strap had separated. So I ordered this to glue the leather pieces back together. It worked and dries clear.,5
B00178RING,I was worried about some of the bad reviews but I'm happy to report that the glue worked perfectly.  My favorite belt came apart and I was worried that it was beyond repair.  This glue worked repair the two halfs of my leather belt and it seems very strong.  I bent the repaired section and found the adhesive to stand up to flexible movements.  I used it on a leather belt so I'm sure it'll work just fine on all other leather products.,5
B00178RING,"I use a lot of glue of this brand and like the majority. But this one for vinyl and leather did not work for me. I tried it several times on different materials that I needed this type of glue for. It did not work. I was very disappointed. Only in this one, I love the other products that this brand puts out.",3
B00178RING,I haven't had a chance to use it yet.,5
B00178RING,Repaired my watch band and leather belt.  So far so good.  Strong bond and easy to apply.  Cleans up easily if you mess up or if you get a bit of ooze coming out after you press the leather areas together.  Does not leave hard to clean up residue like those other kinds of crazy glues.  Highly recommend!,5
B00178RING,Worked great on my leather computer chair and cant even tell there was a rip.,5
B00178RING,I use it for leather doesnt hold as good as i expected,3
B00178RING,"I have used it once to re-attach a section of a liner in a holster.  So far, it appears to work well enough, but time will tell.  Easy to use and I placed it in the warm area of my heating stove in my living-room overnight.  The repaired area appears to be bonded very well at the moment.  I applied the glue with a small brush typically used in a shop for spreading glue, grease, etc.  Not overly viscous so it spread evenly, but not so thin that it would run easily.  I also do other leather work from time to time, so this should be handy in the future as long as I can keep the plastic bottle out of the heat.",4
B00178RING,"Dude, quickly and easily ,held nicely.",5
B00178RING,This was easy to spread and had enough working time to line everything up.,5
B00178RING,I used the Aleene's leather glue to attach a couple of strips of leather to a wooden box that I mounted on my ATV. I use the box to carry such things as my Chain saw and brush cutter. I made a couple of cut outs in the box for the brush cutter to fit into while riding. I used the leather to pad the area so it would not get beat up. I've used it now for a couple of months in all kinds of weather and the glue has remained strong.It is easy to apply and works better than any glue I have used.,5
B00178RING,Could fix leather watch strap. Applied the glue attached the clips for a day and it glued well.,5
B00178RING,I got this to repair my leather on one of my purse charms. A little glue goes a long way! I was very impressed on how easy it was to spread and clamp together. It is a super tight bond. I would definitely recommend this to repair or even to make new crafts. It works great!,5
B00178RING,"Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is when it dries, it is visible, so you can't use it on top of surfaces and have to make sure that you wipe up any excess or live with it being noticeable.  But other than that, it seems to adhere well, come out of the bottle without any problem and able to direct it where I want.  I'm using it for automotive repairs like replacing steering wheel covers and fixing seats to help adhere the pleather.",4
B00178RING,"I used it only on a small leather bracelet, and it's been holding great. Can't speak about it's real strength on larger items though.",5
B00178RING,This glue works great. I glued together some leather heels and they've been holding on well.,5
B00178RING,This glue has held a split on my leather chair together now for several months and has kept the split from growing. It has also worked on my car headliner that had loosened from the roof.,5
B00178RING,Good for sticking two pieces of material together to sew. Not good for cracks in material. Or fixing separation in shoes or other high movement areas.,4
B00178RING,This product does NOT bond leather to leather.  Not even a little!  Did not try to glue anything else to the leather. It might work for other materials.  There is no smell and it is very easy to apply.,1
B00178RING,"I use this with some leather patches, and the glue was easy to work with, provided a great seal, and was very strong",5
B00178RING,"Did not open right away, when went to use it over a month from received date, discovered that the bottle had beed previously opened - foil seal is broken while the cap dispenser is intact. Disappointing - paid full price for used bottle.",1
B00178RING,"Glues leather, pleather, and even glues well to fabric.  Couldn't be happier with the product. I absolutely love it.",5
B00178RING,This glue is now clear and doesn't hold as well as the white formula.,2
B00178RING,It dries fast and clear use only on the section you are working on first don't spread it and come back to that area because once the air hits it you have to reapply so take your time using it. Works well.I'm finding that my rhinestones are popping off maybe not enough glue or the stones are adjusting I find myself reapplying so I'm looking to try another glue such as gorilla it dries clear also,5

It suits for beginners, because it needs time to fix, at first, They are milky white glue without stickiness, and when dry, they become transparent and sticky very well. I've glued a lot of leather.",5
B00178RING,"as advertised, this glue holds it all togethwr",5
B00178RING,Purcased to adhere military name plate to leather flight jacket. Seperation began on first wearing of jacket.,3
B00178RING,"This glue is OK for tacking on leather, but not what it was suggested in the reviews.  I bought this glue to paste my patches on my biker vest.  This does not work, by the way.  This glue will tack the patch down, but it does not keep it adhered to the leather.  In fact, the glue comes off both the leather and the back of the patch.  It does not matter whether the leather is smooth or not.  I did a test run on completely smooth leather and the patch could be easily peeled off, as well as the glue from the leather and the patch.  I decided to use it anyway to tack my patches down and then sew them on.  It does sort of work for that.",3
B00178RING,This glue works well for leather projects. It sets fast and holds great. I recommend this product for all crafters.,5
B00178RING,"I use this to glue and seal tearing leather on the corner of my bags. There is a brand of bags that I love, but after use, the piping along the edges sadly starts to tear. When this happens, and to repair the item a bit, I glue the torn pieces together and smooth out the glue so it dries evenly. I do about three coats of glue and for the most part, the glue seems to dry pretty clear, as long as you don't overdo it on the amount of glue. Once it dries, I put on two nice coats of black leather paint and the edges look pretty good. I love this product and long story short, I feel it works great on leather and for repair purposes.",5
B00178RING,"This stuff works on small tears and rips.  I use a small toothpick to apply it, and let it dry.  If you go too heavy on the glue, it definitely becomes noticeable and a hardened area.  Stay vigilant.  Key your leather properly cleaned and protected as necessary.  Use this sparingly.I used this on my leather couch from VCF.  After having to have a full cushion replaced because we didn't get it fixed fast enough, I got some of this glue to make repairs as soon as possible.  The small tears and rips I have fixed with this have stayed repair so far.",4
B00178RING,"Many people use the contact cement that must be applied to both surfaces and let dry before pressing together.I prefer this glue.  It does not have the obnoxious odor and soaks into the leather really good. You still have to apply it to both sides, but it doesn't have the instant grab that contact cement has so you can adjust the pieces before it sets up.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"I bought these while I was house sitting for my sister for her son to find on anything I could put them on. They stick well, I only placed them on smooth surfaces or things I knew wouldn't get damaged. They were a bit tricky to peel the back off the tiny ones, so I didn't do as much as I wanted to. My nephew loved finding them throughout the house, on his toys, water bottles, etc. It was a great, inexpensive way to have fun!",5
B07KZF3RRY,"So, decided with another coworker to googly eye a bunch of our coworkers computers and phones. We get to the office much earlier than anyone else so it was easy to do. Over time we would apply these little guys to different peoples phones. It was a little difficult to get the sticky protector off the back, but once we figured it out, these were a great idea and a good value for the quantity and size mixture. It took everyone quite a while to figure out who was doing it.  FUN TIME",5
B07KZF3RRY,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The size selection was great for the 1000 count. The adhesive backs also stick very well, kind of hard to take the back paper off tho. Perfect for vandalizing my boyfriend's room.",5
B07KZF3RRY,Great fun with the kiddo since I missed Defcon! the backs are easy to peel and apply quickly.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"Self adhesive, assorted sizes. Easy to use and apply. Quality adhesive lasts on all types of materials.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"I purchased these for an activity I had planned for the classroom. These are perfect, and what makes them perfect is the case they come with. Getting the ones you want out a bag or pouring out the bag to find the one you need is too much of a pain in a bigger classroom. With the case I was able to set it out and my students could pick the sizes they wanted and the cleanup was so easy! Since they are in a case storage is a HUGE plus. The lid snaps tightly so I didn't feel like I needed to store it in a specific direction. Great buy!",5
B07KZF3RRY,"1,000 reasons to smile. Easy as that.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"They worked well for what I needed. There are a ton of them!Pros: Look good, great value, seem durableCons: Lots of small ones",4
B07KZF3RRY,"used these to add to slime at a birthday party, all the kids loved them",5
B07KZF3RRY,My grandson and I bought these so we could glue them on faces on the cereal boxes in the grocery store,4
B07KZF3RRY,The adhesive backing removed very easily and they seem to stick well enough to most surfaces. Several different sizes. Came in a reclosable plastic case.,5
B07KZF3RRY,Great amount for the price. Lots of different sizes. Many uses as you can stick them or leave the paper back on for less permanent situations. I used for pet rocks in resin and on a cut out and it didn't damage the cut out when taking them off. The storage container they come in is nice also.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"I purchased these 8 months ago and keep them on my person at all opportunities. You never know when something may require sentience, and who am I to deny life to an inanimate object? One does not simply bestow the gift of sight willy-nilly, so I have barely made a dent in the case, however, each Eye of Google has been annointed with precision, care, and the foresight of soiled undergarments. However... some appliances suffer losses deeper than our simple human souls can imagine when the vision they've been blessed with is ripped away from them, left with no depth perception and the philosophical question of ""does one with one eye but no sockets require an eyepatch?""they're just a little too unsticky, but too sticky to easily remove from porous surfaces. giggles shall be had regardless.",4
B07KZF3RRY,Packaging could have been better. The different sizes are all mixed in together. Making it difficult to find the right ones especially the ones that are close to size.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"I find googly eyes comical, and they never fail to put a smile on my face. I find these are great for a minimal style prank, they stick well to most things and the variety of sizes means you always have the right size. the only downside I've found is depending on how long you leave them on something they may leave a sticky residue, but I was able to get it off quickly with some goof-off.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"Good color, not much storage required, and value for money",5
B07KZF3RRY,"I have to laugh at how many eyes this is.My kid at the time had a ball sticking these on random objects, like our Remotes and other appliances.It is exactly what it says. Beware children going overboard in the house LOL",5
B07KZF3RRY,These are really fun however; they are impossible to peak the backing off. We tried a sharp knife; tweezers and they are too difficult for a kid to peak off for a craft,3
B07KZF3RRY,These are good quality and quantity for this price! They stick to finger paint and are easy to use.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"Lost a staring contest, they are unbeatable!",5
B07KZF3RRY,Shipped quickly in a nice plastic container. Assorted sizes.Con: hard to get the backing off.,4
B07KZF3RRY,Hard to peel the backing off so you can stick on things.  These are also smaller than expected,4
B07KZF3RRY,Product is as described. They come in three sizes and the backs do have a peel off paper to make them sticky. No glue required.,5
B07KZF3RRY,The small eyes need a bigger container so the little eyes can shake about. They work great if u are just giving something eyes. But if u want them to move around u might wanna get something else.The bigger ones work decent for Googly-ness.They are great for the price though. U get plenty to play around with.,3
B07KZF3RRY,"I bought these for a school project for my kid. For the 100th day of school, she had to make something out of 100 of the same item. So we picked googly eyes and made a llama on posterboard. Once we were done, I let her have the pack to play with and do crafts. They ended up spilling. Every so often I find googly eyes in the most random places. They show up in my washer. Sometimes they find the bottom of a shoe. Other times my husband finds them and sticks them in places to see if I notice. This was not a dull purchase. 10/10.",5
B07KZF3RRY,Gave my grandson these last Xmas. He had a blast with them. Jokes on you daughter and son in law.  Lol,5
B07KZF3RRY,"Stick these on your camera during Zoom calls: now it feels a little more like you're staring into some sort of human-resemblance of an eye with consistency.Put a pair on your coffee pot: Satisfaction from yelling at it when it decides to overflow in the filter resulting in coffee grounds in your pot is much more satisfying.Put them on items in your workplace: Who doesn't enjoy a toilet paper dispenser that watches you take a dump? Or maybe a stapler that now seems to have some sort of bloodlust for you with it's cold, unwavering stare?On rare occasions when you visit your family, you can put one in the shower drain so a wandering eye can be seen from the depths staring up at your least favorite relative.The opportunities are endless. Happy Googlying!",5
B07KZF3RRY,"As a 32 year old adult who owns their own home I knew these were for me the second I saw them. I spent most of Xmas day sneaking away from my parents to absolutely ruin their house with these. Both Roombas, all of the remotes, every single subject within a photo frame, the toilets, the milk, the printer, any sort of statuette, scissors, chapstick, candles, nothing (non-damagable) was spared.I was to underscore the importance of non-damagable real quick because the sticky on these puppies is no joke. Within hours I was tasked with removing some of the eyes and oh they were good and stuck. Not that it's a problem, just something to keep in mind.It's February now and I'm still getting phone calls from my desperate parents complaining about the TV's watching them back.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"So I bought these for my kids, because they thought it would be fun to go to the grocery store and stick these to random products that had a faces or faces...  :-)",5
B07KZF3RRY,Great for projects or practical jokes.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"I put these all over my boyfriends things for April Fools day - Got up early and just started putting them on everything. On the chairs, all the desk ornaments, files, photos, figurines, computers, soap bottles, etc. He laughed and they worked perfect!Out of all of those eyes, maybe like 2 were damaged? Not a big deal, and the only issue I had was getting the sticky backing off at first but made it easier by getting a thumb tac and peeling off with it - No major problem!",5
B07KZF3RRY,used to place on random items at the grocery store!  much fun for the price of admission!!  LOL,4
B07KZF3RRY,Great assortment.,4
B07KZF3RRY,The eyes worked out ok but a lot of them are very small. Not for little crafters,3
B07KZF3RRY,"Fun.  Now we have eyeballs everywhere.  On shoes, on chairs, walls, books.  Fun.",5
B07KZF3RRY,You get a lot for the price! I'm not sure why people had issues with these. They're easy to peel and they stick fairly well. You get a good variety of sizes. Definitely recommend if you want to have a little fun around the house or play pranks with friends! Highly recommend.,5
B07KZF3RRY,Sticker is hard to get to but once you do. Everything has eyes!!! I mean everything,4
B07KZF3RRY,"Other reviews are correct on the hard to remove backing.  I found that if I press my thumb and pointer finger hard on each side and try to slide them opposite directions the backing will slide off easier than trying to peel it.I got them as a joke and put them on several pictures in my moms house.  When she found them and tried to remove them, she said they were tough to get off, so adhesion was good.",4
B07KZF3RRY,Were good quality but smaller than expected,4
B07KZF3RRY,"It seems silly to review googly eyes, but if I can save one other person... these eyes are eerie. They arrive in a clear plastic bag... 1,000 eyes just staring at you, pleading for air and something more interesting to look at. At the slightest movement they wiggle nervously like they are up to something. And I swear they are multiplying...there are three generations of eyes in the bag -- Mommy eyes, Child eyes and Baby eyes. Those baby eyes are innocent of course, but the Mommy eyes --- I'm pretty sure they are from the back of her head -- and they seem to know everything I do. [Real feedback -- very hard to peel adhesive off the back of the eyes; need a pin to prick up an edge.]",4
B07KZF3RRY,"Cute eye googlies, but poor peel-off backs. Nearly impossible to remove.",3
B07KZF3RRY,The eyes themselves are great but the adhesive doesn't stick worth a flip. They have to be glued on.,4
B07KZF3RRY,"There are a lot of eyes in this package! I will never run out! And it's a nice box. They're easy to apply, although a few fell off when I wanted them to stay put. A few have the backing a bit off -center from the eye. What I don't like about them is there are no very big or very small ones. For the smaller side, I would prefer the ones that have a spherical ball inside (that make a rattling sound) instead of a disc. And for some cases it's better to have a hole in the back for sewing on instead of the glue sticker. But you get exactly what is described in the ad.",3
B07KZF3RRY,"Excellent product, service and quality for such low and satisfying price.",5
B07KZF3RRY,The only issue is peeling off the backing so they stick,4
B07KZF3RRY,"Eyes seem okay. Not ridiculously hard to get paper off the back like some others. But case they came in was broken, no time for the return/replacement hassle.",3
B07KZF3RRY,We needed these for arts and crafts.  They worked great.  I life that there are different eye sizes in the batch to choose from.,5
B07KZF3RRY,I love the collection of eyes with different sizes!,5
B07KZF3RRY,I love how the googly eyes make my crafts look!,5
B07KZF3RRY,Placed eyes onto painted rocks and placed around the neighborhood.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"don't know about you, but my morale at work improved after i got these.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"This was more wholesome fun than I thought possible.  Our resident teenager requested this item.  They were cheap, it was the beginning of quarantine, I thought why not?  Indeed they did not disappoint.  I've attached a few pictures, these are just a very few of the dozens upon dozens of laughs that were made possible by this little bag of eyeballs.  I still crack up when I open my spice cabinet.  After watching my four kids ignore the screens and stick eyes to things for like most of a day I had amazon send bags of eyeballs to several other quarantined families as well.  Because these jiggly little self-stick lovelies are just that much fun. If you're still thinking about it, stop.  Just click the buy now button.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"They are NOT easy to peel, but once you do manage to peel off the paper, they seem to stick well enough. For the price, they're a ton of fun. Just wish there was a small tab or something to peel off the backs because they are incredibly difficult!",3
B07KZF3RRY,"I am sure my in-laws are tired of my shenanigans, as I have applied these to everything in the house that needed eyes. This is what happens when I am left alone while house-sitting. Buy these if you need an abundance of eyes to stick to stuff. Highly recommend.",5
B07KZF3RRY,One box of different sized small googly eyes.,5
B07KZF3RRY,These are the googliest of googly eyes.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"I'm not quite sure what I'll use these for, but I've wanted some for a while and I'm really excited to have them. So many things need googly eyes!",5
B07KZF3RRY,"I bought this for my husband to amuse himself while being a stay at home parent during recovery from a work injury. It's been great! The adhesive sticks to pretty much everything, plastic, paper, metal, etc. If you have grumpy teenagers to annoy and a kid that likes scavenger hunts then this is a great buy!",5
B07KZF3RRY,"I should have purchased larger ones. These are too small. They're so small it's not only difficult to pick one up, but to get the adhesive off it is almost impossible.",2
B07KZF3RRY,"Backing peels off pretty easily once you get the hang of it. They seem to stick great! Using for a craft project and have a glue gun on hand for other items, but I don't think it'll be needed for the googly eyes.Downside is that all sizes are mixed together--but I knew that when I chose them.",5
B07KZF3RRY,Bought these to decorate my sister's house while she was away.Huge hit!,5
B07KZF3RRY,"These were quite smaller than I anticipated but sizes where listed - so I will definitely take out the tape measure before hitting send on my cart in the future. Still worked for what I purchase them for, so gave them 5 stars...",5
B07KZF3RRY,"Lots of different sizes, great potential, but a lot of them are especially hard to remove the backing. Some of my googly exploits have to be done quickly.",3
B07KZF3RRY,"Hard to peel  to expose the adhesive, not very sticky, but still works",4
B07KZF3RRY,Love the multiple sizes and quantity!  They are sometimes easy to peel- usually one peels just fine and I nearly break a nail or loose my mind with the second one!  They have stuck to everything we put them on however they are super easy to remove and have done no damage to any of the myriad of things we've had fun putting them on. Super fun for a game of hide and seek where we stick them on random things and see if anyone else in the house notices them!  Can't recommend highly enough esp if you have kids or or a kid yourself:),5
B07KZF3RRY,Shenanigans enough said,5
B07KZF3RRY,I will not have to buy wiggle googly eyes for a very long time.,5
B07KZF3RRY,"I had to use tweezers to get the backings removed faster. That did work, but then none of the little ones were sticking. So all of the little ones were not usable unless you reglued them. Even some of the big ones didn't have a great adhesive stick and would fall off.",3
B07KZF3RRY,Nice variety of sizes,5
B07KZF3RRY,"Ever have an overly aggressive pecker? Well our cockerel Elvis was a bad rooster so he got the chicken blinders installed (highly recomend) and went about living with his head intact. Let me tell you- the chicks dig it. Only suggestion, if using around chickens super glue will be needed as the adhesion level does not withstand the poultrys will to eat anything new and cool.Because he is a chicken he moves his head quite a bit, the eyes move and are HILARIOUS.Show me one who does not laugh at that handsome roosters studdly speckled shades and I will show you someone with no soul.",5
B07KZF3RRY,"The plastic box they were in had broken in the mail.  That didn't matter too much as I put them into another container, but the darn things have a paper backing which I assumed covered the self-adhesive surface.I can't get the paper part off.  The paper is stuck fast.Annoying.",3
B07KZF3RRY,"Nice, sturdy craft item, lots of sizes.  Good value.  But I couldn't figure out how to get backing off.  Ended up glueing them on.",4
B07KZF3RRY,"If Your like me, im old school and don't know anything about 4mm 6mm 10mm, what ever happened 1/4 3/8 5/16. i know fractions, that being said, I found that the eyes seem a little small  But after thinking about it , There just the right size that I need them for. They stick great. and are easy to remove if you place them wrong.",5
B07KZF3RRY,Very hard to get the piece off the back to stick them. Frustrating for a full classroom.,4
B07KZF3RRY,"I bought these to play a birthday prank on my boss. It was delivered at least one day late, so I had to change the timing. The worst part was that removing the backing to reveal the self stick surface was extremely difficult and time consuming.",3
B07KZF3RRY,"Good sizes, good quantity, plastic components are good quality, but the adhesion is lacking.  They fall off of most surfaces too easily.  It's also somewhat difficult to remove the backing to expose the adhesive.",3
B07KZF3RRY,"I bought these just for fun. I got them but didn't get around to doing anything with them for awhile. When I finally did, I thought they weren't peel-and-stick with adhesive because the back paper wouldn't come off. It was too late to return them, or I would have. It turns out that it's just really, really difficult to peel off the adhesive paper, but they do work. I was also surprised how small they were--not what I was expecting. That may have been on me for not paying close attention and the measure is in mm so I may have misread. Anyway, I haven't used them much because of the size and difficulty. Wouldn't recommend them",2
B07KZF3RRY,I am now all powerful with these googly eyes on my side!! Mwah ha ha,5
B0006842S2,These are great little scissors. Love the protective cap. Quite sharp and get the job done. Just what I needed!,5
B0006842S2,These scissors are perfect for paper crafting and are very durable.  I purchased a pair 7 years ago and they still cut as well as the first time I bought them. They are an excellent pair of scissors; highly recommended,5
B0006842S2,Love the cover; and it is the perfect size to keep tucked in a drawer for quick clips!  Is sharp and easy to use!  Highly recommend.,5
B0006842S2,Great little scissors.  Very sharp.  I love having a cover on the blade so I can carry them in my bag.,5
B0006842S2,Very sharp - nice and small - love the cover for the blades. These are my favorite scissors.,5
B0006842S2,"I love them. Gave them 4 stars because there was a nick on the outside of one of the blades and it made it EXTREMELY sharp where it shouldn't have been sharp.I was going to exchange them, but forgot. So instead I tried sandpaper, and I was able to sand the nick down enough.",4
B0006842S2,"Great little scissors. I use them for everything. Even have a pair in my purse when traveling, so easy with cover that fits on them. Good value for all the things I use them for. They cut well without sticking.",5
B0006842S2,I sew craft items and these fit my hand and are easy to use.  Might not seem like a big thing but I pick the scissors up every few minutes to snip thread.,5
B0006842S2,Love the size of these scissors-have them in a basket on my desk and grab for them often.  They are both precise and sturdy.  I am glad I bought them.,5
B0006842S2,"GREAT scissors....sharp, great for crafts!!!",5
B0006842S2,As Described!,5
B0006842S2,Love these scissors!  They cut in very small places and are definitely the best precision cutting scissors I've tried. They stay sharp longer than most other small scissors I've tried - I appreciate that so much.,5
B0006842S2,"Perfect size to carry when traveling to retreat. Light weight and doesn't take up much room. Arrived in new, perfect condition.",5
B0006842S2,EXCELLENT little scissor with the tip guard.  Tips are super sharp.  Have purchased other EK tools products and have never been disappointed.,5
B0006842S2,"Great craft scissors -- blades are sharp, very sharp points, precise for cutting fine areas and small details.",5
B0006842S2,"Nice sharp point, making these scissors great for fussy or cutting small fine cutting areas.",5
B0006842S2,SAFETY COVER STAYS ON VERY WELL,5
B0006842S2,I love these Cutter Bee precision cut scissors and have a couple of pairs from many years ago. They became dull from constant use. So I purchased new here bcz i cant find this specific set in stores anymore. Item is new in package and are very sharp. Packaged well. Arrived on time as estimated. I'm pleased with my purchase.,5
B0006842S2,"These are the perfect size for travel, to keep in the bathroom  and for wrapping gifts.  I love the size and the color of them.  And I love that they come with a bright yellow cover, so I can find them easily in the drawer.",5
B0006842S2,These scissors are cute and feel like they are well made. They're sharp and small enough for finer cuts.,5
B0006842S2,Happy collating! Perfect for small details. Great portability,5
B0006842S2,Using this for paper crafters,4
B0006842S2,"I am 66 years old and these are, by far, the best scissors I've ever used for crafting! One of my favorite crafts is working with paper. Mostly making flowers. I don't know why, but I am pretty much incapable of cutting straight. Even when I trace/draw lines! With these scissors, I'm able to cut so much straighter. Even going around curves. Awesome!",5
B0006842S2,"I use them for paper, cardboard, packing tape, and they are sharp enough to be used on harder substances. They also come with a safety case that snaps on and stays on, which I love since I store them in a fabric couch pocket. I lost mine and just had to order another pair, as they are very inexpensive. Well-done.",5
B0006842S2,"I don't usually review products because I buy so many I would have to spend an hour every day submitting sincere reviews. But every so often a product this good comes along and I am compelled to say something. I bought these to use in learning Japanese paper cutting art, so I am new to this. After five minutes I was using these scissors like I had been using them for years. They can almost read my mind, and using them is as intuitive as using my very own fingers or hands. If you are looking for something like that--buy these!",5
B0006842S2,They are very sharp and great for fussy cutting.  Bits of glue or tape do not stick to them.,5
B0006842S2,"'Ive used these for years, first for scrapbooking and now for quilting. You simply can't find a better pair of scissors for small intricate projects. Just keep them away from others, they are super sharp!",5
B0006842S2,These little scissors are perfect for cutting small things. Use for die cutting intricate paper designs. Have another pair that have had for lots of years. Could not find them so ordered another pair.,5
B0006842S2,"It is a scrapbooking law that every crafter must have a pair of Cutter Bees. It just is. But these small scissors can be hard to keep track of.  Back in the day when you would go to a crop, everyone had these identical scissors and you would have to wear them on a leash to prevent someone else from accidentally taking yours. This was my third time buying a pair because I couldn't find mine and assumed a recent scrapbooking partner had abducted them, and I didn't want to violate the law by not having them at hand. Recently a long-lost pair emerged and now I have twins. But I still wonder where that third pair ended up.",5
B0006842S2,These are some sharp little scissors. Perfect size and fit well in my hand. Highly recommend.,5
B0006842S2,"If you do detailed cutting and need to get around very tiny areas, THESE ARE THE PAIR OF SCISSORS YOU NEED! Love them!!!",5
B0006842S2,Good points,5
B0006842S2,"I only ordered these because they have a cover, and I wanted to put them in my travel Bullet Journal kit for an upcoming road trip. Based on their tiny size and relatively low price, I was expecting ""kid"" scissors, but THESE ARE AWESOMELY SHARP! Much, much better quality than I expected, and the cover does exactly what I needed it to do. Probably going to order at least one more pair of these to stash everywhere I might need scissors.",5
B0006842S2,Sharp and so easy to use. I am going to order agZin,5
B0006842S2,seeing a lot of use,5
B0006842S2,I love these scissors for precision cutting. The blades are sharp and the scissors are very maneuverable. I do a lot of fussy cutting and  I have bought numerous pairs of these scissors for over the past ten years and the quality is still top notch.,5
B0006842S2,"I like these scissors for cutting into corners, and small delicate items.This is perfect for card making and scrapbooking.",5
B0006842S2,I have been using the same model of scissors for years so ordering another brand/style of scissors was a bit of a reach for me- scissor-wise. If you always use the same scissor and might need a couple of days to adjust to these but you will be rewarded for your effort with lovely crisp clean cutting.I ordered ordered 2 more parts - not because these lost their sharpness just because I like to have a pair in a number of rooms in my house not just the art room.,5
B0006842S2,These are sharp and convenient for crafts and travel,5
B0006842S2,"These Cutter Bee scissors were recommended on a YouTube video for those who do ""fussy cutting.""  They truly are the best fussy cutting scissors I have, and I always reach for them first when I'm cutting out something very small and detailed.  I have used them for cutting out paper only, and they never disappoint.",5
B0006842S2,They work great at works,5
B0006842S2,I used to love these scissors and raved about them to everyone but the last two I bought were not the same quality. They used to stay sharp for years. Now it's dull within a few months. And the most recent pair has sharp edges on the yellow finger holes. It's literally irritating my skin when I try to use them. I cannot recommend them. I am giving three stars for nostalgia.,3
B0006842S2,They work great for fussy cutting and the bright yellow color makes them easy to find on my cluttered desk!,5
B0006842S2,I am planning to use them for my card making. Hope they are easy to move around.,5
B0006842S2,I love them,5
B0006842S2,My headline says it all.  They are WAY sharper than my considerable more expensive small scissors.  I use them to cut right up to but not through seam lines.  My only concern is how long will they stay this shape.  Hopefully will not dull overly quickly but I will adjust my review if they do.,5
B0006842S2,"Very useful,nice size and with the security case!",5
B0006842S2,"I use these scissors fir paracord projects, and boy are they sharp. They work for cutting paracord and for precision cuts, too. Better than all other craft scissors I've used before. Just the perfect size and comes with a protective cover. Great price and delivered quickly. I will recommend to others.",5
B0006842S2,"I've bought this brand in store before and they were great, very sharp, very precise, but the ones I received here were defective, criss-crossed at the tips. I returned them. Normally Cutter-Bee are a very high quality product. I've bought several pair, not because they wear out but because I either abuse or lose them. Might have just been a fluke.",3
B0006842S2,Extremely sharp. Use caution,5
B0006842S2,these scissors are small but mighty and super sharp (not for kids). I have one on my work table and 1 in my satchel. There is a cover for the very sharp blades that you will be happy for. The bright yellow color makes them easy to see among craft supplies which to me who seems to spend my life looking for things. They are a good thing.,5
B0006842S2,"I like to do paper-crafting (making cards, junk journals, scrapbooking) as well as sewing. I have tried a LOT of small scissors, including higher priced, name brand ones. I was looking for small scissors to use for ""fussy cutting"" ..... the cutting out of intricate pictures (such as flowers with leaves and stems). I'm pleased to say, I am LOVING these Cutter Bee ones!They are very sharp, and have a great, pointed tip. They are strong, and I have not had any trouble with them collecting sticky residue when used for things like Washi Tap. My only ""complaint"" is the size of the finger / thumb holes. They could be a little larger for a more comfortable hold. My hubby, for example, with large hands, can't use these scissors well as his fingers don't fit the handle holes.**This is actually a good thing if you want a deterant from your larger-handed spouse or others, ""stealing"" your best scissors LOL **The scissors are long enough to cut lengths without it taking a zillion snips, but compact enough that they are awesome for that fussy cutting work. Strong but lightweight; sharp, pivot well .... and comes with a bonus cover to put over the point. I highly recommend these scissors to all crafters, but especially anyone doing fine, or detailed paper cutting!",5
B0006842S2,Works really well for cutting fine details,5
B0006842S2,"Love these. So sharp, so precise, perfect size for my hands. I use them for cutting in my book folding projects.",5
B0006842S2,Me agradaron. Son muy buenas para cortar diversos materiales.,5
B0006842S2,I wasn't sure if I'd like these scissors or not because they are so small. But they are great!! They are super sharp and I can cut with just the tip when I need to unlike most of the scissors I already have. GREAT quality & I like the little protector that can be placed over the blades.  I would definitely buy them again.,5
B0006842S2,I bought my first pair of Cutter Bee Precision Scissors close to 19 years ago. They finally wore out. This is the replacement. I am an avid crafter and use these almost everyday. Buy them....you won't be sorry!!,5
B0006842S2,Just the right size for ''fussy cutting'' small paper items for journals.  Will help in making sharp and precise cuts.,5
B0006842S2,These are smaller and fit my hand very well.  Like that there is a protective cap because the tips are very sharp.  The blades are sharp too. They fit nicely in the drawer & the price was great.  I like everything about this and would highly recommend.,5
B0006842S2,Very sharp and easy to use!,5
B0006842S2,This is my second pair lost my other pair.  Couldn't  be without one.,5
B0006842S2,"Easy to maneuver on small tight cuts or on straight ones, very sharp.I've used these just a few times and they are excellent and glad I decided to purchase.My only issue is that the little cover to protect the blades formed a split radiating from the hole, from taking it off and putting it on.  After awile I'm not expecting it to stay in place or maybe will break completely. I  feel the blade cover is optional, but will continue to use it.",4
B0006842S2,These are off the chart!!! Get them!!!,5
B0006842S2,"Sharpness, small.",5
B0006842S2,This is my second pair.  I can't recommend these scissors enough.  Small and portable with a protective case.  Easy to travel with.  Sharp and accurate.  Highly recommend.,5
B0006842S2,"These have been a great asset to my miniature kits! I tried using a craft knife, but really struggled to get nice clean cuts. So happy I upgraded to these from craft knives and school scissors. There's no going back.",5
B0006842S2,Needed to use to trim the lace front on my new wig.  Saw them on YouTube.  They work great.,5
B0006842S2,Comfortable to use and sharp!,5
B0006842S2,They work excellent for cutting material!!,5
B0006842S2,"I like the cover on the scissors, I can pack it with travel gear.  It is also sharp and compact.",5
B0006842S2,These are my favorite scissors! I probably have at least 6 pairs in all rooms of the house and even a pair at work and in my traveling craft kit. These are sharp and are even good for fussy cutting stamps or even just with paper crafting in general.,5
B0006842S2,Perfect little size for detailed trimming around small pattern pieces.  And they are extremely sharp,5
B0006842S2,"Very good product, works as advertised, worth the money.",5
B0006842S2,"I've heard so many people rave about these and I don't know why . The only thing I could think of is these are not genuine ones or they are just weird on my long, thin fingers. They were painful to use and didn't have good maneuverability. They were slightly dull and just not what I expected.",3
B0006842S2,"From the tip to the base, only cuts on the tip, and not that great. I use all other scissors I can find first.",2
B0006842S2,Love my honey bee scissors,5
B0006842S2,I use these scissors for fussy cutting ...which is the small cutting of different things.  I really like them and they fit my hand very well.  I know a lot of people who love them.  Worth getting.,5
B0006842S2,These are the best scissors for fussy cuts.  They are sharp and work very well.,5
B0006842S2,"Many of the reviews said this Cutter Bee is NOT the same ""original"" one (althoughit says ""the original"" on the package. I asked a question about whether this cut clean at the tip, which mean it doesn't leave a tiny tear on the paper. I did not get a clear answer, so I decided to give it a try. UNFORTUNATELY, the one I got DOES make that tiny tear! Maybe it's just me being picky but to me, it's important to have an ABSOLUTE CLEAN cut at the TIP when it comes to fussy cutting. Otherwise, it is a good pair of scissors.",4
B0006842S2,"For years I have seen people who fussy cut and said that Cutter Bees were the best ones on the market for it. I finally have now tried them, and it is true! You can get into the tight little places and easily maneuver around small pieces. From now on, I will be one to tell people the same thing. They are the best I have tried for fussy cutting.",5
B0006842S2,My sister likes these scissors a lot. They are a compact size to be handy. Comes with a cover to use over the cutting part when not in use. They are smooth too use for smaller things.,5
B0006842S2,"I've been using these scissors for years. I have noticed the tip is not as pointed as my first original pair but still a good quality product, they seem to hold up thru the hell I put them through. They cut all types of paper, cardstock, thin cardboard but never glitter paper, I think that may dull the blades on new scissors I have an older pair for this type of paper. Couldn't beat the price on these. Happy crafter right now!",5
B0006842S2,I loved my cutter bees and was heartbroken when they disappeared. So happy I could replace them!,5
B0006842S2,Best product for my fussy cutting,5
B0006842S2,Very sharp,5
B0006842S2,I use it for exact cutting and it's easy to maneuver.,5
B0006842S2,"Great product, price, shipping, communication, packaging.  Highly recommend",5
B07TYRBR83,I have an Air Explorer 2 & they do not have the engraving option. This tip works with my Explorer & I've been engraving Christmas ornaments with it. The directions comes with the tip to tell you how to load it & what settings to use. So easy to use. The results from using the tool & the price are amazing! I am thrilled over this find!,5
B07TYRBR83,Works like a charm.,5
B07TYRBR83,This fit our Cricut perfect.  Used to engrave aluminum business cards.  Worked perfectly and cards turned out great.,5
B07TYRBR83,A high quality part at an excellent dale price at $24.99,5
B07TYRBR83,"I finally bit the bullet and got the engraving tip, and it was worth it. I haven't engraved acrylic yet, I want to try that next, but this tip is perfect for dog tags! I bought some military ones and some bone shaped ones. Both engraved nicely. I feel like blockier lines engrave on the metal better than round or swirly ones do.Cricut Maker 3 recognized the tip and housing perfectly. I just changed the cut lines to engraving lines in design space once the engraving housing was swapped out with the blade housing.",5
B07TYRBR83,"This is probably one of my favorite tools for my Cricut maker 3, I  love that I can make ornaments for my family and friends for xmas,as well as other things I haven't tried yet",4
B07TYRBR83,as advertised.  would recommend,5
B07TYRBR83,"I purchased this engraving tip for my Cricut Maker to engrave into leather. I have only tried it out once and honestly I need a little more practice using it. However, it works as expected and did a decent job. Any deficiencies were in my own inexperience with adhering the targeted leather piece to the mat to prevent slippage, and this was not the fault of the product, only a need for practice on the part of the user. Therefore, I am pleased with the quality of the tip itself and hope to be able to find more time to do it justice.",5
B07TYRBR83,"As stated, it works as expected.",5
B07TYRBR83,I bought this for my daughter.  It was exactly what she wanted.  It arrived really fast.,5
B07TYRBR83,It didnt work for my cricut maker.,5
B07TYRBR83,Bueno.,5
B07TYRBR83,"Used to engrave on acrylic for anniversary picture frame. Did a great job. Did use a ""fill file"" to fill in more of the cut which can be found online. Like that I can use the adapter for other Cricut tips.",5
B07TYRBR83,"Found an engraving project I really wanted to try and justified buying the engraving tool to make a nightlight as a gift. This Cricut tool was a fantastic price,  arrived next day and worked like a charm without having to recalibrate my Maker. Really excited to enjoy more engraving projects.",5
B07TYRBR83,Works perfectly,5
B07TYRBR83,Prompt shipping. Good product.,5
B07TYRBR83,"I wanted to make one of those awesome acrylic night lights, as well as engrave stainless steel bracelets (I have a bunch already from metal stamping). I watched a couple of videos--Jennifer Maker is super helpful. Used painter's tape to secure the acrylic to my mat, hit start & held my breath.... WOW.  I couldn't believe it came out perfect on my first try!  And it was faster than expected.  If you choose to do a project like this, just remember to use 2 mm acrylic.  I bought the LED light stands & the 2 mm acrylic separately, as most stands that come with acrylic include 4 mm acrylic.  The acrylic leans just a little, but it makes no difference.  Beautiful!  The bracelet came out nice, too.  Very happy with this tip! (Excuse the fingerprints on the edge of my acrylic there...)",5
B07TYRBR83,This was a gift but they loved it,5
B07TYRBR83,"It is Cricut brand, of course it works as expected!",5
B07TYRBR83,Bought it but have not used it yet,5
B07TYRBR83,Happy with purchase,5
B07TYRBR83,Excelente.,5
B07TYRBR83,"The product is OK, but I would like to know the tool's condition upfront. Whether new, used, or otherwise.",3
B07TYRBR83,As described. Works like it should.,4
B07TYRBR83,Great product,5
B07TYRBR83,Excelente,5
B07TYRBR83,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love how easy it is to use.  Literally unpacked it and popped it in. This was my first engraving experience and it turned out exactly as I'd hoped.  I engraved acrylic to create the illusion of glass tile for my dollhouse shower (it's a work in progress, so you'll have to use your imagination for now).",5
B07TYRBR83,This tool worked very well with my Cricut maker. I used it on some aluminum bracket blanks. Very clear engraving. Love the quick swap housing too.,5
B07TYRBR83,I decided to try the engraving blade on my cricket maker. I went to one of the local big box stores and got a thin piece of brass plated aluminum and decided to try to make a engraved sign out of it. I think it came out wonderful it took about 15 minutes to complete the process. I recommend this to anybody that wants to try to engrave into metal.,5
B07TYRBR83,This tip came just in time for me to get some of my Christmas presents created and ready for the recipients.,5
B07TYRBR83,Item came in new condition and works for its intended use.,5
B07TYRBR83,Reasonable price. Shipped fast. Would buy again if needed.,5
B07TYRBR83,Works great no issues,5

B07TYRBR83,Works great on the projects I use it for,5
B07TYRBR83,Great price too,4
B07TYRBR83,Works as it should,5
B07TYRBR83,Another tool for my cricut at a great price,5
B07TYRBR83,This is much cheaper than cricut online. I had a lot of fun engraving with it for my first time.,5
B07TYRBR83,This is a REAL Cricut engraving tip - not one of those cheap knock-offs made to look like a Cricut blade that you have to watch out for. It arrived quickly (several days sooner than expected) in the original Cricut packaging. It works great and is also priced well! I'll definitely be purchasing any future Cricut blades from this seller!,5
B07TYRBR83,"I received the full hour ssd's ing and tip.  Some reviewers stated they only received the tip.  You need to ensure to select the correct item.  Great value and much less expensive than on the actual website.  Genuine article, not some generic brand.",5

B07TYRBR83,Engraves beautifully! Very simple and very effective!,5
B07TYRBR83,I've had it for less than 24hrs and I've already engraved a few thing.. I really like it. Engraving was the main reason I went with the maker vs the air. Can't wait to build my skills up here,5
B07TYRBR83,Was extremely happy with this product not only is it authentic the price for the blade was cheaper then anywhere else I have checked in store or online.  I will be buying from this seller for sure again in the future.,5
B07TYRBR83,It is pretty good I tried with cricut maker,5
B07TYRBR83,Thank you so much. Easy to Use. Worth the money. Great value. Great Product. Definitely will Recommend and Buy Again. Highly recommended.,5
B07TYRBR83,Mine came with both housing and tip and in original cricut packaging and works beautifully,5
B07TYRBR83,"Great product! It was easy to switch out. In addition, if you already have the casing/house just buy tips !",4
B07TYRBR83,Product arrived and had been opened and taped closed.  The gears on the cutting wheel had worn through the cricut package.  There was no damage to the package it was delivered in.  This looks to be a used engraving tip.,1
B07TYRBR83,great price and arrived quickly,5
B07TYRBR83,Sadly i never got to see what wonderful things the engraving tip could doz.  Because  it was stolen off the porch. Before i could even gaze upon its majestic mechanical wonders!,3
B07TYRBR83,Cricut version with quick change housing. Great value as i have seen these extremely high in price. So glad i went with this one. Great product with awesome price!,5

B07TYRBR83,Use this with my Cricut maker! I love the ability to engrave.,5
B07TYRBR83,I purchased this for engraving on acrylic and anodized aluminum. So far I've used it on acrylic sheets and it has performed very well.,5
B07TYRBR83,"Item is as advertised, great feature is the quick connect option that allows for fast servicing of the equipment.",5
B07TYRBR83,It took a long time to get this blade because everyone was out. It works great just love it.,5
B07TYRBR83,Still experimenting with this tool on thinner leather projects. It embossed and debosses too. Works with my Cricut Maker.,5
B07TYRBR83,Couldn't find this for cheaper anywhere else. I'm very excited to try this out soon. :),5
B07TYRBR83,Cricut Maker 3 machine does not recognize the housing. Online says to clean it but does not work,1

B07TYRBR83,Great product,5
B07TYRBR83,Use with my new cricket maker 3,5

B01AW5V7PE,"Very good quality sketchbook, the size is suitable and the paper is thick. My sons love to draw on them. We love Melissa & Doug products",5
B01AW5V7PE,We love this brand and are happy with this product,5
B01AW5V7PE,It was a gift I think she love it,5
B01AW5V7PE,Would buy again,5
B01AW5V7PE,daughter loves to dream great price for the pack,5
B01AW5V7PE,These are perfectly fine. It's a pad of paper so I'm not sure really how to rate it against another pad  of paper.,4
B01AW5V7PE,Great for Littles,5
B01AW5V7PE,I got these as a gift for my grandson. He is drawing more and his skills are growing. The paper is great quality and light weight. The sketch pads are just the perfect size for beginners no matter what the age.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Grand daughters like these,5
B01AW5V7PE,"The product came damaged on the corner, but the kids did not notice. The paper quality is perfect for kids and toddlers.",3
B01AW5V7PE,Been buying this paper for crafts and art for years. Great quality!,5
B01AW5V7PE,Excelente,5
B01AW5V7PE,"These are great for making my kids art projects for keeping track of them, and travel.",5
B01AW5V7PE,These were for my Granddaughter who is always looking to draw.  These sketch pads keep her busy,5
B01AW5V7PE,"Nice large size, durable paper",5
B01AW5V7PE,The kids love drawing in these!,5
B01AW5V7PE,Drawing and painting,5
B01AW5V7PE,My 6 year old son loves to draw and I have bought these 3 years in a row now. We absolutely love them and will be purchasing more here soon!,5
B01AW5V7PE,Good,5
B01AW5V7PE,Average quality,4
B01AW5V7PE,My kids loved these plain notebooks. They lasted a long time!,5
B01AW5V7PE,Great product grandkids love them,5
B01AW5V7PE,"My 6 year old granddaughter loves to draw and when she does her 3 year old brother wants to draw also, so this 3 pack definitely came in handy. Will keep buying!",5
B01AW5V7PE,quality paper,5
B01AW5V7PE,We got this as part of a larger gift.  Love the number of pads included in this set.  My granddaughters eyes let up when she saw all the blank drawing paper.,5
B01AW5V7PE,The kids are always asking for paper to draw on and this package of tablets certainly fills the bill.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Good for our drawer,5
B01AW5V7PE,I bought it for my grand grand daughter she like to paint and loves it,5
B01AW5V7PE,I bought it for my 9-year-old nephew for Christmas along w/pencils.  He is quite the artist and loved this!,5
B01AW5V7PE,Granddaughter had fun drawing,4
B01AW5V7PE,My grandchildren loves to draw and this keeps them from using my computer paper.  I will definitely buy again,5
B01AW5V7PE,I always make sure to keep these in stock at my house for my grandkids. They love them! The paper it thick and sturdy. Works for painting too!,5
B01AW5V7PE,My 5 year old uses these with her color pencils and loves to draw on them.,5
B01AW5V7PE,The paper was a little pricey but good quality comes at a price. I purchased this drawing paper as a gift for my 7 year old granddaughter that loves to draw. The only downside of this paper was when she used marker it came through on the sheets of paper next to the previous one where she was drawing.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Lots of good paper for a good price.,5
B01AW5V7PE,I have an eight year old grandson who loves to draw - and these work great. You get 3 spiral ringed tablets.  Sometimes he leaves them in - sometimes he tears his art out to give as gifts.  These are great.,5
B01AW5V7PE,"I got a different brand but decided to try this one since I am familiar with the brand. Very disappointing, papers are much thinner. You do get a lot of pages but I will not rebuy this again.",3
B01AW5V7PE,Great for drawing and sketching.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Just what was ordered,5
B01AW5V7PE,Bought these pads for my Three-Year-Old granddaughter.  I was afraid when I opened the package and studied the paper it would be too thin for the washable markers I included with my gift.  Much to my surprise there is no bleed-through.,5
B01AW5V7PE,I give these to my Grandchildren every Christmas and I keep one for me seeing it comes in. 3 pack,4
B01AW5V7PE,I bought the three pack so I'd have one for each grandchild. The pad is sturdy enough for my the grandchild  who loves to draw quickly and tear out pages to give to people for their refrigerators;  and it's great for my artistic grandchild who likes to sit down and show you her work in her art book.  The other child frequently erases to make changes on plans for toys or rocket ships. The paper holds up to these erasers.,5
B01AW5V7PE,To thin.  Regular old computer paper is just as good if not better. Would love a pad of larger and thicker paper!,3
B01AW5V7PE,Just what my granddaughter needed for her drawing. She's 5 and loves to draw. The cover comes undone from the glue when you flip it open. All the pages as still glued and useable.,4
B01AW5V7PE,nice,5
B01AW5V7PE,"I bought these for my great niece to use:  she loves arts and crafts and goes through a LOT of paper!  They are a good size for her to create big pictures, but then can also be cut up as needed. She does some water color painting and the paper seems to hold up well to that.Great value for the price,  will definitely buy more soon.",5
B01AW5V7PE,"There wasn't anything wrong with these, but I thought the paper would be thicker or a little more durable, but it really is no better than paper you would use for printing, like computer paper. For the price, you can get a 500 pack of computer paper....versus the 150 sheets here. Now, if you want your toddler to use a pad, that's another story. However, the pages tear out/off the pad super easily, so if you have a toddler as young as mine (she is about to turn 2) she would tear every page out anyway and color a couple marks on each page. So I have been tearing out a few pages at at time and letting her go crazy on those, versus giving her the whole pad. I wish I had just gotten computer paper.I would recommend it, but buyer beware on what you are purchasing and that you can get more for your money elsewhere.",3
B01AW5V7PE,I've got some artists in my house who love to draw. We stay stocked up on these pads so they don't use all my printer paper. Good quality.,5
B01AW5V7PE,"These drawing pads with purchased to go with an art box full of crayons, markers, chalk, watercolors, colored pencils, and pastels in a wonderful wooden box.  How do you use all those picture makers without paper to color on?  With several pads of this paper, a lot of art can be made from the creative mind of a fifth grader who loves art.",5
B01AW5V7PE,I'd say that the only warning is that the markers my DD used bleed through the paper. But other than that it served its purpose.,5
B01AW5V7PE,"I wanted to get my kids some drawing paper so they could learn to draw with colored pencils and have the freedom to erase but since this is as lightweight as copy paper, my kids were super frustrated wrinkling the paper when they erased even a little bit. No value in this since we already have copy paper.",2
B01AW5V7PE,Very great quality.  good paper.  Easy to tear off a page if want to.  3 tablets total included.  I recommend using washable markers as it did bleed thru onto a table if heavy repeated use in one spot for drawing. Wiped off instantly on a glass surface.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Nice sketching pad for kids.  Great price for 3 pads of paper.  My grandson loves to draw ... this paper is a nice weight  ... doesn't tear easily ... and it's a nice bright white.,5
B01AW5V7PE,"It as a gift for grandkids, they used it up, liked and enjoyed it.",5
B01AW5V7PE,My 7 year old loves blank paper more than coloring books so these are perfect!,5
B01AW5V7PE,"It's discouraging that a "" kid friendly "" company would charge so much for drawing paper FOR KIDS.My grandkids go through these pads so fast but I just can't afford this anymore because the price has increased so much.",3
B01AW5V7PE,He loved having his Progression from one page to the other,5
B01AW5V7PE,"This was such a great deal!! I have 3 girls that LOVE to draw and doodle. This was perfect! Not only is it available in a pack of 3, the price was phenomenal! I am buying this again! Great great deal! Thank you Melissa & Doug for always providing such exceptional products!",5
B01AW5V7PE,These are perfect for pairing with an art kit!!! My granddaughters love drawing pictures!!!,5
B01AW5V7PE,"The paper is very white, smooth. got it for the kids, but I would use it myself.",5
B01AW5V7PE,"We used it with markers, color pencils, and even watercolor (not recommended though)",5
B01AW5V7PE,Combined it with papermate flair pens as a gift. Good combo.,5
B01AW5V7PE,"Sturdy paper, even for a 2 year old who scribbles hard.",5
B01AW5V7PE,"This is a great value, as my kids go thru a lot of paper drawing all of the time. I will be buying more packs.",5
B01AW5V7PE,Good gift for young person who enjoys drawing and coloring,5
B01AW5V7PE,"This 3 pack is a pretty great value considering it is also shipped with Prime for free. My daughter goes through them fairly quickly since she is a budding artist. I am debating adding this to my Subscribe and Save items. You can check out my instagram, @momazondotcom for more insights and reviews from an Amazon addicted family!",5
B01AW5V7PE,Beautifully crafted I like the dimmer and 3 alarm settings.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Quality of paper is great  and very durable,5
B01AW5V7PE,"Great drawing paper, rips out easily. Definitely just drawing paper tho - tried our hand with paints and it destroyed the paper so fast",5
B01AW5V7PE,Made for a great gift,5
B01AW5V7PE,Purchased for my nieces who love to draw,5
B01AW5V7PE,"My 3 1/2 year old son likes to use markers and colored pencils to draw.  We had purchased paper from Ikea, but the pack includes colored paper as well as white paper.  We used a lot more of the white paper, bought this as an alternative. It does not compare in quality. It is very thin, the color bleeds through and it it hard for my son to tear the paper off himself.  The paper is thin, so the page ends up ripping.  It's not terrible paper, but we prefer the Ikea paper",3
B01AW5V7PE,"These are perfect for grandkids to create their artwork.  Other than that, don't know that I have anything with which to compare!",5
B01AW5V7PE,Second time I have given these tablets to my grandkids for Christmas.  They are always glad to get more drawing paper.  They both use lots of paper and this paper is thick enough to stand up to even markers.,5
B01AW5V7PE,I bought this for my young granddaughter who is a budding artist and she loves drawing and of course as she goes through a lot of paper so this was a tremendous deal for her her,5
B01AW5V7PE,"My local art store is out of affordable sturdy paper for children, so I tried this for a time sensitive birthday gift. Good stuff, arrived promptly.",5
B01AW5V7PE,My granddaughter draws and uses markers all the time could see markers on back of the page a no bleeding on this paper great price,5
B01AW5V7PE,"I thought I'd gotten the M&D pads before, and they had been okay. Not great, but okay. If so, these are not the same. If very thin sheets will work for you, these may not be a bad deal. Personally, I won't even use copy paper this thin for everyday printing. I can imagine how well this flimsy paper will hold up to markers. Or paints, gods forbid.Either look around for heavier-bond paper, or let the kids grab sheets out of the printer tray, it won't be any thinner than what's in these pads.",3
B01AW5V7PE,I purchased this and a few other things for a great-nephew for Christmas. He loves to draw and color and play with Play-Doh. I think I hit all the bases.,5
B01AW5V7PE,The 7 year old girl and her mom were so happy with this gift! She loves to draw and it kept her busy while Grandmom was watching her over Christmas break!  Great way to encourage creativity and imagination!,5
B01AW5V7PE,This is great craft paper and there are so many sheets. I will definitely buy again.,5
B01AW5V7PE,Good value,5
B01AW5V7PE,"Perfect drawing pad for my youngest granddaughter, she enjoyed creating her own pictures.",5
B01AW5V7PE,"This is not heavy weight at all. You can see how thin the paper is if you look at the picture, you can see outline of my hand underneath the sheet. I would not recommend this paper for painting or using markers. I was expecting something a bit thicker.",2
B01AW5V7PE,This is the third or fourth time I have bought this set and each time it remains steadfast for its purpose. It is a decent size for drawing etc.,5
B001687ZDA,Great value for money. Easy to use. Sticks well and able to sew through without any gumming up of the machine. Great brand!,5
B001687ZDA,Used it for applique' fabrics to other fabrics. Helps keep the applique pieces from fraying.,5
B001687ZDA,"This product adheres one fabric to another fabric.  To use, trace the outline onto the paper side of the product and then adhere with a hot iron.  The paper is not difficult to peel off.  The shape is then cut out and adhered to the background fabric.  This is useful for applique which will be stitched down; the adhesion is light.  This would also work for applying patches with the caveat that the patch be stitched down after application.",5
B001687ZDA,"Great, quality, weight just right for my projects, and will buy it again and again.",5
B001687ZDA,"I create a lot of various machine appliques for quilting projects and other projects and do find that using this product makes the tasks so much easier and more enjoyably fun.  There is no problem with the fusible getting onto the iron and the fabric has the same drape quality.  Pieces are machine washable and always look fabulous!  Different sizes are available, but I find the 5.25 yard x 17"" allows you to create lots of appliques for the money!  Pricing is best through Amazon and shipping is quick.",5
B001687ZDA,"I used this to add letters onto a quilt I was making. It was easy to use and made the letters stay in place while I stitched around them. There is also a lot on the roll, so it will be useful for several more projects as well.",5
B001687ZDA,"Good instructions, easy to use.",5
B001687ZDA,"I bought this based on a tutorial I read online for sewing appliques on stretchy fabric. I wasn't sure I was going to need/use it right away, but with Halloween coming up, I figured it couldn't hurt to have this on hand.Fast forward over a month and my daughter said she wanted a Wonder Woman costume. I sat down with the fabric, and a printed copy of the Wonder Woman logo and tried to figure out how I was going to sew the gold logo on the front of her costume, keeping everything aligned correctly. After a discussion with my boyfriend that included him asking if I thought I could glue it on (no, a glue stick wouldn't hold on spandex), I remembered I had the Heat'n Bond. I dug it out, read the instructions and figured I'd give it a try.I first used an iron-on stabilizer on the right side of the gold spandex material. I'd traced the Wonder Woman onto the iron-on stabilizer. Then, I cut along the outside outline of the logo. Next, I ironed the first side of the Heat'n Bond on the back of the logo, then I carefully cut out each of the logo pieces. I even cut out the inner line piece carefully (where the red shows on the photo) and saved that. I peeled the paper back off the Heat'n Bond for the four pieces that make up the logo. I placed all the pieces on the red top, including the inner line piece, as that helped the other pieces keep their places (I left the paper back on that piece, as I didn't want to use that one.) I followed the directions and lightly pressed the pieces onto the red top. I removed the inner line piece and the logo was perfectly placed! I then sewed the applique logo in place. The picture shows the logo as it looks finished.Without the Heat'n Bond, I wouldn't have been able to recreate the Wonder Woman logo for my daughter's Halloween costume. It bonded the two pieces of spandex fabric together so I could sew the logo in place. This version of Heat'n Bond is the ""lite"" version. It is meant to bond two pieces of lighter weight fabric, and from my reading and research, most people do sew on top of the Heat'n Bond. They do make a heavier version that is for more heavy duty applications.",5
B001687ZDA,"Quick shipping, well packaged, excellent product",5
B001687ZDA,Easy to use and it doesn't gum up my needle.,5
B001687ZDA,Used with a quilting project for applique. Held the fabric in place well.,5
B001687ZDA,I'm using this for applique.  I am stitching each piece as I go because I expect the items I am making to be frequently washed.  My sewing machine has no problems with this product.,5
B001687ZDA,Works,5
B001687ZDA,Regular purchase,5
B001687ZDA,Wife says it is good at a good price at the time of purchase.,5
B001687ZDA,I purchased this product to do some applique.  It worked as indicated and the results are perfect.  I would purchase this again.,5
B001687ZDA,Work perfectly with my cutter.,5
B001687ZDA,Fabric-like. Perfect for machine sewing because doesn't have a thick layer of glue as other ones have,5
B001687ZDA,"This Heat n Bond Lite is easy to use.  Press with dry iron the bumpy side to the wrong side of your fabric, remove paper to reveal glossy side, position on background fabric, press with dry iron to activate glue, and machine topstitch applique edges to reduce fraying.  Easy!",5
B001687ZDA,An important tool for machine embroidery applique. Easy to use and keeps fabric stable. I will buy again.,5
B001687ZDA,Just what I wanted!,5
B001687ZDA,"This adhesive makes adding fabric application so easy.  This is a picture of a denim quilt with pockets that have felt, wool and cotton fabric used to iron them to the denim and then sew in place by hand.  Just iron the adhesive to the back of the piece of fabric, then take the backing off and add you flower etc where ever you plan to sew it on.  Like I did ironed it onto the denim and and the little wool circles too. Then hand sewed them in place!  It is a great product.",5
B001687ZDA,"I've used HeatnBond before, which is a great product. My local fabric store and hobby store charges a bit more for a smaller quantity, so when I saw these on Amazon, I decided to grab it and pop it in my supplies cabinet. That way, I will have more than enough for a future project!",5
B001687ZDA,"I love this stuff!!!  This product comes in a roll.  To use, you unroll and cut whatever portion you need for your project and roll back up and store in the plastic bag it came in. There are clear directions on how to use this product. I use it for applique projects on my quilts. After you iron the product onto your fabric, set aside and let cool before using. Sometimes I iron the product on several selections of different fabric and place in my sewing room for future use. Then when I need it, I pull it out and draw a pattern on the fabric with the heat'n bond already in place.  I then cut out the pattern, peel away the outer portion of the product, and iron it on another piece of fabric, according to the manufacturers directions, and then WOW!!! This product  is a must have for every sewing room. I have even used it to repair a pair of slacks to repair a small that would  have otherwise been distorted if sewn together using a needle and thread.",5
B001687ZDA,Dry mount watercolor to half fold cardstock greeting card,5
B001687ZDA,This is easy to use and adheres well. I used it on my felt items and it worked great. I was a little worried about it working but I had no trouble.,5
B001687ZDA,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It bonds the applique really well. Confident it won't move while stitching.,4
B001687ZDA,I didn't like,4
B001687ZDA,"Great for appliques. Not too good for napkins. I wanted a quick way to make cotton napkins without having to sew them.. I use a LOT of napkins and  wanted to wash only once a week or so. I ordered the lite and the heavier version. Glad I started with the light, then tested, by washing and drying. The adhesion was okay, some loosened, threads came out, but were usable. However, the kids and I  thought it a bit too hard. So went on line to see how to remove... Not hard to remove but wasted the money. Not the fault of the product. I had read reviews that it was not hard as in soft after applying...hmmm",5
B001687ZDA,Good,4
B001687ZDA,Good addition to my sewing supplies.,5
B001687ZDA,"I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local libraries, and quite a few of them involve layers of fabric or fabric die-cuts.  The teacher who showed us how to make fabric cards recommended Heat'n Bond Lite Iron-on Adhesive to layer the fabric onto our card stock, and I've been using it ever since.  It doesn't add any bulk to the card, and the only tools you need are your scissors, iron, and ironing board.  I also use a  June Tailor Non Stick Pressing Sheet 18x18""        to keep the adhesive from sticking to my iron and ironing board cover.Please see customer image for an example of a fabric card that I made with this Thermoweb Heat'n Bond Lite Iron-on Adhesive.",5
B001687ZDA,Love this for all my applique jobs. The light is so light that it does not make the applique heavy but sturdy enough so that is sticks very nicely. My sewing machine loves the lightness as well.,5
B001687ZDA,This is the greatest invention since sliced bread. It is a crafters dream so easy to apply and saves so much time when tacking your ribbon or item down first before you sew. It stays in place no more crooked crafting.,5
B001687ZDA,"Perfect product for applique, love this and will definitely be buying more in the future",5
B001687ZDA,This is an old stand by for sewists doing applique. It works very well and is priced reasonably.,5
B001687ZDA,"I made a mermaid quilt for my 4-year-old granddaughter's birthday present.  I bought some other heat bond for the applique, and it was awful!  This brand is best by far.  The value (compared to what I found in the store) is excellent.",5
B001687ZDA,I like how this works on fabric but it does not adhere as well for wool.,4
B001687ZDA,I bought this for doing appliques....it came highly recommended.  Glad I could find it on Amazon,5
B001687ZDA,I use this fusible a lot & this product is great.,5
B001687ZDA,"Heat and Bond Lite is always my choice for applique for my quilts.  It is light weight enough to not substantially change the hand of the fabric, and holds well.  I use it for raw edge applique for wall hangings and other quilted items that don't require a lot of washing - usually sewn on with a buttonhole or satin stitch - some fraying will occur with washing, in which case I'll use a small amount of heat and bond in the center of the applique to hold it in place and use needle turn applique around the edges.",5
B001687ZDA,I have used this fusible for many years.  There is no better review than that,5
B001687ZDA,Bought this product to make some iron on quilt labels.  Making the labels went great.  HOWEVER when I attempted to iron the label on the quilt there was NO stick at all.,4
B001687ZDA,Received very quickly needed for a project,5
B001687ZDA,"I adhere birth day newspaper articles for a keepsake scrapbook for each new grandchild so they can read what happened on the day of their birth.  Maybe there's a better product of adhesive but it beats glue, tape or paste.  Each article is nicely bonded to the page, no wrinkles or discolorations and permanent...good for viewing in the distant future.  I use the lite, but haven't tried the extra lite.",5
B001687ZDA,Easy to use and works.,5
B001687ZDA,"Used this to adhere a patch of fabric to the skirt of a toddler dress so that I could embroider it. This was very easy to use, adhered perfectly, I was able to sew through it without issue. Offered the perfect amount of stability. It's going to last me a very long time, but I would definitely purchase this again!",5
B001687ZDA,"I'm making an over-sized queen quilt with ""applique"". Thought this would be the answer. Was impressed with it at first, BUT then my appliques started popping OFF & up.  Later learned I should have used another product.  Now I'll just incorporate my quilting into tacking the appliques down.",5
B001687ZDA,This product is so easy to use and great. I definitely recommend this product. It adheres pretty quickly and stays on for a good amount of time. I've tried many brands of backing and this is definitely one of the best. This is also a good sized roll for a really good price. It's hard to find never mind at this price.,5
B001687ZDA,Very easy to use with great sticking power easily peels,5
B001687ZDA,It irons/fuses nicely. I have not washed my applique yet to see how that works but it is very easy to use.,5
B001687ZDA,"Works well for quilting applique, especially small pieces",5
B001687ZDA,"I get this at a better price on Amazon then I can find anywhere else, especially since I have a Prime membership and don't have to pay for shipping.  I live in a very rural area so I can't just ""pop"" into Joann Fabrics and pick up a roll",5
B001687ZDA,Good directions. Easy to use. Did not give the quilt any stiffness either. I sewed the edges after bonding because the quilt will be used by my grandson for many years. I hope he will pass it on to his own child too.,5
B001687ZDA,"Luckily I had planned on sewing the applique that I made on.  Although it did stick for the most part, it definitely needs to be reinforced.",4
B001687ZDA,I used this to fuse two pieces of fabric together while making a playhouse for my grandson. The directions were easy to follow and the results were fantastic! It was just what I needed.,5
B001687ZDA,"Exactly what, when and how I ordered",5
B001687ZDA,I use this to back fabric for book covers. Creates a great barrier to stop glue from seeping through.,5
B001687ZDA,Use with Accent Cardstock for Foiling in Papercraft and card making. Works well with the Minc and every foil I've tried sticks to it with excellent results.Regular Heat N Bond is too sticky for that use.,5
B001687ZDA,"We bought this for a birthday party activity of making book marks with various fabrics.  I prepared by making two sided sheets of fabric with the Thermoweb. It adhered easily with ironing as described in the instructions. I also backed various printed fabric with the webbing.  Then the kids cut out the shapes they wanted, placed them where they wanted on the bookmark and I ironed for them.  Added yarn tassels and they were all set.  The glue has not come apart with time, but I did not test anything in the washer or dryer.",5
B001687ZDA,This is my first time using this type of product. I am working on an appliqued wall art piece.  This material is just what I thought a medium weight would be.  It could have offered a bit more in the way of instructions. I made a mess of my ironing board before I decided to google and find out what I did wrong.  I would suggest that new users do the same.,4
B001687ZDA,I had always purchased a different product at Joann's but the store I frequent was out of that product for months and even when I asked they seemed indifferent about correcting the situation.  They did not carry this product but I remembered that I had used it several years ago so I looked it up on Amazon.  I found exactly what I wanted at a great price and it works much better than the product I had been using so I will definitely stay with this.  It arrived in 2 days and I am more than happy with both the packaging and the product.,5
B001687ZDA,This iron-on adhesive works great for my raw edge applique projects.  It's a lighter weight that holds well.  I like it better than Steam a Seam.  There's a heavy duty one too but I don't like that one.  It's too heavy on a finished project and I don't think you can easily sew through it.,5
B001687ZDA,Thank you for the prompt shipping. Price is very good as well. Thank you very much,5
B001687ZDA,"Item arrived on time and was as described. This product worked great , it was easy to fuse to the fabric and made it easier to cut out the chess pieces for my project with no problems.",5
B001687ZDA,"This is one of my favorite tools for doing applique. Iron on fabric before stitching down the applique. Once you've done the tack down stitch, iron. I bought a small travel iron to use just for this as the big iron doesn't fit in the hoop as well. The Heat N Bond makes the applique adhere to the shirt, and makes the appliques look so much cleaner. I have much better success after I started using this product. You don't need a lot if you use it for appliques and this roll lasts a long time.",5
B001687ZDA,"I make a lot of quilts and use HeatnBond light for applique.  It's easy to use, soft and doesn't crease like the heavier product of this brand.",5
B001687ZDA,"I've used this product in the past, and ordered more when I ran out of my old supply, which was about two years old.  It was the same, as indicated on the old and the new packaging, Thermoweb Heat'n Bond Lite, so I'm sure it was supposed to be the same.  The new package required higher heat and a longer ironing time to work, and even after that, the layers, two single layers of thin cotton, didn't bond as well.  I did side-by-side tests with the old and the new, and it's definitely changed for the worse.  I'll still buy it unless I find a better alternative, but the new batch is definitely different and not in a good way.",3
B001687ZDA,Used this for making zippered pouches. Gave them good structure while being easy to sew thru.,5
B001687ZDA,"I really like this.  I usually use the other brand, but I think I like this one better.",5
B001687ZDA,Heatnbond Lite is very easy to use and a fusible I prefer when quilting and doing collages because it doesn't add extra bulk to my quilts and wall hangings. Instructions are included and are easy to follow. This product is so easy to use and adheres well.,5
B001687ZDA,I just completed a project which required thee use of a fairly large amount of fusible webbing.  I used this product almost exclusively as it did an excellent job as long as I followed the instructions.  The fabric stayed fused and produced a remarkable product.  There were no shards of fusing left on the edges to detract from what was being fused.  I will use this product again; it was so easy and pleasant to work with.,5
B001687ZDA,"I used this Thermoweb to bond cloth to a cardstock to make a mobile.  It did an amazing job and the mobile looks professional.  The cloth is not fraying at all, something I was worried about since the edges of the fabric are unfinished.  It was easy to cut through the cloth & cardstock to cut out the animals and I even sewed through both with no problems with the needle getting sticky.  A great product that I am glad that I have lots left for more projects.",5
B001687ZDA,It is a good quality product.  It was just a bit awkwad to unroll and straighten out long enough to cut sections.  Flat sheets would be easier to cut but maybe less economical.,5
B001687ZDA,"This is my favorite fusible stabilizer! It is light, easy to sew through, and it adheres very well. Just be sure your iron is hot enough otherwise it will be sticky for your needle to go through it.",5
B001687ZDA,Works well for simple projects where you need to stick two fabrics together. I used it to make a double sided cape that needed to have natural frayed edges with no stitching. Turned out great! Keep in mind it is the Lite version so the tack is not as strong as it could be with the normal one.,5
B001687ZDA,"Very useful, using them on many projects",5
B001687ZDA,N/A,5
B001687ZDA,I use a lot of heat and bond for applique. This is by far the best deal I've come across.,5
B07NT9LD38,Good product and price,5
B07NT9LD38,Good value. I would buy them again.,5
B07NT9LD38,"I've been using the Optiazure Thermal Laminating Pouches (9""x11"") for various projects, and they are exceptional in quality. Each pouch provides a crystal-clear finish that enhances the appearance of the documents or photos being laminated. The thickness of the pouches is just right, offering a sturdy feel without being too bulky.The 9""x11"" size is versatile, fitting standard letter-sized documents perfectly, and the slight extra margin makes the insertion of papers easy and forgiving. The laminated results are consistently smooth, with no air bubbles or wrinkles.One of the most impressive aspects is the durability these pouches offer. Documents laminated with these pouches are well-protected against spills, tears, and general wear and tear, ensuring longevity.These pouches work seamlessly with my laminator, and I've had no issues with jamming or uneven heating. The Optiazure Thermal Laminating Pouches are ideal for anyone needing reliable, high-quality lamination for professional or personal use. Highly recommended for their superb clarity and durability.",5
B07NT9LD38,These pouches are easy to use and are compatible with a variety of laminators.They work well and get the job done.,4
B07NT9LD38,Good quality and strength. Also a great price!,5
B07NT9LD38,I do a lot of laminating and these are quality 5mil sheets. I would buy these again.,5
B07NT9LD38,Nice,5
B07NT9LD38,Size and material is great,5
B07NT9LD38,"Overall, this works; BUT as a small business, I need consistent quality and these leave quite a bit to be desired. I feel like every so often I will pull one out of the box and it feels thinner than the rest. Also I have noticed that when laminating, it takes 3-4 runs for it to lose some of the cloudiness like the adhesive in the laminating pouch isn't working properly. I feel like for 5mil they are not 5mil as my Llama brand comes out much thicker. I am liking my Amazon Basics brand 3mil Glossy and Llama 5mil much better than this junk. Sadly I still have about 3/4 of the box to get through now that I have used about 25 sheets testing them out.",2
B07NT9LD38,"I am tarot reader so I like this kind of paper to make my own tarot cards, you can also use it for any kind of projects, pictures, etc.I recommend it guys!",5
B07NT9LD38,"Like the thickness if have to bend  perfect fit, ver bendable great item, thank you!",5
B07NT9LD38,Full size lamination sheets. Worked great on my home laminator.,5
B07NT9LD38,Very clear and firm 5mil quality laminate pouches.,5
B07NT9LD38,"Different brand than I was used to, but worked fine.",5
B07NT9LD38,Price and quality,5
B07NT9LD38,These work great.  I cannot tell any difference between these and the name brand ones I bought.,5
B07NT9LD38,"Exactly what I expected, could not be happier",5
B07NT9LD38,Works as well as other brands,5
B07NT9LD38,Laminate is quality equal to more expensive laminate.,5
B07NT9LD38,Was exactly what we needed!,5
B07NT9LD38,"It is thick and heavy duty, but keep in mind that if you laminate something thick, the seal will have large edges.  I tried laminating a thick photo with a single sheet of paper to make a matching game and I had very wide edges before it would seal.  It might be the laminating machine I was using, but something to keep in mind.",5
B07NT9LD38,Seals wonderfully.,5
B07NT9LD38,"We have purchased this item many times for our laminating needs.  Great price, fast shipping and great quality.  Super easy to use and have never had any issues.  We will continue to buy.",5
B07NT9LD38,THANKS,5
B07NT9LD38,These are 3 mil Laminating sheets.They work very well.I'll probably order some 10 mil sheets.,5
B07NT9LD38,"I use these for making my own board game cards and mats for PDF downloaded games. Once I laminate a sheet of cards, I cut them with a precision cutter. Other brands of laminate sheets I have used sometimes do not ""stick"" to the paper after the heat laminating process, but these hold well. They even hold the document in place well before I place it in the lamination machine. Highly Recommended!",5
B07NT9LD38,Very easy to use and durable.  Use the to laminate my granddaughters learning games.,5
B07NT9LD38,"The laminating sheets do their job. They are amazing, I love.them and recommend them.",5
B07NT9LD38,Perfect for my laminating project.. better price than Staples..durable.  will last a very long time..nice and thick as well,5
B07NT9LD38,Purchased the laminator and these for added projects. School time and photographs have never looked better!,5
B07NT9LD38,"I'm giving it 4.5 stars, I'll tell you why. First off, I was done with my 1st grader losing number charts and sight word sheets or getting them wet or whatever. Since we're learning from home now I thought screw it - were getting a laminator. I have reading games and cards and needed to laminate them too if they were going to survive into next month. The vast majority of my sheets went through without bending/crinkling. For those that didn't turn out fine I noticed a pattern - they were the smaller, pre-cut cards placed more towards the center of the laminating sheet. Two top corners would bend inward slightly. It was when I placed them towards the top edge (the end where you insert it into the machine) that the issues would stop. I did 23 sheets total, 3 had the crinkles before I got the hang of things.  After that it was smooth sailing. Hope this helps.",4
B07NT9LD38,Item is just like described and works.,5
B07NT9LD38,Compare this brand's price to Office Depot or Maxs' and you'll see what I mean.,5
B07NT9LD38,"I found these pouches to be of a very good quality, they are clear, thick and seal shut very well with my Amazon laminator.  They provide a decent margin around the edge of Letter paper to good bonding at the edge of the pouch and  there is no cloudiness in the plastic once they are heat sealed.",5
B07NT9LD38,"This lamination does not lay flat when it is finisihed laminating. It comes out of the machine with corners slightly curled, or a roll in the middles. It is not my laminating machine because slightly more expensive brands do just fine. If you are needing quaility lamination, pay the extra. However, if you are okay with a slightly warped product everytime, then this laminating material will do.",1
B07NT9LD38,Price was very good.  Sleeves worked perfectly in my laminator,5
B07NT9LD38,If you are laminating items that will have a border around the item then these pouches will work fine.  The 2 sides of the pouch seals with itself fine and stays put.If you are laminating items that will be cut with out a border than choose Scotch.  Some parts of the pouch will stay bonded to paper just fine but others will not and they will pull apart.  All my Scotch pouches stayed bonded no matter how they were cut.,4
B07NT9LD38,Good,5
B07NT9LD38,I love this item looks so professional .,5
B07NT9LD38,I have paid more for alot lower quality!Work great would strongly recommend this product!!,5
B07NT9LD38,"They shipped the pouches in a butcher paper sleeve which allowed the product box inside to tear and become dented. The sleeves took weeks to get here and arrived dented, rendering them unusable for laminating due to the creases. They are good thick pouches, but I am only able to use less than a quarter of them due to the dents from shipping. After waiting so long to get them, this was ultimately a disappointment.",2
B07NT9LD38,These are great for laminating home printed photos.  Makes the photos last longer.,5
B07NT9LD38,"Easy to use,  great results!",5
B07NT9LD38,Laminating sheets worked as expected.,5
B07NT9LD38,Better than what expected.,5
B07NT9LD38,Works as advertised.,5
B07NT9LD38,"The hot laminating pouches were as expected, arrived quickly and the price was reasonable.  Good Value and I would buy again.",5
B07NT9LD38,"Love these laminating sheets!  Projects come out very clear & is not a flimsy sheet.  My son asked me to make a cookbook of family favorites.  I was going to just do up a few recipes but when I saw how cool the pages turned out after laminating them, I ended up doing 150 recipes with index & header pages.  I just bought my 3rd pack of these sheets in anticipating another project.  Great quality & price.  And if you happen to mess up a sheet, like it comes out a little bent on an end or side, just run it through your laminator machine a 2nd time and it will clear up.",5
B07NT9LD38,Very easy to use. Sturdy.,5
B07NT9LD38,Does exactly as expected.,5
B07NT9LD38,These are great! Easy to use and nice and thick.,5
B07NT9LD38,Works great in my laminator and a third of the price of what they are asking at Staples.,5
B07NT9LD38,Second time I have bought these. I am a teacher and I depend on durability when laminating items for my classroom. This product performs well. They are just thick enough and they go through the laminator well.,5
B07NT9LD38,So laminating sheets are pretty much the same but I love them. Sometimes the sheets are difficult to use and have air pockets but this product has been easy to use and I have found absolutely no air pockets at all!,5
B07NT9LD38,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!! My first lamination sheets, which does not fail me when laminating. Super strong and seals super well!! I love it! Thanks!",5
B07NT9LD38,this product works just as well as the more expensive.  It is durable and produces good quality lamination.,5
B07NT9LD38,It's a crap shot on if it's going to seal as expected. No matter the brand or thickness I always run it through twice to always insure proper lamination. I have gotten proper with these 5mil sheets and I have also not just as much. I have only attempted 7 or 8 times but I have had to redo it 3 times now.,3
B07NT9LD38,Product is as described,5
B07NT9LD38,Works great,5
B07NT9LD38,"Seals great, clear and very good quality",5
B07NT9LD38,Excellent quality. The 300 pouches were packaged in units of 100 for easier storage.,5
B07NT9LD38,I was very happy to save some money with these. Laminating paper is getting more expensive at the store and I was happy to find this pack for the price,5
B07NT9LD38,I used these to laminate classroom posters. They are very sturdy and worked perfectly. Packaging was good.,5
B07NT9LD38,"Will buy again once I use all this up. Great value, no complaints at all.",5
B07NT9LD38,Good quality,5
B07NT9LD38,Me facilita el trabajo,5
B07NT9LD38,purchasing more,5
B07NT9LD38,I love it because is not hard to angular my paper easy to place it and ready to go,5
B07NT9LD38,Such a great price! I recommend  this,5
B07NT9LD38,I like the price for the product.,5
B07NT9LD38,"Edit: I'm moving up to 3 stars because they refunded me my money. Everything I said about the bags still stands though.These sheets were awful. I think out of the 200, only like 60 or so were fine. Some wouldn't even go in the laminator correctly, and others would so I know it was a problem with the sheets. Some would wrinkled badly and others would hang loosely, not adhering to the paper. I can't say if I got a defective batch, since CS was no help. They refused to do anything, except after much back and forth, they offer me a pitiable discount. No way, was I going to risk paying almost 20 a second time for awful sheets.",3
B07NT9LD38,"After checking several companies. the price for 300 laminating sheets proved to be the most economical.  I only use my laminator for home projects, so I am not expecting professional end products.  I don't know how much difference there is between these sheets and those used by professionals, but I would imagine they are pretty much up to par.",5
B07NT9LD38,Laminate ready,5
B07NT9LD38,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Great quality thermal sheets.,5
B07NT9LD38,These work perfectly in my amazon brand laminator. Just came back to order another package.,5
B07NT9LD38,Bought these to use for Christmas ornaments that were acrilic it worked out exactly as I planned great product great value,4
B07NT9LD38,I am a special education teacher and therefore visuals are a very important component to my teaching. Lamination helps to preserve these visuals and I tend to go through a lot of lamination pouches each year. Optiazure pouches are high quality and a great value for your money. They arrived within a reasonable time and I would definitely buy them again.,5
B07NT9LD38,"Well I've used about 15 of them and 3 of them did not adhere properly when they came out of the lamination machine.  Not a good start to the pack.  I purchased these to save some money over the ""name brand"" alternatives (which I didn't even have 1 that failed to stick correctly).  Not sure this was the right move.  I tried them after all the good reviews, but so far, it's not been perfect.  We'll see how the rest of the pack goes.",3
B07NT9LD38,"I purchased these laminating sheets as I had an issue with a brand I had previously purchased. For the price, these are an excellent value. The sheets were not too flimsy, came out of the package easily and without excessive static buildup, opened easily to insert pages and fed well into my laminator without unnecessary jams, etc. Will purchase these again when needed.",5
B07NT9LD38,"As a teacher for MANY years, I have used several different brands of laminating sheets without major issues. I purchased this brand thinking laminating sheets were probably mostly all the same since I had never really had an issue. I'm sorry to say that this brand was definitely a waste of money. I don't usually write many reviews, but wanted to add my two cents on this one. This is one product you should probably reread the negative reviews carefully. Most of the issues mentioned in them are true, especially when laminating items smaller than your typical 8 x 10 pages. I did not have a problem with mine coming apart, but did have a lot of trouble with the sheets curling up during the laminating process and jamming in my machine. I tested two other brands to rule out machine issues. They worked just fine. Very flimsy sheets. :-(",2
B07NT9LD38,"These make very nice laminations.  If you have a large area with nothing between the layers, you will get some bubbles, but that is true with most brands.  Would definately buy again!",5
B07NT9LD38,"Love these sheets. You can cut small pieces. Made a bingo game, flashcards, worksheets, puzzle, matching game etc. I love that you can print a whole page then cut it into sections and the pieces remain laminated. The pages flip portion sticks just the right amount to adjust and keep still when sliding into the laminator. Love them! Good price deal too.",5
B07NT9LD38,Nice product,5
B07NT9LD38,"This product is excellent and is perfect for laminating.  Nice fine finish and durable, great price.",5
B07NT9LD38,Works just fine,5
B07NT9LD38,This is just what I needed. I needed some more sheets for my laminator and these work great.,5
B07NT9LD38,"I'm not sure if the Laminating Pouches suck, or if the laminating machine sucks. One of them isn't so great, though. Maybe they're both just mediocre? Maybe it's me? It's gotta be the machine, right? Some of the pages come out with bubbles, and some come out wavy. The pages that come out decent are nice, though. The Pouches are easy to use, and not as staticky as some other pouches that I've used. I also think I'd like a sturdier page, so I'll probably get 5mil next time.",3
B002TOL41Y,I like the bright colors. It feels just like the best duct tape I ever had.,5
B002TOL41Y,"this is good sticky Duck Tape and a good blaze orange, not a Neon color.  It was the best price at the time plus we got the Amazon credit card points too.  would buy again.",4
B002TOL41Y,Perfect color. Shows up great. Seals wonderfully. Perfectly durable as all duct tape is. Gas great hold. Sticks great. Reflects great.,5
B002TOL41Y,"No complaints. It works well, as expected. I guess I mostly use it artistically like as decorative tape since it has been issued in such fun colors. I have a container of QTips I just covered in this tape for fun since my apartment is red, orange and yellow. You might enjoy it yourself!",5
B002TOL41Y,"This duct tape is useful for all sorts of household and outdoor uses! The adhesive sticks well, the tape tears easily and cleanly, and this particular brand offers several different color options instead of the regular grey. The high visibility colors are great for marking things! It's great as regular duct tape too for taping things together.Always handy to have some duct tape around!",5
B002TOL41Y,Great,5
B002TOL41Y,Great value for your money.  Lots of different uses.  Easy to use and easy to tear.,5
B002TOL41Y,"It's bright and it's sticky. Little on the thin and flimsy side, but it worked well for marking my bear canister so I can easily see it in the woods!",4
B002TOL41Y,Easy to cut and use.,5
B002TOL41Y,"Great price, just as described",5
B002TOL41Y,"I bought six (6) of these from Amazon and four (4) more from Ace Hardware to have enough colors to code a color for each room during a move. I took my 6 into Ace to get colors that I didn't already have from Amazon. A check-out woman what I was doing with all this tape; and when I told her, she said she was planning to move and was going to do what I'm doing..I did this for my last move.. Stuck a color tape on the right boxes and gave the master sheet (see photo) to the movers. It makes a move SO much easier and more organized for the movers; in fact, the head mover took a photo and adapted it for himself to pass on to future clients! And much easier unpacking stuff for myself.With all that positivity, I must tell you that this not only very strong tape, it is also very sticky. It takes a bit of ""muscle"" to the roll started and usually use a scissors to cut. But it works great!! Love it.",4
B002TOL41Y,"The ""Electric Blue"" color really stands out when used on the white shipping packages I use for sending out records. Not only that, it is obviously sturdy enough for this particular purpose.Also, this particular colour comes  20yd, while other options here are only 10yd or 15yd.",5
B002TOL41Y,I used this in part of my d.i.y costume this was great!!! It did the job!#ducttape #ducktape #orange,4
B002TOL41Y,works great,5
B002TOL41Y,It really helped when traveling or going on teams training events to identify baggage from afar.,5
B002TOL41Y,IF YOU WANT A REALLY BRIGHT GREEN THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO BEST.  THE OTHER IS MORE LIKE DUCT TAPE THIS IS A BIT IGHTER BUT STURDY,5
B002TOL41Y,This is made with quality ducks,5
B002TOL41Y,Great tape for marking just about anything. Dang good overall tape.,5
B002TOL41Y,"My co-workers finally stopped talking and because of the bright color, i could see them coming from a long ways away!",5
B002TOL41Y,"I've never had tape be this strong and sticky.  The photos are my 2hp pool pump basket.  It split open and while waiting for a new one, I used the orange duck tape to hold it together.  These photos are after a week.  I mean, this is under water in a pump housing pulling large volumes of water through it.  The tape never moved.I've used this tape in several other uses.  It's just the best.",5
B002TOL41Y,I DO A LOT OF LAST-MINUTE MENDING WORK  AND THIS IS VERY HANDY,5
B002TOL41Y,Sticky!,5
B002TOL41Y,"I love this color, but I find that it does not stay down as well as other duct tapes do.",4
B002TOL41Y,"From the pix, I thought this would be more of a lime green color, which I needed to mend a suitcase that was damaged on a recent flight. But the color is definitely neon green and not lime. The picture looks lime green but it is greenier than the photo shows. So I had to return it. I subtracted one star for the inaccurate online color view. But I like the brand and will continue to look for a limey color again.",4
B002TOL41Y,I bought those because I have a window air and I didn't want anybody to smack their little head on it so I put the tape on. It works perfect.,5
B002TOL41Y,i like duck brand  its good and reliable and easy to find a good price on amazon..the colors are so helpful for projects and safety use..im happy i could find this  neon green! all the neon colors re awesome and fun!!,5
B002TOL41Y,It's duct tape. I'm not sure what to say. We purchased this to mark totes that have Halloween items in them. It works great for us. We live in a very humid climate and the adhesive holds up well. The totes are stored in our garage,4
B002TOL41Y,good quality,5
B002TOL41Y,"Neon orange duct tape is what I wanted, and this is as close to that color as I have been able to get in duct tape of just about any brand. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I expect duct tape to stick well to other ""stuff"" but release easily from itself when you pull a piece from the roll. Maybe the tape has gotten thinner over the years, but I find that this tape ""stretches"" and sticks to the tape under it on the roll instead of giving a crisp release.  This isn't easy to explain in writing, but when you pull up on the tape to rip a piece off the roll you end up battling with the piece that you are trying to pull off because its glue sticks too well to the tape underneath it on the roll. You end up with a stretched piece of duct tape in which you can see the ""webbing"" to which the tape facing and the glue are bonded. This wouldn't be anything more than a slight irritation if it weren't for the fact that the ripped-off piece of tape seems to be a little less ""stickier"" after the battle to get it to leave the rest of the roll. If the neon orange color hadn't been very close to what I wanted, I might have given only 3 stars. But it does stick better than some other brands I've purchased, so 4 stars it is.",4
B002TOL41Y,"We have a shade umbrella that has some tears in the cloth. We found the blue colored Duck Tape matched pretty good, so we salvaged the umbrella. I have rolls of regular Duck tape all over my house and in my cars. Good stuff.",5
B002TOL41Y,No more flying table cloths flying away because of the wind,5
B002TOL41Y,"Cute color, it's tape and it does its job.",5
B002TOL41Y,It works good for what I get it.,5
B002TOL41Y,"I used an ""off-brand"" of silver tape to connect the duct work running from from my new electric dryer in the basement, extending from the floor, up along the concrete wall, and through a widow vent.  It did not stay together very long.  I think the heat caused the adhesive on the tape to melt, so even though they were properly positioned male:fmale ends, most of the pieces started to come apart .  So I decided to spend the money for real Duck Tape.  Wow - I had forgotten how very sticky that brand of tape really is !!  The Duck Tape was a bit more difficult to handle than the cheaper and less sticky tape, and more expensive, but I am pretty sure it will last a longer.",5
B002TOL41Y,This matched my favorite orange suitcase handle that was coming apart!  Problem solved with this tape!,5
B002TOL41Y,Works well for crafting,5
B002TOL41Y,Seems a little thin for duct tape but got it for the color to mark tools. Works okay for that,4
B002TOL41Y,"Durability, quality and price! In the best color to boot! Mahalo/Thank you!",5
B002TOL41Y,"Good duct tape, and the color I wanted",5
B002TOL41Y,i use for color coding projects. excellent,5
B002TOL41Y,would recommend,5
B002TOL41Y,It was fine.,5
B002TOL41Y,I bought this for my daughter to use for a school project. The gold color was perfect for what we needed. Fast delivery.,5
B002TOL41Y,I like the product and the color.,5
B002TOL41Y,Tape color was accurate. But the product seemed old.,3
B002TOL41Y,"This tape is fantastic. Good value. Good adhesion. Made in the USA. But...It can be difficult to see the true color of a product from an online image. And unfortunately, I could not get the color match I was looking for. I will keep it...for use as regular tape. I like to use a specific color to mark my tools with, and I was looking for a slightly different shade of green.From now on I will stick to buying things, where the specific color is very important, in the stores. Unless I know the exact name of the color and know 100% that it will be a match. I recommend the same to others.",4
B002TOL41Y,"I've tried the rest, the less, in an attempt to cost cut however  the inferiority  of most of those I tried cost more after aleuther being stuck together ripping insureds as you attempt to unwind it or not have any durable sticking power- cheap or to little adhesive. Consequentl I've  decided to stick with the DUCK ,we go all the way back to the day and it keeps right on Adhering yo whatever you afix it.",5
B002TOL41Y,Great for repairing anything that needs a metallic-look finish!,5
B002TOL41Y,The quality was fine the color was fine but I felt like I hardly got enough duct tape for my project.,3
B002TOL41Y,"I am very happy with this purchase. Fast delivery, undamaged, perfect for my truck. A1 seller.",5
B002TOL41Y,"I bought this tape in flourescent green to mark the edge of the step-down on our deck for my mom who lives with us.  She has macular degeneration in 1 eye and has trouble seeing where the step-down is outside her door. This bright tape is easy for her to see, and holds up well to the weather as well.",5
B002TOL41Y,Easy to spot,5
B002TOL41Y,"Highly recommended. Use every tape known toman- normal duct tape, painters, electrical, packing, etc,. This duct tape is wicked strong, non damaging, and holds grip for extensive periods.",5
B002TOL41Y,This duct tape may be a pretty color but as far as durability and sticky-ness and I give it a 2/5 stars. Definitely not going to hold anything together for long. Gorilla tape is where it's at these days! Sorry duct tape! lol,2
B002TOL41Y,Love the color and the tape is very strong,5
B002TOL41Y,We continue to buy this tape because it works well. Reliable and the bright color is great for what we need.,5
B002TOL41Y,Does not stick,3
B002TOL41Y,Just what I was looking for and the right color as well,5
B002TOL41Y,What do you expect? Even the astronauts used this stuff in space.,5
B002TOL41Y,I used the bright green tape to put on my luggage.  I was able to see my bags from a mile away at the airport.,5
B002TOL41Y,"I enjoy making greeting cards, and I'm always looking for new things to use in my crafting. Saw this and knew immediately what I wanted to do with it.Metallic card stock can be VERY pricey, and I don't use a whole lot of it, which makes purchasing a 25- or 50-sheet package I bit uneconomical.Enter this metallic duct tape.I put a piece of the tape on a piece of (much cheaper) plain cardstock, and run it through my die cutter to create a trim, border, flourish, frame, letter/number, whatever. It cuts just fine, and it looks great! It's slightly textured from the woven fiber base, but that just adds to the appeal for me.The tape has a tendency to stretch a bit as I'm unrolling it from the roll, but I found that if I just take my time and use even pressure, it comes cleanly off the roll.Very happy with this! I also purchased the silver/chrome version as well. Wish they made it in copper!",5
B002TOL41Y,"Duck Tape, in my opinion, is the best quality duct tape brand on the market in terms of durability and adhesion.  However, when buying this roll it's important to keep in mind that the tape itself is not very shiny or vibrant.  If you're prioritizing the appearance of the tape over the quality, I'd say opt for a different brand that has a better color.  This cold is most certainly dull, but was perfect for my purposes!",4
B002TOL41Y,Appears to be a good product and it should work well for what I needed.,5
B002TOL41Y,"Full disclosure: I have arthritis, so maybe my experience is impacted but sweet Sally, this stuff does NOT come off the role easily. It sticks very well once applied to where it's going, so that's great, but getting it there is tough.My LO specifically requested this, so I'm keeping it and going to power through using it, but once it's gone, I will not be repeating the purchase.",3
B002TOL41Y,Doesn't stick much like the store brand... not sure if it's the real thing or imitation duck tape,3
B002TOL41Y,"I couldn't bring myself to buy a store-made costume for our 6-year old, so it was duck tape to the rescue! Thankfully I found shades of orange and blue he agreed were close enough to work for his pokemon of choice. They ended up working great and his costume was a hit. My only gripe was that the rolls were small enough I had to make a second order to get enough coverage for what we had in mind. No big deal, we got it done in time. I love the rainbow of colors these tapes come in now.",4
B002TOL41Y,As advertised,5
B002TOL41Y,I used it to reinforce the seams on my bedside bag and it works perfect. I love that I was able to find the same green as the bag.,5
B002TOL41Y,"A little pricey when compared to normal duct tape but I guess that has to do with the fact that it is colored... Im so used to using gorilla tape now at this point and only bought duct tape because of the color. The adhesion is not bad just like your regular duct tape. However I would only recommend this for crafts and such that require this color. Otherwise if you're looking for the ultimate adhesion and quality wise, I would give gorilla tape a try. Otherwise this does great for my needs :)",5
B002TOL41Y,"It's a small inconvience but will still have a major impact on the final product. I've order several rolls for Duck brand Metallic gold duct tape and receive 3 different colors. Seperate orders only a few days apart ordering 1, 2, 4, 1, etc. 2 colors are still very much yellow, one brighter than the other, one is more brown or bronze and less metallic (2 rolls). See photos. The color differences stand out a lot more in person. The bronze rolls don't have the same adhensive either. They're smoother and don't stick as well to the cardboard.",4
B002TOL41Y,Not much on roll but cheaper,3
B002TOL41Y,Easy to use and has the proper stick and hold features.,5
B002TOL41Y,Put a few strips on my rear SUV antenna to make it easier to spot in a busy parking lot,5
B002TOL41Y,"Product tape is super vibrant and adheres to just about anything you have. However, unlike common duct tape which is woven and can be torn without a great deal of effort, this version doesn't even cut uniformly with scissors without a fight.",4
B002TOL41Y,Used this around my window AC units to make them look nicer and give them more insulation.,5
B002TOL41Y,Not shiny though,4
B002TOL41Y,Terrible product. Barely sticky. I need to buy better so I'm out a few bucks I can't afford to lose. Not happy.,1
B002TOL41Y,"I liked the color of this tape. I needed a ""blaze orange"" to make a ribbon/bow and this was just right. The adhesion was pretty good as it took lots and lots of corn starch to make it not sticky anymore. It is not as sticky as the silver duct tape we usually buy so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",4
B002TOL41Y,It is invisible if you use it for green screen editing /  video.  great to have this particular color if you are doing green screen projects.  the tape is consistent with regular duct tape.  They don't sell this particular color in any of the hardware stores in my neck of the woods.,5
B002TOL41Y,This is the best green duc(k)t tape I've ever purchased.,4
B002TOL41Y,"Beautiful! I bought one of those big portable plastic art supply organizers a while back for a deep discount because it had a 1"" x 5"" opening along the top of the side wall from some impact or drop it incurred.I figured I would 'wall' it back up with a couple layers of strong, trusty duct tape which I knew nowadays came in an assortment of styles ~ I was sure they must have gold duct tape available somewhere, and here it was!It's a tasteful shade of gold with just enough metallic to make it look nice, not garish.It has the strength and durability that you expect of duct tape.",5
B07DP25SRG,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Excellent for Using them as knife guides when cutting straight edges on paper or cardboard.  They Excell because of their thickness, easy readability, AND their ability to hold onto the paper or cardboard WITHOUT SLIPPING! Once you put them down, they stay put.  They have a Very slight but effective edge on the bottom that grips without making any impression or marks on the paper.  The set is magical and is now my favorite.  A wonderful variety of sizes, each as perfect as the other, and sturdy to last without bending.  Excellent quality.I have many rulers each with problems.  This SET is perfect - both readable in inch & metric - no upside down reading and deeply incised so no wearing off.  Being Non-Slip is so helpful - your careful placement doesn't slide!! So many great sizes gave me luxery of the right size for different crafts.  They greatly improved my bookbinding cuts and sewing markings.  Such a great deal for Perfect Rullers.  THANKS",5
B07DP25SRG,Love these. Love that they come in so many sizes. Love the strength and that I can use them for many different projects. I carry the small one in my tiny notebook and use the various sizes for my various needs at different locations I have to be at. Love them very much. 100% would buy again.,5
B07DP25SRG,Nice but not starting at the edges. Works great,4
B07DP25SRG,exactly what I was looking for. The quality is excellent for some mechanical measurements,5
B07DP25SRG,Very nice.,5
B07DP25SRG,Love these! Numbers and marks don't rub off or even scratch off. Thick and ridgid. Good buy!,5
B07DP25SRG,"For the price, this is a great set of rulers.  Four different sizes, each with a plastic slip case.  Rulings are easy to read.  They should last for years.  Have helpful mm to in and fraction to decimal conversion tables embossed on the back side.  These are stainless, but of the type that will stick to magnets which is convenient for storage.  The only drawback that I encountered is that the edges are slightly rough to the touch (probably from stamping the markings into the steel).  A light dressing with fine sandpaper fixed this easily.  I would recommend these.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I got for my cousin he makes American Indian jewelry & does leather work , he is American Indian & was taught buy his great grandfather when he was a boy &  he does pow wows a couple times a year so he makes a lot of crafts . He had some metal rulers for years but they do in fact wear out over time so I got him this set & he loves it ,he said he has all the size of ruler's he needs now he is so happy .",5
B07DP25SRG,Purchased these for use with Cricut vinyl. Love the different sizes for different applications. Markings are easy to read.,5
B07DP25SRG,"I really like these rulers, especially since them come in black. My only issue is with the orientation of the inches vs centimeters. I mostly use these for drawing precision lines, but it would be nice if the two sides were opposite (like most rulers are) so I can measure more easily with cm. It's kind of annoying that it's right side up so I have to use the bottom of the ruler instead of along the top for cm.",4
B07DP25SRG,These have been awesome! I use them all the time,5
B07DP25SRG,"They're precision rulers and I like the black / white contrast. THEY ARE NOT STEEL! ( that's why I only gave them 4 stars. ) I would have preferred if they were steel ( like they say they are ) to work with magnets but they are aluminum which is ok. The only thing I don't like is they have about 1/8"" of blank space at the end where the measuring scale begins. This would require constant deductions in the measuring process so I sanded the end of both rulers to very near the line then hand filed right up to the first white line of the measurement scale so it's a true reading. I verified the accuracy with a 10X magnifying lens. I'm right on the line. If it's off it is only by 1/64"" or less & I can work with that for most of what I'm measuring. The holes in the end are nice so I can hang them up & out of the way so they don't get banged up in a drawer or tool box. Oh yeah, they came with a sticker of a mustache. I guess that's the trick with Mr. Pen. I stuck it on the tail stock of my new lathe. LOL. Why not? I had bought some markers from Mr. Pen before and put the sticker on the tail stock of my old lathe. Now we all have mustaches... LMAO. get the rulers. They're a good product.",4
B07DP25SRG,Nice package; great rulers (accurate; nicely etched; as pictured); a mustache sticker as a gift!,5
B07DP25SRG,Good,5
B07DP25SRG,I got these to match my gold and acrylic office accessories. They are nice rulers with clear print and a nice gold color. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was that they were a little thinner and more flexible than expected.,4
B07DP25SRG,Good quality. Accurate. Durable.,5
B07DP25SRG,They get the job done and last forever.,4
B07DP25SRG,Great for following along lines when doing data entry.,5
B07DP25SRG,These are perfect for getting the perfect edge lined up and  pressed into my French seams when it's time to sew them at the inside of garment. I can keep the ruler in my seam to be and press right on it while it's inserted at the seam then pin and pull out. These don't have cork or silicone so they slide out beautifully.,5
B07DP25SRG,"Terrific assortment of well made, beautiful rulers, Thanks!",5
B07DP25SRG,Very strong & I love using the rulers.,5
B07DP25SRG,"Lightweight, thin.",3
B07DP25SRG,Very good customer service and fast delivery.Thank you!,5
B07DP25SRG,"Not sure what it is about metal rulers but I just love them.  The work great, easy to read and are durable.",5
B07DP25SRG,"As others have pointed out, the scale does not begin at the edge of the ruler. I probably should have noticed this in the pictures but it didn't occur to me that metal rulers would be fabricated this way. Also the 14-in ruler does not have a hole for hanging, so I'm using a magnet to hang. Not a huge deal but had I known I would have probably bought something else as I was looking for a little bit more of a precision set.",3
B07DP25SRG,"As a seamstress, who owns a shop with 3 other employees, we ALL love these!It's rare we all agree om a specific sewing notion brand / item. I normally have to purchase everyone their own preferences. I bought one pack for myself, and they kept stealing them! So I had to buy more.Worth every penny to not have to wander the shop in search of who stole mine anymore.",5
B07DP25SRG,"Nice assortment of rulers.  They are accurate, well made and can be hung on a wall for easy access.  The negative I have is that there is about a 1/8"" tail on one end and about a 3/4"" on the other, see photos.  I use the rulers for crafting and need very accurate measurements.  I have to account for this when doing interior measurements in recessed interior corners for an accurate measurement. I am used to using longer rulers, i.e. 24"" and 36"" that don't have ""tails"" on the ends but had a need for shorter rulers.",4
B07DP25SRG,"Exactly what I needed.  Like that they come in sleeves or can hang 3 of the 4, would have liked if all 4 were hangable.",5
B07DP25SRG,I'm a reseller and occasionally I need to show the buyer sizes of items. Perfect little rullers to measure and use when I take photos. Happy buyer here,5
B07DP25SRG,"These are essential for crafting of all types. When you put them down, they stay. They bend when needed, yet durable and sturdy.",5
B07DP25SRG,"These rulers are very solid, and not easily bendable without great effort. The numbers and lines are easy to read, and seem very accurate. The only downside is some sharp edges and burrs along the edge. I made a quick-soft brush along the edge with some 400 grit sandpaper, and it did the trick. (should really be done during manufacturing) The conversions on the back are a nice add, along with the handle storage sheaths. (moustache sticker was a nice touch)",4
B07DP25SRG,A+++++,5
B07DP25SRG,"I was looking for something to have at my desk to guide me across the page but to also have a way to do measurements. Having the metric also is great as so many items purchased have metric measurements listed in the description. it is so helpful to have the different lengths. Some days I am just looking at a small space and hate fumbling with long rulers that just get in my way. But other days, I am working with large ledger pages and need that long extension across the page. Having the 4 options is a big bonus. I also love that they are thin and easy to handle. Only one thing has hit me so far, why did all of them come with holes to easily hang except the 14""? Consistency would have been nice. I can hang them all, except one, on a magnetic hook on the side of my filing cabinet for easy reach. They come in a nice plastic sleeve that I was able to put a hole in to hang, but these will not likely last long and then I will have to find a different option for the 14"". Minor issue.",5
B07DP25SRG,The rules are very nice and the customer service is really good.,5
B07DP25SRG,They are steel rulers,5
B07DP25SRG,"I have all sorts of rulers, shapes and templates. A good ruler is hard to come by. Liked these so much I bought another set. Please take note, these are NOT end rulers. Markings do not go to any end of the rulers. For instance, you can't set height of a router or saw unless you take into account for the gap. All of them have a fraction to mm Conversion Table, to 5 decimal places.Each ruler has sections where the tic-marks are 1/16ts, 1/32ds, and 1/64ths. Depending on how accurate you want to be, you can use one ruler to measure, if that area is between tic-marks, stack another one on top of it with the 32 or 64 and you will be that much more accurate. That's the part of WHY I love this set.They're all identical, just different lengths. The widths are the same and easily stacked. So I always have access to a greater scale measurement.The opposite holds true as well. For instance, on the 12 inch ruler, 1-3 is in 32nds, 3-4 is in 64ths. If I want 16ths in any of that area. Stacked ruler with 16ths, line up the tic-marks and I get an accurate measurement.Haven't written about the metric side. I'm starting to use it for setting up the router height and width of the cut. SAE is the minority. We have a world of different products that we have access to. Many of them are metric in scale. On many occasions I've found that a metric setting on my woodworking equipment, can be more accurate.The metric side, 1-10cm looks really dense with the tic-marks. Goes down to a 10th of a mm. You can stack the rulers or just use the other end. I'll probably NEVER use that end. Need a magnifying glass. If I need to be that accurate, I'll just use my needle gauge or steel bar set.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I really like all the sizes included. The smallest sizes are perfect for keeping with my pens in a jar, and the longest works well for art projects where i need that type of length to cut against.I bought these because I got frustrated with plastic and wooden rulers to use a utility knife against to cut paper. They would slowly shave away with the sharpness of the knife. I didn't like the options I had at the craft stores, they only displayed the long 18-inch rulers. I prefer the 6-8 inch sizes. Very happy with these! :)",5
B07DP25SRG,I liked the variety of sizes and ease of reading.,5
B07DP25SRG,They work,5
B07DP25SRG,"I've only had the rulers a couple of weeks, and already the numbers are coming off, and it was difficult to read BEFORE that happened.  The notches on the ruler all look the same--it doesn't have enough differentiation in the lines to show 1/4, 1/2 and a full inch.  Everything looks like an eighth or a sixteenth.  I wish I hasn't bought them, and I bought 2 sets!UPDATE:  I also bought a different version of this product; the 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 inch set, and unlike the first ones, they didn't begin at zero when you sit the ruler down, for example, I'm a potter, so I like the version (even with the numbers coming off) to tell how high a pot I've thrown because I can set the ruler on the wheel head.  These are not THOSE Mr. Pen rulers.  They have a gap.  BOO Mr. Pen for not having the same ruler in different sets.I would return them but I could only return it to Kohls for free.  It would cost me almost the price of the rulers to take it to the convenient UPS store, and also convenient Staples wasn't an option.I would also like to note that Mr. Pen never reached out to me to replace the ones with the numbers rubbing off in the first 2 weeks.  I used to think I LIKED Mr. Pen Products, but I guess not.",3
B07DP25SRG,Metal rulers are easier to cut clay for projects,5
B07DP25SRG,"The product is flexibility, readability , quality , good material , straight and weight is good",5
B07DP25SRG,Great.,5
B07DP25SRG,"I like these.  I use the 6"" ruler for marking hems when sewing or adjusting a hem.  It works great.  I reordered these for a friend.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I purchased these metal rulers by recommendation from a friend. I haven't really used them, but I did inspect them and tested the flexibility. They are metal rulers so you should definitely refrain from hitting any living thing with then as that could cause harm. I was concerned that the edges would be too sharp, but luckily they aren't, cause I am rather accident prone and that would not be beneficial to me if they were. So don't worry, there are no sharp corners. I do really like the rounded edge of the 6"", 8"", and 12"" rulers. The 15"" ruler has flat edges, which is totally fine. They measurements are presented in both metric and imperial units, which is very helpful And the markings are etched in the metals so they won't rub off. They also all come in these orange protective sleeves, which I absolutely love - I have non natural lighting in my room so the sleeves look more coral colored and that goes with the color scheme of my craft area. So that is a win for me. The 6"", 8"", and 12"" all have holes at The rounded end so you could hang them (which I have elected to do). I like the product. I like how it was relatively inexpensive, is made of good quality metal, came in a variety measurement lengths for all sorts of projects, and came in protective sleeves. I do recommend this product and if they do make a metal yard/meter stick I will definitely purchase that as well.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I purchased these rulers. It's pretty bad. It's not steel, much less stainless steel, it's aluminum. The numbers and gradation are applied with paint.From the good: the size is correct.Disappointed. I don't recommend it.",2
B07DP25SRG,"As a Canadian in the US, the lack of metric is infuriating and inconvenient. These will save your life. They're very accurate, the printing scale is perfect, there's conversion rates on the back, it splits mms up into halves on portion, I wanna keep one of these in my pocket at all times here. Amazing quality, I'll probably be buying multiple more to just keep them around everywhere.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I wanted to upgrade my mixed 'set' of work rules, and this would do just what I needed. I zoomed in on the beginning of each picture to assure myself there was no wasted 1/8"" or 3mm left blank at the beginning, and indeed there is not one visible in any picture.  When they arrived, I immediately discovered that they do, in fact, have that 'feature'.It may not matter to you, in which case these are really quite nice, a bargain for the price. But if it does matter, well, I told you so.",3
B07DP25SRG,Was looking to purchase a metal ruler because I got tired of using the plastic ones that kept breaking. I stumbled across this product and instantly bought it. Product came exactly as described and I loved the design of the ruler. Would 10/10 recommend to anyone else looking to buy a metal ruler!,5
B07DP25SRG,These rulers are worth every bit I paid for them. Definitely would recommend these.,5
B07DP25SRG,"Perfect, better than expected. Easy to read.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I really like that they are made of steel, and being able to have 8"" and 14"" lengths is a big plus.",4
B07DP25SRG,They work and they are very affordable but the edges are kinda sharp. I am using them to measure heights on guitar strings and I worry they will scratch up my guitar. But I admit they are very affordable.,4
B07DP25SRG,"I keep these rulers at various locations around my shop. I generally find the handy, but for one deficiency. The scale doesn't start  at the end of the ruler. There is about 1/8"" of space between the end of the ruler and  the start of the scale. I think this makes it more difficult to make a measurement, particularly of something projecting from a surface. Otherwise, they are perfect",4
B07DP25SRG,I would've liked all the rules to have a hole to keep them always together in a ring. But having all the sizes is really nice.,5
B07DP25SRG,Everything I needed in a straight edge.,5
B07DP25SRG,"This set of metal rulers is stiff enough and heavy enough to stay put when placed on paper or some other object when measuring. It has inch and CM scales with multiple subdivisions. The inches scales go all the way down to 64ths. The CM goes down to half MM. There are inch to mm scales on the back. Overall, this is a very good, precise set of rulers. It meets my expectations for rulers.",5
B07DP25SRG,"They are exactly as advertised.  I will never need to purchase another ruler the rest of my life.  Perfect in every way.I will address two comments I read when choosing this product.  ""It was bowed"".  Easy to correct, simply hold the ends and lightly press the middle until it lies flat.  This is thin metal, this will always be an issue that takes like 1 second to correct.  ""It has sharp edges"".  The edges are nicely rounded, but I did find there were a couple that needed a little finishing off with a file to improve them.  I used the file I use to trim off my dog's toes.  A metal fingernail file would also likely do the job.  I could have left my chair to get my regular file in my shop.  Bottom line, easily corrected.I threw away the plastic case for each file, but that is personal preference.  In my view they could save cost by eliminating these.  My preference is to eliminate plastics as much as possible.  I also threw away my old totally inferior in every way plastic ruler.  Not sure how I am going to use the included mustache transfer, but it is too cool to just throw away.",5
B07DP25SRG,"I love the fact that there are four different lengths, 14"", 12"" 8"", and 6"". They are divided into increments of a normal ruler with 1/8"" with the added increments of 16ths, 32nds, and 64ths. They also have the metric measurements on the other edge. My only complaint, which really is immaterial, is the fact that they are made for a right-handed person, which can be a problem for a left-handed person, but we are known to be adaptable like that you know. It is hard to live in a right-handed world and we have had to adapt our whole lives. I Love Them! Can not wait to put them to use.Contrary to what others have said about them having too sharp edges and that a person could get cut on them, and not to let a child use them, they have got to be joking! I love the fact that they have nice crisp edges so that you can draw a nice crisp line. And that crisp edge makes it so much easier to measure accurately. Who wants a ruler with rounded edges?! That only creates confusion. You wouldn't get accurate readings nor would you get that nice line, it would be pretty wobbly... I  would definitely recommend these rulers. They are in the professional group.",5
B07DP25SRG,needed it for little every day measures - like that I could get a 6 in and a 12 in sent via 1 order,5
B07DP25SRG,"The best feature of these rulers is they stay in place due to the cork backing, when you put them in position. Every other ruler I've had slides around when I use it to guide a straight line. Plus the 6"" ruler is very narrow, which fits in my pen case.",5
B07DP25SRG,"They seem like fine rulers but, if you're expecting the measurements to start at the flush edge on the ruler as I was, and as is shown in the pictures, know that these have an annoying rounded edges and a buffer before the zero point.I specifically ordered these because I wanted rulers to measure depths and the pictures unambiguously show that these should work. What I received do NOT work to measure depths, however.",3
B07DP25SRG,"I was looking for a multi purpose straight edge / ruler in both metric and inch marking, and found them with Mr. Pen. I have many times wanted a good quality metal ruler to measure with and make cuts with a razor knife or Xacto knife. Aluminum straight edges get nicked and bent too easily, and won't work for me. These stainless rulers are perfect! As a finish carpenter and hobbiest I need precise instruments to carry out my work. These will do perfectly. Others have mentioned marks not going out to the very end of this ruler to check depths of router bits or cuts on a table saw. There are tools made for that purpose. Any draftsman knows a good ruler has its ""zero mark"" moved in from the end of the ruler in case it gets dropped. This kind of damage will ruin a good measuring device in a hurry. This is a professional tool and not for children. My kids know better than to touch my drafting equipment. I buy them appropriate tools for their crafting or school projects. I love the clearly marked measurements, and they are bold enough to read down to the smallest increment, even with my aging eyes. So glad I got these, and so glad I found Mr. Pen!",5
B07DP25SRG,They get the job done but are very flimsy.,4
B07DP25SRG,"Overall U really like these rulers, all messurdment appear to be spot on.Only issue I have is the the 14"" does not have a hole to hang like the other sizes do.",4
B07DP25SRG,"The two largest sizes are great. Only one has a hole in it and I wish they all did another I could hang them together. Two of them have a rather sharp and bent end that I cannot correct, so it doesn't really lay perfectly flat. Being so inexpensive this is to be expected. They are easy to read and that's a plus.",3
B07DP25SRG,It is really good! Great quality and unbeatable price. material as expected and feels durable. Highly recommended!,5
B07DP25SRG,Great buy for the amount of rulers with measurements in them that makes it easier when in need of quick numbers. Love this brand even more def recommend these for school/work.,5
B07DP25SRG,"Because my husband is frequently griping that he can't find his ruler and must borrow mine, I decided to fix the problem.  But also, my own rulers were acquired as a late 1970's undergrad, and the engraving is wearing, so I bought two sets.  I am so pleased.US and metric measurements are both necessary in our modern world, and these rulers have both.  A big plus for me is that I am a hobbyist beader, and often work with very small seed beads.  Sometimes being able to measure to half a millimeter without dragging out a caliper is really handy, and these rulers support that level of detail.",5
B07DP25SRG,"These are nice study rulers  but the edges are really, really, sharp! Be careful. Maybe the machining will have changed if you buy them but mine, I would actually consider dangerous if you grabbed them by the edge.",3
B07DP25SRG,It's a metal ruler. I use I for hobby crafts and baking. It has conversions on the back...what else can I say. Need a cheap metal ruler without corking on the back? Buy it.,5
B07DP25SRG,"Excellent Rulers, just what I was looking for!",5
B07DP25SRG,Very thin very flimsy and came bent,2
B07DP25SRG,"I needed a ""straight edge"" metal ruler for ripping paper for journals, etc. And I wanted a small one, the 6"", for measuring pockets, tags, etc. as a larger one can be cumbersome in a small working space. I have only used the smallest one so far, but the other 3 seem just fine. I have two comments: First, on the 6"" one, there are burrs on each side at one end. Felt them right away. Not enough to cut the skin though. I will just be careful. My second thought is about the measurements. The front side shows inches and cm's. Yet the reverse side where conversions are shown, it lists inches and mm's. I am assuming cm and mm are the same measurement. But why not make them the same? Thanks for making these!  The price was certainly manageable.",5
B07DP25SRG,"Nice weight, stay in place while marking. Easy to read.",5
B07DP25SRG,Stainless steel and feels solid.,4
B07DP25SRG,"I love metal rulers but they are not all created equally. These rulers are very easy to read even dowb to the smallest measurements. I really like that both metric and imperial increments are included. Some of the jewelry patterns I use are metric. So to help some of my metrical challenged friends, I can make an  easy conversion just using the ruler. These rulers also travel well. Even the six inch ruler doesn't bend or warp when crammed into my craft bag. These rulers would be worth having even at a higher price, but the price I paid makes owning the rulers even better. These rulers should be in everyone's tool box or craft stash.",5
B07DP25SRG,"These are easy to read and or convert metric to standard without flipping. Decent thickness  not as flimsy as some. The only negative is measurements start about 1/8"" from end of  rulers not the very end. Not an issue for me tho.",5
B07DP25SRG,I love this set of rulers! I can have one at all the places where I need them. Nice quality and the little mustache sticker is a bonus!! Nice inches and centimeters on a sturdy ruler. Great value!!,5
B07DP25SRG,"These rulers are nice as far as the text on the ruler and the quantity you get for the price. The part I question is the claim of "" stainless "" which is printed right on the ruler,The first  picture is a small plastic box with some small magnets in it. The box is attached to the ruler , through the plastic sleeve and through the plastic box . It is also being held upside down. I am aware that some stainless will attract a magnet (400 series medical grade ) and low grade 300 series. But the magnet is really attached to this ruler and they act as if these are not stainless. Time will tell if they begin to rust .Overall a decent value, but I am not sure about them being stainless steel?",3
B07DP25SRG,Just as advertised,5
B07DP25SRG,Price and product are good.  Smallest size is not as narrow as my previous rules.  Also it did not include the plastic sheath.  I think a more rigid box would be good although mine were undamaged.,4
B0CX2TYWF1,"I am using this for paper crafting and it works great!  definitely recommend and the price is terrific.  been using it for a few months, it's convenient to have wider adhesive for more coverage and quicker completion of projects.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This double sided adhesive is perfect. I am a demonstrator for a rubber stamping company and I mostly make hand stamped greeting cards. When I have fine, die-cut pieces I need to adhere to a card, glue can be very messy and I've found this double-sided adhesive to be quite excellent.You apply this product to the back of the cardstock piece that you will be cutting from. As you roll it off of the roll, you expose one side of the adhesive (just like a roll of tape) which you then stick to the back side of the cardstock. The other side of the tape has white paper backing. You roll off and cut whatever size you want to place on the back of your cardstock. Then after you die cut your piece, you just remove the white backing to reveal the adhesive and stick the die-cut piece down. Easy Peasy.I've used several different brands of this type of product all of which have come as ""sheets"". For the sheets, you cut the sheet to fit the cardstock piece, peel back one white protective layer from the cut sheet revealing the adhesive and then attach it to the cardstock. Then after you die-cut your cardstock, to attach your die-cut piece you have to peel off a second layer of white backing from the other side, which creates an additional step.The sheets have areas at the edge of them that help you get the backing off but when dealing with left over pieces of the sheet that aren't near an edge it can be difficult to get the backing peeled up. The two layers of backing on the sheets are very thin and that makes it hard to remove it and sometimes the adhesive wants to come up with the backing. So besides the additional step of peeling off an additional layer of backing, it can sometimes be frustrating getting the backing off properly.Additionally, sometimes the adhesive itself that the sheets use is not always the best quality. It can be stringy or thin and peel up easily when removing the backing or not be very strong, giving a weak hold. Sometimes I've found it doesn't cut well or at all around fine details (so you end up with adhesive where you don't want it like in small fine holes) and then it can end up just as or even more messy than if you'd just used glue.I have found that the 2 inch size of this product in tape form is so much easier to work with than the sheets, especially for smaller die cuts, and it seems to be the perfect size universally for what I need it for. But it does come in many different widths (including larger widths such as 3"" and 5"") and I do have occasions for smaller widths so I will probably order another roll that is 1"" wide which is $7.99.I have never had trouble getting the backing off of this product and the adhesive is perfect, just the right thickness and consistency and it bonds firmly and completely. The quality of the adhesive itself is excellent for my purposes. Adhesive quality matters and I have been very satisfied with the quality of the adhesive this product uses.And you get a lot! It will last you a while and you will waste less of it. I ordered it in January of 2020 and I still have a lot left. That is something I really appreciate about this product because I'm tired of companies that price gouge crafters. When possible, I avoid buying any products from companies who take advantage of crafters.This product is also neater to use and store as you don't have all the little left over pieces in different sizes to deal with like you do with the sheets. Virtually none of it goes to waste. It is easy and convenient to use. It was also reasonably priced at $12.99.Because of it's price, convenience, quality and functionality, I highly recommend this product and I will purchase it again. And to be clear, this is my own personal opinion which I was not asked for or offered anything for giving. I just like giving credit where credit is due and sharing what I think are good finds with other crafters!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"As many others have mentioned, this two-sided tape is really excellent. The adhesion is super on both sides, and it is indeed thin. It's easy to apply because it comes off the roll with one adhesive side exposed (which you apply to one surface), and the other side has the covering which readily peels off to expose the other adhesive side. I can't imagine a better two-sided tape for adhesion to two relatively smooth surfaces if you're after a very thin interface between those two surfaces. I haven't tried removing it after application, so I can't comment on ease of removal. But given how good the adhesion is, it's quite likely it may damage some work surfaces if an attempt is made to remove it after application. Very highly recommended, indeed!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This is some really solid, double-stick adhesive film for more industrial type applications. Any of my criticisms have more to do with the listing, which claims it is good for crafts like scrapbooking. First, I would not classify this tape as ""ultra thin."" It doesn't create a big ridge on most paper when applied, but the film itself is very thick and comes off in contiguous, thick sheets when you remove it. It's almost impossible to apply by tearing and it is so incredibly strong, I wouldn't risk gunking up my scissors with it.I also would say that listing this for things like scrapbooking and photography is way off base. This stuff is STRONG. I mean like this is the strongest adhesive I've ever encountered outside of two-part epoxy type glues. I have no doubt that you could probably stick light objects to the wall with this stuff and have it last. Because it is so strong and thick, it's very hard to work with. The only way you could cut it into neat pieces would be to stick it to a sheet of freezer paper or something and use a blade to cut it to size. Tearing it creates a mess because it wants to stick to your fingers, to itself, to any surface you have it on, etc. It will absolutely shred paper if you need more precision than a broad rectangular slice here and there. You can not stick things to it and then pull them off like a sticker. You can't really stick it to the paper, then tear it, like other double tapes for scrapbooking I've used either. And like I said, it's a very thick jelly like film and even though you can't feel a ridge under your paper, you can feel how much bulk it adds when you try to bend the page. I bought this primarily to stick things into my sketchbook without adding a lot of bulk to the pages, so it was not very useful for me.All that being said, with the right application - that is if you need some heavy duty adhesive - this is the right stuff for you. This is by far the strongest tape I've ever encountered. You get a lot of tape in one roll too, so I would consider it a bargain. But I don't think it's very good for light paper crafts at all.",4
B0CX2TYWF1,"Super easy to use, amazing adhesive. Thin enough for crafting and easy to cut if you want smaller/thinner pieces.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"We're using this tape on both an indoor and outdoor project and it's holding up well on both. There was an issue in peeling off the protective side of the tape but found an online video that did the trick. Handling the tape is tricky once you get the backing peeled off, but depending on your project and a few trial & errors, you can make it manageable.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This tape is absolutely amazing! I have used it so far for cardstock project and it sticks very well. My main reason for purchasing was to see if it adhered well to glitter cardstock and it really does! The roll comes with a lot so you can make a ton of stuff with just one roll. Once you cut the piece and place it on to where you want it to go you easily remove the top layer is with a weeding tool! Pro tip here lol... Thank you for an awesome product, just purchased another roll!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,Helped me set miter guides for a table saw crosscut jig. a bit tricky separating the tape but worked great for my needs.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Very thin double sided tape,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Works great and very study hold,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Bought this tape to put on corners of dining room chairs to keep cat from sharpening claws.  IT WORKS!!!,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Hard to remove backing,4
B0CX2TYWF1,I used it for card making there is plenty on the roll works great!!,5
B0CX2TYWF1,I have found countless uses for this tape through out the year and continue to surprise myself with the little ways it helps out. The roll is a bit bulky but lasts a really long time. The price is right for how much you get. Will purchase again when this runs out,5
B0CX2TYWF1,I use these for scrapbooking and card making stuck great. Good value,5
B0CX2TYWF1,This tape is great for woodworking when you need a double sided bond for jigs and lath work. The adhesion is excellent as long as the roll is kept clean and not sitting out in a dusty shop. Moisture will also degrade this tape so be mindful where you store it.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,I make books and this double sided tape is extremely sticky and strong. It works great for holding my cardstock onto my chipboard. I would highly recommend this tape.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Love this double sided tape it was perfect and helping me to Matt my art prints safely. It is archival and acid free, which means I can depend on this feature so harmful chemicals do not to leach into my photographs or artwork.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"After a LONG search, I believe I have found the best double-sided tape in the world. It's just incredible. Amazing. Awesome. If you know, you know. If you've fought other double-sided tape, this will make you nearly cry for happiness. It tears by hand and yet sticks amazingly well. Don't let the white color fool you; there's a wonderful cover strip to enable you to put the tape down easily, and then it pops right off. Thank you, thank you.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,I used the tape to make Christmas list binder.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Goid quality,5
B0CX2TYWF1,It seems to be holding up well. I used it to attach pretty paper to the back of my kitchen cabinets.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,I got this because a user said it could be die cut for cards. I have not had much luck. It cut a basic shape but I wanted it for intricate dies. I did not cut for me. It is able to be torn and is sticky. Just wish I could use for purpose I wanted.,4
B0CX2TYWF1,This wasn't strong enough for my purpose. Probably a great adhesive for paper/pictures. I have had to reapply several times and will be searching for a stronger adhesive strip.,3
B0CX2TYWF1,"This ripped the poster we were trying to hang on the wall. I was looking for a thin double-stick tape rather than the thick one we used previously. Unfortunately, when we put the poster up it immediately fell and ripped where the tape was placed.",3
B0CX2TYWF1,Used in a craft project. It worked great,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This is my go to tape. It is easy to use, durable and perfect for my crafting projects. I have purchased several times.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,This tape is easy to use. Backing removes easily. Unlike others that are a real pain. I have already purchased more,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"LOVE THIS STUFF!! It is basically like glue in tape form. I would say it works as well as glue but you are able to be super precise with it and don't have to worry about any of the mess that comes with glue. It is similar to working with duct tape until you remove the backing after you adhere the first side. Once you remove the backing it is like a super thin strip of glue that remains. But although it is thin it has some pretty serious grip! I was concerned because two sided tape can have a weak hold strength but this stuff is comparable to duct tape as far as hold goes. It's basically like if you were able to lay down the super sticky glue  like backing of duct tape and then remove the ""tape"" backing leaving just the adhesive in place. So yeah it's basically duct tape without the ""tape"" lol. Hope this helps",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I bought this tape to make washi tape from fabric scraps. That part works fine. I also tried hanging a museum brochure on the wall and it keeps falling off. I also used the two-sided tape under plastic shelf liner on my window sills to keep clean from cat paws. It doesn't hold the plastic down at all. In both cases where the tape doesn't stick, it's cold. Maybe that affects the stickiness.",3
B0CX2TYWF1,A good comparison to scor-tape and a great value for the price.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,This is very good tape. It's easy to apply and stays on. I definitely recommend,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I've purchased sticky-backed sheets in the past to put on the back of paper before running my dies through my Big Shot machine. The sticky sheets have been expensive ($1+ per sheet) so I've used them sparingly to back only the most delicate and hard-to-glue die cuts.This product works amazingly well. I'm using it to make an intricate wedding explosion box with lots of detailed cutting. This product sticks really well, is easy to run through my Big Shot machine and peels off easily.  It makes a high-quality sticker and you don't have to rub the back to get the sticky side to adhere well. There's no sticker edge residue either. It works well with both paper and cardstock. Plus the price can't be beat. It's my new favorite card-making tool that I plan to use in all of my future card making projects. The only ""negative"" is that you have to be extremely accurate with laying down the die cut because you can't do any readjusting once it's laid down.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Excellent quality, tons on the roll, 1/3 the price of the name brand craft tape. The perfect amount of sticky.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This tape is for mounting posters, signs, paper, etc to surfaces. Or scrapbooking. Or as a temporary hold when working on a construction project.I used this tape to stick the following things together:-installing DIY weather strip (made out of a sliced up yoga mat) to a painted wood door frame.-sticking many 16"" x  20"" pieces of cardboard to a vinyl floor for a cat who loves tearing up cardboard-repairing laminate on furniture and kitchen counters that had begun to peel away-putting DIY felt pads on the bottom of chair legs so they wouldn't make that BMP-BMP-SCREECH-CLUNK when the chairs are dragged out to sit on whilst consuming a possibly delightful creamy pasta or maybe just some dry Triscuits and 3 olives.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I use this for crafts especially where materials don't stick well to each other, like contact paper to cardboard, etc. I'm on my 2nd roll and plan to use in card making. Non stick scissor blades work great or periodically clean regular scissor blades with rubbing alcohol or goo remover. Its a large roll and goes a long way. I plan to order in other widths to avoid having to cut to size.",4
B0CX2TYWF1,"I use this adhesive for my crafts. It's easy to tear with my thumb nail, peels easy and the sticky stays put. When I was looking I compared and felt the value on this was the best out of the brands I researched.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,Works well for holding leather together while punching and stitching.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I needed a tape to adhere felt to a wood project.  I had been using Terrifically Tacky tape, but was not able to get it in the 1"" size any more.  I looked at lots of different brands/types and picked this because of the price.  It did an excellent job!I used a sharp stylus to remove the paper side off of the tape.  An exacto type blade or straight pin would also work well to get a corner up to be able to pull it off.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,This is my go to tape for framing and mounting artwork. I use it practically everyday.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"The tape itself works really well, but trying to get a strip off can make you want to burn down a village. Sometimes the tape will just kinda fold onto itself, and it just makes you sad. A tip of advice for this tape is using scissors, and cutting of the tape but leaving the little plastic strip it's attached to intact. That will make it so much easier to get the tape off.",4
B0CX2TYWF1,A perfect product to use when joining together multiple mats over a photo. Super easy to use. Great adhesion.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Strong tape and easy to apply.  Definitely don't want to be having to pull this off or reposition after you have placed it on something.  I used to remount a poster to a framing board and it worked really well.  Would recommend for similar purpose.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Despite being cheap it works so I recommend it,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I repair, rebuild, and restore travel trailers.  Once a travel trailer is more than a couple years old interior repairs are extremely difficult to accomplish because exact match interior vinyl-covered wallboard and seam tape is impossible to find.  Fortunately, if you know where to look you can ""recover"" pieces of interior wallboard to use for repairs.  This leaves the matching seam tape, which is used to cover the joints in the wallboard.  With this product I can make my own seam tape from scraps of leftover interior wallboard.  I rip 1"" strips of wallboard on the table saw then peel the vinyl wall covering off of the cut strip.  Cut a length of this double-sided tape, apply it to the back of the 1"" vinyl strip and I have matching OEM-style interior wallboard seam tape.  I am very, very pleased with this product!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This tape will come in handy for a lot of things. At first I thought there's no way I would be able to take off the top protective film because it's so small and thin, but it turns out to be pretty easy. I can't speak to the long term adhesive qualities but I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what it can do.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I was a doubter about this, but took a chance on the purchase. But it was a lot less cost than the standard acid-free scrapbook sticky tape, but how could all those reviewers be wrong?Wow, the tape jumped to the top of my USE THIS list! It holds against vinyl, wood, and all sorts of difficult to adhere to surfaces. It's super thin and super useful!You don't have to test which glue to use. You don't have to wait for the glue to dry. There's no mess. You cut, stick, peel, adhere.And it's ready!I'm so glad I bought it!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I bought this tape because it is permanent, two sided, and extra wide. I use it to mount my embroidery pieces before I frame them. I used to use narrower tape and sometimes you could tell through the fabric where one strip of tape butted up against another one and although it was supposed to be permanent sometimes a small area or two would loosen and pop up. I saw this wider tape and decided to see how it would look. Not only are there fewer strips but they lay evenly together and they stay stuck down on both sides.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,I purchased this as thin double sided tape to secure my Thin Optice glasses case to me cell phone. Works great.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Love it,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This tape was recommended by a fellow craftsperson. I've been using it to cut and adhered cardstock die cuts to cards. The backing comes off beautifully with little effort. Today, I tried it on a piece of vellum and was blown away! I couldn't seen the tape through the vellum and it adhered the vellum to cardstock very well. I'm impressed! (I'm assuming the ""easy to remove"" rating is for the backing, so that's why I gave that issue 5 stars. Once it's placed, it cannot be removed, from what I can tell.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I always have a roll of this tape on hand. It adheres to most any surface very well, but can typically be removed pretty easily by rolling it off. It also tears very easily and makes for simple use in a variety of projects.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,this tape really like this tape it holds well,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I used this tape to mount my diamond art painting to the mat when I framed it. The tape is nice and thin and works great. The width is big enough that you can use it for bigger hangings, or split it down the middle with scissors and use it for narrow areas.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,I recently started making greeting cards out of photos.  I needed something to stick the photo onto the card that would be thin not to raise it but strong enough to keep it on the paper.  This did the trick.  Highly recommend.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review because it would be PERFECT if there measurements on the roll that showed how much you are cutting off.  I have to measure each time and that's a little annoying.  So I hope the manufacturer reads this and adds that.,4
B0CX2TYWF1,"This is a case where reading the Amazon reviews & answers to questions really paid off! This double-stick tape is great, if used properly! Otherwise, it's very difficult.1) Cut a piece LONGER than what's needed2) Mount the sticky side to whatever you're using the tape for with extra tape on BOTH ends3) Use magic tape to strengthen the ends, because they tend to curl with the backing removed4) Use a razor knife to LIGHTLY cut the backing5) Peel off backing6) Use scissors to cut off the excess on both ends5) Cut off excess, and you're ready to apply the other object to be taped.I know this sounds complicated, but I tried it and it works!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,It is very sticky but it's not transparent so can't use wit acetate because tape shows through.,4
B0CX2TYWF1,"Quite sticky and adheres well, I don't consider this to provide a permanent bond.  Nice hold while sewing or riveting and the 1/4 inch width is nice.  Quite a lot of tape for the price.  The very wide role is a rather awkward to use.  If I ever need to buy more, I'll probably look for a smaller roll purely for ease of use.",3
B0CX2TYWF1,This double sided tape is great for adding mylar or character balloons to a design. It holds very nicely and allows you to tape balloons in tilted or erect positions.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"This tape just works, and it's nice and wide and easy to use. I had to put it along a door jam and them place foam over it to fill an air draft, and it performed perfectly. And there's plenty more tape in the roll to use on many other projects. Maybe more expensive tape would be better, but this worked perfectly.UPDATE MONTHS LATERJust used this for a much bigger door in our main entry where the rubber door seal was peeling off. It make the repair super easy and feels very strong. So far this tape is really helping with small repair projects.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Needed some thin double sided tape for basic mounting purposes. Small bits and pieces here and there, but nothing too important as I did not hold out to this tape being able to hold anything down. After a while I decided to see how this tape would hold up securing speakers, coaster carrying dragon statues and the like to my desk, and honestly I was a bit surprised. If I grab anything that I taped down using this and try to shake it off, my entire desk will move and 'wobble' before this even budges.Still wouldn't use it to support anything on a wall, ceiling or anything similar, but to keep most smaller objects from moving I'll be glad to have this around.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Very thin, sticks very well and can hold together different materialsUsed with acrylic, metal, wood and glass",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"If you are looking for a strong adhesive double faced tape this is the one to get!  Just make sure you set up your project correctly, there are no do overs!  I put markers on my project to ensure tape placement was correct. No need to worry that your project may fall apart.  I made 80 customized double sided wine tags with 4x6 gold mesh favor bag filled with chocolate taped in between (like bag topper).  I hung the chocolate filled wine tag to a bottle of wine & gave as Xmas gifts.  It was a big hit!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,This is thin but sticky. Easy to take the backing off. 100% my go to dbl sided thin tape. Recently used for my corvettes lettering and worked perfectly.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,Unfortunately not great for upholstery in car. Doesn't want to stick to the sponge roofing.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"When doing a set up for an event, I would not go without this tape. This was our 'go-to' to attach banners, signs, tablecloths etc for an outdoor event on a relatively windy day. We didn't cut the white backing paper with each section used. Instead we just peeled the backing and kept the paper continuous and cut the two sided tape. It wasn't that difficult to remove the paper backing but when in a hurry setting up, it's even faster to unroll what you need, stick it down and pull back the white backing but just cut the two sided sticky tape. We used the tape to mount paper posters to foam board for signs and this tape worked perfectly!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Like the purchase, would buy again.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Not exceptional stick, but good.",4
B0CX2TYWF1,"Well, not a substitute for 3M Positional Mounting Adhesive !The adhesive is very strong, and holds on to the carrier release paper more than the back of a photo.  Adhesive stays on the 'release paper' and just peals away from the photo.When I put the adhesive on the backing board and tried to remove the release paper, again it stuck to the 'release paper' and de-laminated the backing board !I might use it for woodworking or something.....",2
B0CX2TYWF1,"Thank you, your item works great!  Though you!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"At first, I hated it, kept doubling back on itself, etc. Wasted a lot of cardstock and adhesive tape. Then I used this item - Reynolds Kitchens Pop-Up Parchment Paper Sheets (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K282KY4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (sorry couldn't figure how to do hyperlink); do not throw away! They are reusable, so no waste. The adhesive doesn't stick to it and you are essentially making your own ""Stick It"" Type Sheets. Perfection. This adhesive is ultra thin, so causes no bulk in sticking embellishments to your cardstock. Highly recommend.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,Hard to apply with only one side covered with non stick material covering.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,This is really good double sided tape and hold up great. I do a lot of crafting and I found it excellent for all my crafts and home use. I will buy it again..,5
B0CX2TYWF1,The adhesion was perfect. Let me put back a small thin strip of aluminum on the food compartment tray. The edition was perfect and very easy to use.,5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I use this tape to hold my work to the spoil board in my cnc engraver instead of clamps, that always seem to get in the way. It adheres very well and I have not had a work piece move while engraving. Removing it sometimes is a little time consuming, but it's worth it not to use clamps. I will buy this tape over and over!",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I absolutely love this tape it's super strong and durable, however once you attach it to something it does not move. (When it says permanent, it means permanent lol). And I've had the unfortunate experience of paper falling on it while making a craft and I had to start from scratch because the paper wouldn't come off at all and it just gently fell on it. So the adhesive is strong so make sure you don't have anything around it that could accidentally be attached. Great product.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"Very tacky/sticky, no complaints. I'm using this to hang wallpaper strips (rental property) and this has done an amazing job thrust far. This was super easy to cut, scissors needed, and a quick press to adhere. It is thin but it is sticky, by far better than double-sided tape. It has held up for the past two weeks and I haven't had to reapply or repress to adhere. I will update if anything changes, I hope this helps :)",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I have metal spice tins that have lost their adherence to the magnet material they came with. I am using this stuff to redo the magnets. It requires some doing to get all traces of the old stuff off, but this stuff sticks fiercely. Easy to cut to fit when the backing is still on. Sometimes it takes a bit of effort to get the backing off because there's no perforation or pre-cuts in the middle of the strip. The sticky bit is extremely thin, it is not like foam tape. It might not be perfect for every application, but it's great for mine.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"The key to use is never try to use it with both sides exposed at once.I used it to make removable vinyl wallpaper permanent. It is thin enough that at doesn't show through.The tape is tearable by hand, which was nice since I was doing a project where I could have used three hands.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I use Tim Holtz Colorize dies all the time. This tape is a crafter's dream come true. Easy to use, I gave it a 4 because the large roll is slightly heavy. The release comes off with your fingers unlike most double side adhesive sheets. It is by far the most reasonable double side tape for your money. I am so glad I found this.",5
B0CX2TYWF1,"I needed a wide width, double-sided tape for some paper craft projects I'm working on, and this was the perfect match for what I had in mind. The tape bonded very well to both paper and vellum, and in my opinion is indeed permanent, as when I tried to pull two pieces of vellum I had taped together it was basically impossible to separate the two sheets without something tearing. The white paper can be a tad tricky to lift up with just finger nails, but I use tweezers, so it isn't a problem for me.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"This is a Great quality, fast drying and easy to use resin. It's orderless but still use precautions and protective shields for eyes and hands of course. It mixes really smooth, I bought the 8oz and a little goes a long way but I'm going to purchase the biggest size they have available I just finished working on some Moon Phases that are on hour 2 of drying. When they are completely dry at 24 hours I'll add additional photos and Update my Review so far I really love this brand. The bubbles disappear after about 30 minutes which is great and you can still use heat for an Extra glossy finish too. You can see in the last photo of the glitter shall bubbles that are lifting as it's drying because that the last one, I just finished 10 minutes ago. But if you look at the small moon farthest last one on the mold you can see it doesn't have any air bubbles. Definitely, will be buying some more of this product.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"This is the first time that I have used a product like this.  It is easy to use and looks amazing.  I used it as a sealer and brushed it on some ornaments that I made.  It is self leveling and cured in about 24 hours every though the temperature was lower than recommended.  I had no bubbles, and the finish is strong and glossy.  The size was perfect for my small project, and the cost was very reasonable.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"The bottle says the demold time is 4 hours, but when I demolded at four, it was extremely soft, like deforming under its own weight soft. However, demolding at 24 hours gives excellent results! Why not say to wait 24 hours?Despite the high demold time, it does have a really short work time. Be sure you have everything set to race to getting the resin in your molds once you combine the parts. After about 5 minutes, it gets so thick it's difficult to work with. By 10, you can forget it.However, once you ignore the instructions in the poorly translated booklet, this is a truly excellent resin. These dice, pressurized at 40psi, came out completely and totally clear.The short work time might cause problems if you don't have a pressure pot, though. Bubbles will get trapped as you stir like a mad man to beat the timer. If you're curious what mold I used in my example pour, it's from Druid Dice on Etsy.TL;DR, work time of 10 minutes, demold time of 24 hours pressurized, beautiful results.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"It does take a little longer to set than others, that just gives more working time.When mixed with ink colors, it didn't like it, it became hot to the touch and cured super fast. But the results were good, so no complaints there, just don't touch after you pour color into the mold.If your on a timer, this is not the resin for you.If you enjoy pouring and can allow for proper setting & curing time, this is definitely a good product.I went through 72 oz. With ease and awesome results.  After 9 hours, it was hard to the touch but my nail was still making a dent. So I let it sit a little longer and I was able to demold in 17-18 hours with no bends or warps.It's clear and bubbles are practically non existent.I wouldn't recommend for beginners since it's not as ""quick drying"" as others but would definitely recommend for anyone familiar with epoxy resin process. I just bought 2 gallons! So I guess I liked it. :)",4
B07S1MLQMJ,I used the whole bottles for a project and it was easy to mix with no bubbles. I still ran a torch over to ensure no bubbles but dried in 24 hours as stated and worked great.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Very strong epoxy! Needs time to cure, as described! Great price for the quantity they give  you, I am happy with it!",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Exactly as described.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"The instructions are very clearly translated from a different language based on the grammatical errors present. The product itself is simple enough to use without reading them, though.It will ALWAYS cure completely within 24 hours as long as you do the following:A: Mix equal parts of A and B (by VOLUME, not WEIGHT) otherwise it will never harden completely.B: Stir until it looks blended enough, then stir some more to make sure, otherwise it will not harden in certain parts.C: Do not mix in cheap plastic containers or any containers you plan on using for anything except resin pours, as this stuff heats up when curing, and is very hard to clean off surfaces once cured (although it is very easy to clean as a liquid)It will stay as liquid for ~20 minutes after mixing, then will slowly gel and solidify over the next 24 hours. Do not mess with it until 24 hours have passed, as it may not be completely cured in the bottom or middle of your project.When it dries fully it is very tough, it took a few good swings with a hammer to shatter a small test chunk I had made.It is also perfectly clear once it hardens, and bubbles are not an issue unless you are making taller/thicker resin pours, as the product stays liquid for long enough to allow bubbles to escape naturally from smaller setups.Even with colorants added (food coloring/acrylic paint in very small amounts) it still set up completely, it just took much longer to cure. Using resin-compatible dyes would solve this but I had to use what I already had on-hand.Additionally, this stuff is kind of sticky but that is to be expected of any product like this, and this product is actually very easy to clean up as long as it has not begun to harden.All in all, besides the lack of quality control regarding the instruction booklet, this two-part resin is great for small craft projects and repairs, and I'd definitely recommend it if you don't need a large quantity of resin. If you plan on using this kind of stuff frequently, I'd recommend buying larger containers.",4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Pretty good resin for the price. I make resin dice and have tried a few different types of resin. This one was good, still hardened well and the dice turned out like I hoped, however, be aware that it has VERY low viscosity... you have to stir for FOREVER, at least 3 or 4 times as long as the other resins I've tried to get it to any kind of ""thicker"" consistency, and even then, it's pretty runny and thin when you pour it into the mold. It does harden and dry well, I always wait about 24 hours before demolding no matter which resin I'm using just in case, and they were always done by 24 hours usin this resin. It wasn't ""crystal clear"" on the one clear set I tried to make, but not opaque either.TIP FOR NEW DICE MAKERS (or other resin crafters) to eliminate/minimize BUBBLES: Heat is key. I don't have a pressure pot or a heat torch, but I've found a system that works quite well for me to minimize or completely eliminate air bubbles. The first thing I do before even setting up to start crafting is I place both the resin bottle and the hardener bottle (both bottles, part A and B) in hot water. I personally just use the hottest water that comes out of my tap - not boiling, but still hurts to touch. Make sure when you set the bottles in the water, the water level goes all the way to the top of where the resin sits inside the bottle. You can set something heavier on top of the bottles to keep them down if they start to float. Now, while they sit there for 15-20 minutes, get everything else ready. Make sure you warm up your molds and silicone pouring cups too. The idea is to get everything at a warm temperature before casting, eliminating bubbles that come from temperature differences. I've found the easiest way for me to warm up the molds and the pouring cups is by placing them inside a ziploc bag, closing the bag tight to keep water out, and then immersing them in a bowl of hot water, the same as the resin bottles (hottest my tap has to offer, weighing them down with a glass or anything else heavier to keep them submerged). Once I've let them sit for a while in the hot water, I'll take the molds out and quickly but THOROUGHLY make sure they're super dry. If your bag was airtight they shouldn't be wet, just warm, but I still always meticulously check that there isn't a single drop of water on or inside any of the molds or pouring cups. Water droplets WILL lead to air bubbles. Then while the molds and cups are still warm I take the resin and hardner out of the warm water, follow proportion directions while pouring, and then stir using a wooden or silicone stick. Stir constantly and semi-slowly and ONLY in one direction if you can help it, making sure you're scraping the bottom and sides, for at least 5 minutes, depending on what your resin instructions say. Then let it sit for another 5-ish minutes based on your instructions. You add micah powder if you're adding color right around now and stir that in. When it starts to get thick (close to honey consistency) THAT'S the time to pour, if it gets any thicker before you pour it into your molds, it'll start to get too thick too fast while you pour. You want to pour it right before you hit honey consistency - it should be thicker than it started off, but not getting hard to stir. Pour it into your molds (pour slowly) and work quickly to fit lids on etc. Between heating your molds, making sure they're completely dry, stirring slowly and thoroughly, and following the directions for your particular resin, you should be able to eliminate all or most microbubbles!",4
B07S1MLQMJ,Good material to use an easy labels for directions,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Just a little slow at setting.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Following the instructions is important especially when they tell you to use gloves & protective clothing, make sure you do it all. This stuff even after mixing is very sticky and can easily get everywhere if you overfill your form or accidentally touch the mixture. The mixture is very clear and it is easy to misjudge how it is filling a form especially if that form is also clear. Be sure you take extra care and fill your form a little at a time then look at it from all angles to see how it is filling the form.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Good product. Fast delivery.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Worked great,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Works great for my fishing lures very clear and no bubbling,5

B07S1MLQMJ,Easy to use,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"This epoxy speaks for itself. my project came out clear and shiny, this levels really well with minimum bubbles.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Used for an art project. Solution dries crystal clear.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,I have yet to use it,5
B07S1MLQMJ,I've used this product many times and it works well.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,great epoxy for strength but took at least 45 hours to cure. if you are pressed you time this product will not be a good choice. if you don't care about time and just need a high strength epoxy this product will be for you.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,was clear,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Perfect for a very clear project. I made coasters with this and they turned out great. Very low fumes. No bubbles.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,I have used this in the past and have not had any problems.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Work good make sure there no bubbles before using,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"I have used 5 min. epoxy for years and was used to fast curing time.  This is not 5min. epoxy and can take up to 24 hrs. to harden. I even tried a blue light UV to speed up the drying time and no luck. If you need a faster curing time ,try 5 min. epoxy.  This product could be ok if you are not in a hurry to finish a project. It might have a good side to it, but I have not found it. If you are not pressed for time this might work for you. Slow to Cure !",3
B07S1MLQMJ,"I think I've reordered this kit 4 times. It took me a bit to figure out how to make resin bowls, but I finally got it. The key is to use 1.1 epoxy resin/hardener. I'll probably order again if I need more for Christmas gifts.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Easy to use. Used in a thicker craft application. Clear of bubbles and floated into application well. Hardened thoroughly.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Mix very well but you need to definitely get the bigger ones if you plan not to use the full bottles for one painting. Recommend for people that paint on smaller canvases! And get a heat gun!,4
B07S1MLQMJ,Good price. Delivered on time.Easy to use. Good Result.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"It works great. For the beginner, exact measuring is required if you want it to set well. I used this to do some ding repair on my SUP surfer. It sets and cures well. It sands out good also. It claims it does not yellow but only time will determine that. I've done ding repair over the years and have used many products and this works well.  For buying in a small quantity this is great and really affordable.",4
B07S1MLQMJ,"I like the product dry pretty fast and clear but do not use it on natural flowers, the resin will Fry them up other then that good aproxy resin",4
B07S1MLQMJ,"This was one of my favorite projects and I love seeing people reactions when they notice it.No stain used for this type wood. I mixed the epoxy 50/50 in cups and applied it with a paint brush. Bugs got into the first coat. I had to sand them out rub it with isolpropyl alcohol and apply a 2nd coat.I did not have to sand or buff the 2nd coat.I basically mixed 50/50 applied with a paint brush and let it dry. That simple and it's beautiful.I also have used this product to repair motorcycle fairings, it's a very strong epoxy.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"I love the combo , makes it easier . I was able to create a few things with this and its durability is impressive . A few bubbles not too bad . Easy Removal from the silicone . It did not take to long for it to be ready , I usually let it sit for the next day and done easy .",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Using this product for a wood slab project, making a shelf.  I needed to fill a knot hole that is about 250 mL (~8.5 oz.) in volume.  Also had a few smaller cracks to fill.  Very easy to use, mixing and pouring, with plenty of working time.  In the pics, I'm showing the reverse side of the hole and then the top side after havng done half the pour.  I didn't use pigments for this as I wanted it to remain clear.  I'm including something in the middle, so doing in halves.  Will definitely be looking for this product for future projects!!",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Easy to work.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,I followed the instructions in the manual and my tumblers came out perfect.  No dry spots no fish eyes. Must let it sit for a few mins after mixing to warm up a bit.  Excellent price and value. I will order again,5
B07S1MLQMJ,I use it on lures and it works alright. Comes out clear and it's solid. Makes the paint look wet when cured. Only thing I don't like with my use of it is it doesn't like to cover the whole lure evenly but I haven't found a cheap one that does yet.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The instructions are easy to follow. Be sure to wear gloves, and cover your work area before starting. I heated the sealed bottle of resin in a pot of water on the stove, measuring the temp so it stayed at 120 degrees for 10 minutes. This ensured that the resin would not be cloudy. Then I poured the resin into a plastic cup with a handle and added equal parts hardener (you don't have to heat the hardener). I stirred SLOWLY with a wooden stick for 3 minutes, then poured the mixture slowly onto the mosaic table I was trying to seal. It seemed a little slow to level on its own, so I used a very long straight piece of poplar to help spread it evenly over the mosaic tile surface. The table was sitting in a cardboard box so I wouldn't accidentally drip epoxy onto my floor. The only thing I neglected to check for were bubbles, which I didn't notice until a few hours later, too late to make any fixes, as this is only workable for 30 minutes. In the future, I would use a heat gun or hairdryer to get rid of bubbles while I'm working. I also heard you can spray ethanol over the surface to remove bubbles? Anyway, I'm very pleased with the finished result, and I plan to place the table outdoors after 72 hours of curing is finished.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Worked Great,5
B07S1MLQMJ,This was a great product. Not very easy to clean. So make sure your work area is protected. No bubble. Cure time and hardness perfect. Worth the value for money.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,I used this to make some crystals and the first time around I may have over heated it bc this stuff started setting up within minutes. I didn't heat it for the next two batches so they had some bubbles but nothing bad.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"This Epoxy did a great job repairing a broken glass pedicure bowl.The bowl was not cracked, instead it had a piece broken out as if someone had dropped something small but heavy into the bowl.  Someone had attempted to fix the glass bowl with silicone, which simply cannot be expected to create a water tight seal.The prep work is so important when trying to create a water tight bond.  I cleaned out all the silicone, I then used a small stiff wire brush to ensure no silicone or silicone film remained, cleaned the area very well with acetone followed by alcohol.This resin was easy to work with, didn't have a strong smell, bonded well to the glass bowl and cured crystal clear.  I let it cure for 24 hours and it looked great.  I then let is stay for 3 days before filling the bowl with water and checking the bowl for leaks.  So happy to find the area I patched was indeed water tight!Highly recommend!",5
B07S1MLQMJ,The first mix was perfect. The second use came out a little foggy.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Order arrived quickly and well packaged. Easy to understand instructions. The suggestion to heat the epoxy resin before mixing to prevent bubbles was a good one. Better than applying heat after applying. Make sure if the defect is completely through the board, apply some painters tape to the underside to prevent the epoxy from dripping through to the surface it is on.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Product mixes nicely, no bubbles, and sands down clear.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Much smaller than I anticipated,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Final Update:It's about 48 hours after testing and it went very well.  The cured epoxy is very solid and crystal clear.  This  epoxy cures slower than any I have used in that past, so you have plenty of time to work the little bubble out, which I did not bother with for the test.________Update:After a quick reply from JANCHUN, I warmed the resin bottle in 140F degree water as suggested.  In a few minutes the resin was crystal clear, and it has stayed that way for 24 hours now.  I will update again after using the product.-----------Original review:The hardener is crystal clear - you can read through it in the photo, but the resin isn't even close to clear.  I have worked with 5 or 6 brands of epoxy in the past, and there is no reason that both parts should not be clear.",4
B07S1MLQMJ,Very pleased with this product.  The info on the bottles are too small for me to read even with glasses but thank God there is YouTube!,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Very good resin. It firms up rock hard, alot harder then my other resins I tried !",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Being new to resin, I only had a few wishes in mind for this product:1. Easy to use2. Sheerness of the finished product, and3. No yellowingI was not disappointed. This resin was incredibly easy to use! The directions were veey straight-forward and easy to follow. I made several different pieces, as you can see. The curing and hardening process took about 12 hours for the small circle coaster, 18 hours for the rose globe, and the square coaster is still hardening 24 hours later. I can handle it with no problem, but it is still a bit bendable. From what my resin-experienced friends have told me, that's normal; some resins take several days to harden completely.The bubbles could have been eliminated with a heat torch, which I did not know at the time.Now, let's talk about the sheerness of the resin.The globe is perfectly sheer except for the bubbles (which could be due to my inexperience in pouring into a spherical mold). If you look at the circle and square coaster corners, you can see that they are not perfectly see-through. However, that could be due to me not running a heat gun over the resin. As a beginner, though? I'm very happy with how they turned out. I poured the coasters in two layers. The first layer was halfway up the side of the mold, with the leaves carefully placed on the surface. I waited for about 45 mins before pouring the second layer on top of the first.No yellowing has occured, either. As an added bonus, if you use a silicone pouring cup, cleanup is a BREEZE. The resin snapped out of the cup so easily, and the same with the molds. I did not use a releasing spray in the molds beforehand.To sum this up:Ease of use: 10/10Sheerness/Translucency: 9/10No Yellowing: 10/10Clean-up: 10/1010/10 would recommend.Happy crafting everyone!",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Really quick shipping came in good packaging no damage. No problems with the product when used I made my first chess piece set out of it I would definitely buy again,5
B07S1MLQMJ,I learned better do multiple thin coats rather than I thick,4
B07S1MLQMJ,Fast cure time and excellent for light DIY projects.,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Never used this stuff before but was dying to try it. I had these two fake fiddle leave trees  (awesome from Amazon) that I keep outdoors. I got cheap rocks to cover the top to make it look nicer (thanks Dollar Tree). Problem was, each time it rained i had to dump out the water without all the rocks coming out which was a pain in the a$$.  So i got this to put over the rocks and level out the contents to the rim of the pot.  I let these cure for 4 days and they look great. Let's hope it works.  One of each bottle was JUST enough for this little project. Some stones are poking through but that's because it was above rim level i guess. I should have removed some rocks before starting i guess. Fingers crossed this solves my problem!",5
B07S1MLQMJ,I bought the 8 fl. oz. because I wanted to make coasters. I was able to make about 4 hand-size coasters and the kit came with instructions so the whole process was easy. This was only my second time using resin but I can say that the quality is better than the one I bought at Michael's.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Performs just as expected, but sometimes dries a bit soft. Comes out perfectly clear and is very beginner friendly!",4
B07S1MLQMJ,Not happy with this brand. I know how to mix and remove bubbles because I've used another brand before for my craft projects. This brand still left bubbles when it set. Didn't do anything different from what I do with another brand.,2
B07S1MLQMJ,It was VERY sticky so definitely use gloves and use plastic cups so you can throw it out easily and it made my clay soooo smooth so definitely recommend,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"When we revieved we did not notice that one of the bottles was leaking until it was set out on our dining room table. Table luckily not damaged. Significant amount missing from the clear resin bottle, no longer have equal amounts of resin vs hardener, which equals to getting less product overall since it is a 1:1 blend. Not worth it for the faulty container.Edited to change rating: Seller contacted us to try and send us another bottle to replace that one, but we already started using both bottles so did not feel that it was okay to accept a replacement. Changed to four starts because I appreciate that they tried. The product itself is working fine, no problems with that.",4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Very durable, very clear. Directions were easy to follow. I used this epoxy set for a few different projects and all have come out successfully done and very pretty. Highly recommend for small projects.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,This was purchased as a gift for a friend who wanted to try his hand at creating an object with an insect inside the resin.  He used the product and was happy with the results.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Worked perfect to coat a small table.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,Dries quick and crystal clear.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"I have tried a few epoxy resins......one that was my favorite until I tried this one......and I love this one.  It's easy to use and has beautiful results!  No fumes, no odor (at least not that my sensitive could detect), and non-toxic.  To be on the safe side, you could always wear a face mask (like we all wore during the pandemic), and I definitely suggest gloves to keep it off your skin because it's sticky.  As for this product, it is also the least expensive of those that I have tried.  If you are new to using this product, I suggest you search YouTube for Janchun reviews and demos so you can see for yourself before buying.  I think you will like this brand of epoxy resin.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Works great,5
B07S1MLQMJ,The only comment I have is the size of the bottles...there's enough for several projects but I'd like to see different (larger) size options.  A mixing tray would be a nice add on option for these when shipped as would some tinting mixes so that the glaze could be tinted (colored) to suit preferences.  One note I would make is that the first application of glaze seems to bubble significantly...use of a heat gun solves that they say.,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately, that's not the case. The product causes fish eyes in my tumblers, even though I prep them correctly and use gloves when handling. I have to make more product then needed so that I can ensure full coverage, which causes waste and it still fish eyes and causes lumps. I'll be throwing this away and looking for another fast set epoxy.",2
B07S1MLQMJ,"I don't know much about epoxy resins. I bought this to coat LED light strings (mounted in channels) to protect them from the elements. It worked GREAT. The resin set perfectly clear, very hard, and demonstrably waterproof. My application was, at most, 1/4"" thick, so i can't speak to how well thicker applications would work.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,looks great,5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Mark the caps, A and B, before you unscrew them.It was my first time using epoxy. It worked really well.I made a spongebob themed fish tank. I couldn't find Patrick's house for sale. I made his house out of clay, made the antenna out of tooth picks and glue. I primed and painted it, then poured the epoxy over it. I let it dry for a long time, each step. It is pretty purple, but I am happy with the results.Then used a paint brush to paint some epoxy on a bird house, just for fun, and since I had a lot of epoxy sitting in a plastic bowl that I didn't want to throw away. That worked well and ruined the paint brush wich is now part of the bird house.Next, I would like to mix acrylic paint into the epoxy. I read that 2 parts this and 1 part acrylic paint will make a good waterproof paint, and I really don't need to try, to tell it will work well. This started to get dry, sticky and gooey after 30 minutes to 1 hour.",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"Product was easy to use, and worked perfectly",5
B07S1MLQMJ,I guess my mistake an did not look at the ounces the bottles Were VERY VERY small would hardly make two coasters and fkr that price is ridiculously expensive for the size,2
B07S1MLQMJ,"This is an excellent pouring epoxy that is a very smooth, self-leveling product.  A beginner will need to be very careful to block all leaks in the mold or target surface.  This product will continue to creap and level itself for a few hours after the initial mix.  Be careful and you will create a wonderful project!",5
B07S1MLQMJ,It worked,4
B07S1MLQMJ,"Easy instructions , ease of use , great value for the money , fast and of good quality , clear as glass when hardened .",5
B07S1MLQMJ,"It's been drying for two days, but still tacky",3
B07S1MLQMJ,"I really like using this stuff, it's very easy to use just following the simple instructions and it dries in 24hrs hard as a rock",5
B07S1MLQMJ,Seemed to work well on wood repairs,5

B0006BAWUQ,"I needed this to organize documents for my business and to clean up my receipt binder. It's super sturdy, easy to use, can do multiple papers at a time and everything works smoothly and efficiently. Exactly what I was looking for!",5
B0006BAWUQ,"I have been using a paper punch that is 70 years old. It works but will only punch 3 sheets, so time for one with more capacity. I also use card stock and the old one could not handle it. This one is easy to use and can be latched closed.  The manufacturer should get clever and offer these in bright colors so they would be easier to spot if it gets misplaced. Black has a tendency to become invisible. I'd go with a bright fluorescent orange or yellow.",5
B0006BAWUQ,This is a great addition to my office. Always have the hardest time whole punching documents. This item is awesome. It can do up to 40 sheets in one punch and the push down handle is very easy to use. Highly recommend.,5
B0006BAWUQ,"This was very nice and extremely sturdy! I had four reams of paper that had to be three hole punched and placed into binders and this handled it perfectly! I was a little nervous at first because you really got a kind of break it in and get a little strong on it but after that first probably half frame of paper the rest of it just flew right through! The only thing I would suggest is about every hundred or so pages of paper, you'll notice it starts to jam up a little bit and so you'll have to go in and clear them out just under the Nubs where you slide the paper in. But really still worth it!",5
B0006BAWUQ,"I was hunting for a good quality hole puncher and ended up getting a way larger and industrial hole puncher than I need, but I still like it. It handles 20 pages easily and the holes are conveniently tucked away in a tray in the bottom. When it needs to be dumped, the tray is easily removed and replaced and the bar can be folded down for storage.",4
B0006BAWUQ,Great paper hole punch. Does about 20-25 at a time no problem.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Easy to use!,5
B0006BAWUQ,I think 40 pages may be a bit of a stretch but it easily handles 20+ pages with much less hand strain.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Does the job great,5
B0006BAWUQ,"This does a great job, but pay close attention to top/bottom alignment for close fitting binders.",5
B0006BAWUQ,Does a nice job and has a lock so that it can lie flat for storage.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Perfect for home user,5
B0006BAWUQ,excellent 3-hole punch.,5
B0006BAWUQ,It was great,4
B0006BAWUQ,It just works and works well.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Sturdy construction and good leverage to punch through multiple pages at a time make this one a keeper. Much like the ones I used successfully at work in years gone by.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Substantial item. Capable of good volume,5
B0006BAWUQ,As advertised,5
B0006BAWUQ,"Seems well built,  handles heavy duty card stock well,  very happy.",5
B0006BAWUQ,"I had a smaller hole-punch, but it would get stuck and was hard to use. This bad boy is big and clunky and works just great! I'm glad I bought it.",5
B0006BAWUQ,"It's a 3-hole punch, it does what it is designed to do.  My gripe with office products of today is that they do not hold up to daily use, like the products from our elementary school childhood pre 1995.  This unit is heavy in weight and big in size.  It is meant for heavy handed people like kindergartners and butchers.  Perfect for my house! This is a good hole punch for the money and if you can find the desk space for it, I recommend it highly.This review is current as of 11-30-23.  I will update this rating if anything changes.",5
B0006BAWUQ,I had an old one and it jammed up all the time. Purchased this one and it's a pleasure to use. A must buy,5
B0006BAWUQ,"I keep a couple hundred paper copies of lyrics and chords for my church praise band in a large 3 ring binder.  There are a few important factors to be able to maneuver and manipulate so many pages easily - the proper size of the binder, the style (shape) of the rings in it, and the ability to punch (and in some instances, re-punch) the pages easily with a punch which is not poorly made.  I finally got tired of the lightweight punch I had been using for a couple of years, and for a moderate price upgraded to this heavier duty model.  Boy am I glad I did!  I immediately re-punched the 200+ sheets I had in the binder to re-standardize the location of the 3 holes and hopefully allow the pages to flip back and forth on the spindles more easily.  This task took only a few minutes because of the 30 page capacity per punch with this unit.  Even with that many pages the punch mechanism worked flawlessly and after I was finished the pages did move back and forth more easily.",5

B0006BAWUQ,"I've been wanting to buy a 3 hole puncher for awhile now.  This is a nice little puncher & it works great, however it was not packaged well and the bottom tray which holds the paper punches was cracked on one end.  I had to tape it together a bit, but the puncher works great!",5
B0006BAWUQ,Heavy duty hole puncher. The best thing about this device is the adjustable paper guide which accommodates a large variety of paper sizes. So this is great for my sheet music which is larger than the regular paper size.,5
B0006BAWUQ,This hole puncher is so good.  Really sturdy with compartments for garbage.  I needed to do a lot of prep work for trial and this product made it easy.,5
B0006BAWUQ,pleased,5
B0006BAWUQ,"Feels like a miracle: cuts great, easy to push.  Works!",5

B0006BAWUQ,"Easy to use,very satisfied",5
B0006BAWUQ,I bought one of these for mysel a few months ago.  It is so sturdy and the action is so smooth that I donated it to my church and bought another one for myself.  Doubt I will ever need to replace it.,5
B0006BAWUQ,"Has good weight to it, punched through a 20 page file very easily.",5
B0006BAWUQ,Does it's job. No complaints.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Well made of medium gauge steel. Sturdier than expected!,5
B0006BAWUQ,this hole punch does a great job,5
B0006BAWUQ,"I used this hole punch off and on for a month and it worked well until today. The spring on the middle drill punch is jammed in a crunched position and will not return to its original shape, so the punching rod no longer elevates. . I took the bottom off and tried to press up from below or pry open the spring, but it stays clenched. I used  this for about 6 pages at a time, not 15 to 20. My return window has closed because I delayed before using it.",2
B0006BAWUQ,I use this to hole punch my sheet music. It works great every time.,5
B0006BAWUQ,"I was disappointed to open the box and see my hole punch had wear and scuffs showing I received a used product. However, it works great and I am impressed with its ease of use and consistency!",4
B0006BAWUQ,"This hole punch is wonderful!  I purchased this when my light-duty, old paper punch tore up.  My old punch would punch only five or six sheets at a time.  And even then it didn't want to release the sheets without me shaking the punch.  I am thrilled with this new punch!  It punches 30 sheets easily and releases them!  And the holes which it makes is larger than my old punch which will make turning the pages in a notebook much easier.  I highly recommend this Officemate Medium Duty 3 Hole Punch",5
B0006BAWUQ,"Easy to set to paper size, punches through easily.",5
B0006BAWUQ,quick to set up if stored down easy to use lightweight..,5

B0006BAWUQ,Works great! I needed it to punch holes in legal paper.,5
B0006BAWUQ,"Works fine but not able to puncture as many sheets as my previous, more heavy duty hole punch. Do like that can fold down for space saving storage.",4
B0006BAWUQ,"I had to tape the guide (ruler) in place at 11"" because it would be slipping between 10 1/2"" and 11"" and the holes had to be re-punched. The ruler should be tight so it doesn't slip. As long as I keep taping it in place it should be ok or maybe tightening the brackets inside will work. I wish the people at the factory would do a thorough inspection before releasing it to the public.",3
B0006BAWUQ,Works well if you need something to punch multiple pages at a time.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Works great! I use it for punching holes in large vendor portfolios.,5
B0006BAWUQ,"This punch is a BEAST! Literally the ONLY thing I could bother complaining about, is how shallow the catcher tray is, but it's really a non-issue. It's hefty, sturdy, cuts punching time down drastically compared to what one may be used to, and it's a great price.",5
B0006BAWUQ,This is a well-built unit that is not too big but does the job. Very well built and very sturdy. Great for home office. Good ergonomic design makes it easy to use and store.,5
B0006BAWUQ,This gets used in my classroom every day. We copy in the work room and bring babconto the classroom to punch the holes. You can do so many at a time and it punches easy and clean. Such a time saver,5
B0006BAWUQ,"I bought this so I could punch my kids' construction paper projects. Needed it to adjust to a paper size larger than the letter size and this does it just fine. Affordable, heavy duty, highly adjustable. Only complaint is that the little paper circles don't always go down into the holding tray. Not a huge deal, but can slow you down a bit & make a mess.",4
B0006BAWUQ,it worked,5
B0006BAWUQ,A convenient tool to help with those personal documents that need to be put in binders. And so affordable that I would purchase again for family members.,5

B0006BAWUQ,"I purchased this 3 Hole Puncher for my wife, who is a schoolteacher.  She thanks me for it regularly!  It is heavy, sturdy, strong and easy to use.  Nothing flimsy about this.  It is meant to do the job and does it well.  Also, a great value.  Highly recommended.",5
B0006BAWUQ,Easy to use.  Does the job.  Use common sense by punching only the required sheets of paper.  Easy to empty the bits of punched paper.,5
B0006BAWUQ,It's a 3 hole punch that works. Plain and simple. It folds easily with the locking clip it has.The one thing I wish it had was a way to actually lock the sliding bar into a traditional/standard hole punching position.,4
B0006BAWUQ,Right out of the box this 3-hole punch worked well.  It is super strong and can handle a significant amount of sheets at one time. It literally took me no time at all to punch out over 210 11x17 plan sheets for my project. It is built to last,5
B0006BAWUQ,"Nice sturdy and easy to use hole punch.  I know it is rated for more, but I have punched 3 or 4 sheets at a time, with no issues. The reservoir or area on the bottom catches the punchings, which makes use and clean up quick and easy .",5
B0006BAWUQ,Works great.,5
B0006BAWUQ,High quality and easy to use.,5
B0006BAWUQ,Much better than the little ones you use. Got for my kid to get organized while doing school at home so a few papers at a time. Not needing super heavy duty. But solid and works well. Very happy with purchase,5
B0006BAWUQ,didn't use it right away....was missing plastic piece on bottom that holds the holes that are punched.Works great otherwise.....chasing little paper dots all over!,3
B0006BAWUQ,"I like this but bought it used for a cheaper price. Came with a broken bottom that is unfixable and it's kind of a big area that's broken. It's sturdy though and works fine for a decent number of papers. If price were cheaper, would buy again new.",3

B000XAOSHS,"It dispenses like a white pva glue, dries to a clear soft rubbery film. Great for paper, I use it for paper theater kits from Ensky. If applied to paper and allowed to try, it makes the paper behave like a post it note.The applicator is craft appropriate, allows for precise application.",5
B000XAOSHS,"Tomboy Mono Liquid Glue is my glue of preference when I make handmade greeting cards. I use the small tip in order to give a more precise direction of where the glue is going. The great advantage of using this glue is two-fold: 1. I have the ability to slightly move the paper if I have it off center. I try to get it exactly where I want it, but if I am just a bit off, then I can quickly push the paper to the location I need it to be, and 2. This glue has latex in it and it holds extremely well. This means that it can hold paper, small wooden embellishments, sequins, etc. and they will stay where they are placed. If I get the glue on my fingers, I have found that it does not wipe off well with just a tissue. I have to wash it off with soap and water. But it DOES wash off (fingers, that is, I have not gotten any on my clothes so I cannot tell you if it washes off okay. The ability of the glue to securely hold what it is attached to, is quite amazing! However, if I want to take two pieces of paper apart, it cannot be done without tearing the papers. So, this glue is very secure. I also, noted that if any glue was accidentally oozing from under a piece of paper or embellishment, I could use a sketch eraser when the glue was dry, and the glue could be completely removed without any trace of the glue left behind. Just a note about children: I wouldn't recommend allowing children to use this glue unless an adult is helping them. It is very secure and it is not easy to get off skin unless you use water and help them to scrub it off.",5
B000XAOSHS,Awesome item for me to fix hotwheels pack.,5
B000XAOSHS,"This glue is very thick and effective, however, it was a little too thick for my purposes.  Also it is hard to clean off my hands and is expensive.  I was happier with Tombow Aqua....less thick and is easier to remove from my hands.  Also, more affordable.",4
B000XAOSHS,Works great for card making and scrape booking,5
B000XAOSHS,My favorite adhesive for stamping!,5
B000XAOSHS,"Dried clear, dries fast and holds tight! Best used for papercrafting.",5
B000XAOSHS,The only problem I had was having too much glue  for a small die cut.  This was the pen side. I will use a different bottle for small objects and will use this bottle for my larger objects.,4
B000XAOSHS,"If you are reading this review you may question whether this is a good adhesive.  I think it is based on my use to date. Whether it will still be holding my scrapbook layouts and crafts together years from now remains to be seen. I spent some time and money this year looking for better adhesives than I was using. I craft mostly with paper products, some fabric and lightly dabble in jewelry making.  No one adhesive will in any way be suitable for all paper or fabric crafts but I do get by with just two adhesives for jewelry making.  Its the paper crafting I took up a couple years ago that had me flummoxed & baffled. First I couldn't find the perfect tape runner for me. Nor could I find a liquid glue that would hold well without buckling paper or leaving unsightly residue where least wanted. Ditto glue sticks and glue pens. My early choices simply did not go down well, hold well or they left marks on my paper. I checked many Amazon and other site reviews before buying TomBow Mono and Beacon 3n1 Advanced Craft Glue. Both appeared popular so I bought them. Of the two, TomBow Mono is far and away my favorite. I gave it four stars instead of five because the small dispenser end has clogged to the point nothing comes out of it. It has clogged a few times before but fiddling got it to work. I'm soaking it upside down in water now to see if it helps. Tombow Mono does not buckle my paper! I think It will hold both short and long term. I am very pleased with the way it goes down, it's non-distorting properties and its hold. I am only disappointed that it's promising narrow tip is such a clogger. Maybe my first bottle is an exception. As for the Beacon 3n1 - my bottle dried up hard as a rock from the bottom up just after opening it. I got one use out of the entire 4 oz bottle. Total waste of money. Yet other crafters like it so there is always a chance that I received old stock that was dying before it reached my hands. As to the TomBow Mono's popularity outside of shopping sites- well let me tell you what I learned just last week. I was killing time instead of cleaning house watching End of 2014 Favorite Products of The Year YouTube videos. I watched an entire Video Blog Hop posted by die-heart paper crafters from all over the globe. Each video blogger boasts hundreds to a thousand or more subscribers. The most frequently praised adhesives were this green TomBow Mono, the big ATG Guns and ScoreTape. This TomBow Mono was far and away the most often mentioned liquid glue. Another TomBow in a blue bottle was praised a few times as well. These ladies are artists and experts. Therefore - I would value their collective expert opinion over my limited one. They swear by this TomBow Mono! I'm betting it may well be worth five Amazin stars but my tip clogged so I'm sticking to my four stars based on my first bottle.",4
B000XAOSHS,"I saw this used on a YouTube video with a couple of different card makers, and figured it had to be good. I wasn't disappointed!  I bought two, as I didn't know how long one would last. So far, I've made at least 50, and it doesn't seem to be done yet.  I guess the only improvement I could offer would be to have one little clear strip in bottle to know how much is left -- but for now, I'll buy two at a time, and know that I have the BEST stuff I've ever used! No odor, only need a LITTLE, and you can still move it a bit before it dries if you don't get something quite right.",5
B000XAOSHS,"I like the glue. It works just fine for my bookbinding and paper crafts. I have a problem with the nozzle sometimes. This one in particular would not flow out when I was applying it to my project therefore I squeezed the middle a little more and the cap puckered and glue was gushing from under the nozzle, from the top; it was going everywhere. I'm not heavy handed. I've been crafting for over 20 years and this is the only brand that gives me a hiccup from time to time and it's always a problem with that nozzle. Sometimes to avoid aggravation I transfer the glue to a different reusable bottle.",4
B000XAOSHS,"It does bind well and has the magical properties to give it the permanent bond or temporary repositionable capabilities.I've watched a lot of card making demo videos. Those ladies always seem to have zero difficulty with the glue or the dispenser. That later is what causes me issue.  They always seem to have immediate flow and it never seems be excessive flow. Not this gal. Have to wait and pressure squeeze it, to get flow. Then it blurps! out. Usually, if the area is big enuf for it, it does smear around well. But  I've been getting tiny paper shapes caught in deluges of glue. Really is jamming up this one card I worked on last night. I am thinking I might need to transfer this glue to some dispensers that have like a micro needle spout. Sigh.And this glue is super annoying to get on your fingers or out of place. Rubbing it into a more dry state is... Ugh. Annoying. Takes far more effort than other adhesives I've used. And causes a bigger mess.",3
B000XAOSHS,The glue that is very dependable in paper crafting,5
B000XAOSHS,Excellent product and excellent service,5
B000XAOSHS,"If you are a Scrapbooker, or a card maker, you definitely need some of this glue. It is very easy to use and works perfectly. I will definitely buy another one, or even more!",5
B000XAOSHS,I use this glue for my papercrafts when I need a small amount in a precise area. Works great!,5
B000XAOSHS,"This glue has a really great hold and will definitely stay put wherever you place it! Only 4 stars because IF you do get any of this Anywhere else than intended, ( fingers, etc,) it is a bit messy and Really Sticky. And not in a good way. Not a clean feeling glue, but a strong hold one at least. I like the size of it to hold onto. I also like the dual sided options to it. Great tips!",4
B000XAOSHS,when using the wide tip it does get a little messy but the small tip is great. it adheres good,4
B000XAOSHS,This is my go to adhesive for making greeting cards.,5
B000XAOSHS,I have always used another brand (in the blue tube) to restick my cutting mat for the Brother and Cricut machine.  This glue makes me use less and is stronger.  I love it.,5
B000XAOSHS,Love this stuff. I only ever use the smaller end of the applicator. I have never had the tip clog up on me. I find this easy to control as far as amount and works great for papercrafting.,5
B000XAOSHS,Great product for paper,5
B000XAOSHS,One of my favorite adhesives. Flows easily and dries fast and clear. Great for my paper crafting needs.,5
B000XAOSHS,This glue works well and dries within 10-15 seconds.  Only complaint is that it can leave some moisture residue if you're not careful,3
B000XAOSHS,I like this little tube of glue It sits on my desk Where I craft Not a bad price I will definitely order more,5
B000XAOSHS,This is a glue I have used for years in my crafting.  Love it.,5
B000XAOSHS,The best glue to use when making cards. Never leaves lumps or bumps.,5
B000XAOSHS,Live Tombow products.  Use it for my card crafting.  L ways good quality.,5
B000XAOSHS,"This works well.  It stays liquid for a short time to allow for replacement, if necessary.  Then tightens up to become a very tight bond, impossible to separate 2 sheets of paper after it's dry.  Will purchase again.",5
B000XAOSHS,"The bottle is encased in a plastic wrapping - the wording on the ""bottle"" is actually on the ""wrapping"".I had to hold onto the backing of the packaging just in case I had trouble using it or remembering the product name.  I have not used it yet.  I did see a ""Tombo"" product for a rolling adhesive.  This is not a ""Tombo"" product but I hoped it would work okay.When I took the smaller cap off, glue began to leak out immediately w/o any pressure and it was standing ""upright"" (the small end up).I'll see how it works, but since it was a bit too happy to supply that glue when uncapped, I'm not sure how that will go.  It seems a bit ""watery"" and uncontrollable upon first observation.  I removed the larger cap and it did not leak on its own - we'll ""see"".",4
B000XAOSHS,"Crafters use a variety of glues - everyone has their favorite, but this is mine. I love that you can let it dry and then it acts as a sticker to apply your creation to windows, doors, etc.",5
B000XAOSHS,I love this product,5
B000XAOSHS,"In gluing die cuts down, invariably some of the glue makes it to the front. This glue stays stickyy when dry and it leaves a shine which I cannot always erase.",3
B000XAOSHS,"Have tried may glues, and this one is the best.  Will buy again",5
B000XAOSHS,"Thi s glue is working very well right now.  My usual problem is after it has been open a couple of weeks, it gets clogged up.  This particular brand has been highly recommended.",4
B000XAOSHS,This works great for making cards together!,5
B000XAOSHS,Tombow is a great adhesive.  Apply and attach immediately for a permanent hold or let it get tacky and then attach for a temporary hold.  It does it all.  The price was good and shipping was very quick.,5
B000XAOSHS,So far so good,5
B000XAOSHS,I learned that this was a good glue for crafting. Now I'm glad I bought this glue. I've used it for several different projects and I'm very pleased. It's perfect for any project that you can think of.,5
B000XAOSHS,This was a great product to work on my crafts with.,5
B000XAOSHS,"This glue dries clear but remains sticky. That's its claim to fame. It never gets un-sticky so you can use it to place items together and then pull them apart-- like tape. It's very cool if you need it but it's a nightmare if you didn't know this so read the reviews carefully. The dried glue is VERY sticky and it's no joke that paper with this on it might tear when you slap in down and then try to pull it off. That kind of thing demands planning.So if you can use a glue that never loses it's stick, this it it.",5
B000XAOSHS,Well worth it.,5
B000XAOSHS,"This is my go-to glue for liquid adhesives used in paper art work.  I make a lot of cards and this stuff gives you a little ""wiggle working time"" as well as great adhesion.  I'm not a fan of how the nozzle clogs from time to time.  Furthermore, I love the dual application feature:  one narrow hole and one flattened, angled surface for spreading glue evenly.",5
B000XAOSHS,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I am unsure if my tube was exposed to freezing temperatures during transit, or was very old, or exposed to heat, but mine wouldn't express when I got it, I took the tip off, cleaned with warm water, got rid of some semi solid glue in a ring around the cap base, but there wasn't a plug in the tip and with great effort some dry chunky cottage cheese-like glue comes out.I've heard only good things so I know this isn't normal, but there are no returns for this product so I don't think I can go through amazon for it unfortunately.I still included it in my testing/comparison experiment against art glitter glue, bearly art glue, and super glue gel on cardstock/brushed metal finish paper/glitter paper.Surprisingly, this glue still had the second fastest holding/tacky speed and was strong when it fully dried. The bearly art glue was the best, the art glitter glue was strong but allowed for too much play and took 4x as long to set as the others.  I'm not sure why I'm allowed to return the art glitter glue and not this, but I want to give it a second chance I just don't know where to buy it in person.The two ways you can use it- as wet glue for permanent fix or application for removable tacky attachments is something that sets it a part from many other adhesives and is why I still want to include it in my arsenal.Update: a few weeks later I took a risk and got another one via subscribe and save. This one was perfect and smooth out of the package and it's a great glue. It's just a shame I can't return and get a refund for the useless first one.",3
B000XAOSHS,"This is the best holding glue I have ever used in my craft making! I highly recommend it.It works on wood, cloth, foam, leather...the list goes on!!! If you are a crafter I recommend to you to add this or replace your current glue for this!",5
B000XAOSHS,"Very easy to come out, a little goes a long way..very happy",5
B000XAOSHS,Use it all the time in my cardmaking.  Love it,5
B000XAOSHS,Very easy to use,5
B000XAOSHS,"I use this mainly for the repositioning ability. I put a layer on an old wooden ruler, wait for it to dry then attach a miniature to it to paint. When I'm done I just pull the miniature off, and use parchment paper to cover the ruler until I need it again. It works great for this.",5
B000XAOSHS,"I'm a card maker and when I glue something, I want it to last and Tombow  does.",5
B000XAOSHS,"This glue is great for card-making or any paper crafts.I almost always use the pen tip and have learned to store the bottle ""upside down"" in my colored pencil jar, (with the pen tip on the bottom) to keep the glue from clogging the tip.  This works like a charm for me.And if some of the glue seeps onto your cardstock, just blot it with a scrap of wax paper and you won't have a tacky spot to deal with.",5
B000XAOSHS,"My favorite glue.  Very strong adhesion with many things, paper, card stock, cardboard, small plastic things like ornaments and more.",5
B000XAOSHS,"Tombow Mono Multi Liquid Glue has become my go-to glue. As a professional artist and instructor, I use a lot of glue! Tombow Mono works well on a variety of art projects including mixed-media, collage, card making, art journaling, scrapbooking, and all types of paper crafting.The glue is formulated so it can be used as both permanent and repositionable. For a permanent hold, stick your items together while the glue is still wet, then allow to dry. If you want the ability to reposition your item, allow the glue to dry tacky before sticking your items together. Glue dries clear and has virtually no odor.The green and white bottle stands up nicely, and is the right size for holding in your hand. It has two tips, one on each end. One end has a fine point tip for precision gluing. The other end has a broad angled tip for adhering larger areas. Although the bottle might initially seem small, it actually lasts quite a while, as a little goes a long way. A must-have for artists and papercrafters, this glue will not disappoint!",5
B000XAOSHS,This glue works! Bb,2
B000XAOSHS,My problem with this glue is that it stays sticky. I won't be repurchasing.,2
B000XAOSHS,I prefer using this glue rather than glue runners. It gives time to move paper before it sets.,5
B000XAOSHS,Love the larger size.,5
B000XAOSHS,This is my favorite glue for crafts and greeting cards. It's easy to use and unlike some other glues allows me enough time to get get things where I want them before setting.  You can also allow it semi-dry and then use it like a glue dot. I store mine in a little jar upside down and since I use the small size the most of the time it's always ready to go.,5
B000XAOSHS,"This is a wonderful glue for card making.  It is easy to control in terms of quantity and a little goes a long way.  I store it upside down and it is always ready to go.  While the container seems small, the product lasts a long time.",5
B000XAOSHS,Love this for cardmaking and paid less,5
B000XAOSHS,Great product.,5
B000XAOSHS,Comes out in globs.,3
B000XAOSHS,This glue is so much better than tape runners  Everything stays stuck for a long time.,5
B000XAOSHS,Great product.,5
B000XAOSHS,Easy to use. Goes on light. Easy cleanup,5
B000XAOSHS,This is the first time I have bought this particular glue. I started making cards and it works great for that and the intricate little pieces too. It dries fairly fast. And sticks like glue.,5
B000XAOSHS,You can use a blunt tip for a larger areas to glue or the tiny tip for a smaller areas. Great to  have this convenience and one bottle..,5
B000XAOSHS,Great glueWorks really well for my craft project,5
B000XAOSHS,"Easy to use. I make my own greeting cards & this works in my projects. I have noticed though, after a couple months it tends to lift.",4
B000XAOSHS,HAD TO FIX WALLPAPER COMING OFF WALL...PUT A BEAD OF GLUE DOWN SEAM AND WIPED OVER WITH DAMP RAG AND IT IS PERFECT....TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO DRY,5
B000XAOSHS,"What a lot of reviewers seem to have missed is that this glue is repositionable **because** it remains sticky after it dries. If you want your paper adhesion to be permanent, you need to let it dry with the pieces stuck together, but if you want to be able to change it, then only put it on one side and let that side dry before putting them together.",5
B000XAOSHS,I love the double ends with fine nozzle and a broad spreader. Also find it very useful to use as repositionable glue. Just leave to dry them stick down your item. It peels off easily if you decide to move the item.,5
B000XAOSHS,"I MAKE GREETING CARDS AND USE A LOT OF GLUE.  THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER.  THE GLUE STICKS TO YOUR FINGERS AND GETS ALL OVER THE PROJECT YOUR CREATING.  I HAVE TO USE ""GOO-GONE"" TO GET IT OFF MY FINGERS.  WILL NEVER BUT THIS BRAND AGAIN!  i'M CHANGING BRANDS TO NUVO GLUE.  IT DRIES CLEAR AND DOESN'T STICK TO YOUR FINGERS.",1
B000XAOSHS,I have used this glue for a couple years for scrapbooking and crafting. Easy to use as a dauber as well as pinpoint amounts.,5
B000XAOSHS,"I have been using Tombow glue for many years, it is my go-to crafting glue.",4
B000XAOSHS,"I've tried other brands for various reasons and I always come back to using this one.  Versital, great adhesion, and dries clear!",5
B000XAOSHS,"This glue has some great features.  It holds well when used as a normal adhesive where you put the two items you are gluing together right away.  It also acts as a repositionable glue wherein you can apply the glue, let it dry then it will hold another item, say a sequin, but you can remove and replace the sequin.What I don't like about this glue is that it seems to constantly get plugged up in the hole.  I am always sticking a pin in to release it.The glue has two applicators, a detail hole which is about the only one I use, and a larger applicator on the opposite end.I would recommend this glue to anyone who papercrafts as it works very well for me and I'm sure you would like it too.",4
B000XAOSHS,"One of mine dried up, but the second one is working good.",5
B000XAOSHS,I make cards and this Tombow glue is easy to use and stays put after it drys.,5
B000XAOSHS,"You have to be super careful not to get it on your hands.  It will not come off easily.  Even after washing my hands with soap, I often have residue still on my hands.",4
B000XAOSHS,Makes using glue that works simple to use and no mess,4
B000XAOSHS,"I am a scrapbooker and crafter.  This glue was specifically recommended in one of the tutorials I was following for a scrapbooking project I'd been working on.  Now I know why it was recommended.  I'm already on my second bottle.  It works VERY well.  I love that it has the ability to stand up so you don't have to wait (as long) for the glue to drop down -- that is, if you're using the larger tip.  That's another awesome aspect of this glue -- it has a smaller pointed tip for gluing as well as a large, flat-head that's at a diagonal for applying glue to larger spaces.  I just used this glue within recent months, so I can't say it holds things together for years, but I imagine it will definitely hold my items together for a long time!  Recommended!",5
B000XAOSHS,Works great,5
B09BBHBZMG,"I like to make personalized magnets with my laser cutter. I've used quite a few sheets worth already, and they work quite well! They aren't super strong, but so far every magnet I've made has no problem staying on a fridge - perfectly strong enough to hold and proudly display a kid's piece of art.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I use these to convert my favorite stickers into fridge magnets. The magnet isn't super strong, so don't expect it to hold paper notes. However, it is able to holds itself well as a fridge magnet.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I loved it! It worked great for making magnets, and has held the pictures on quite nicely, and they have a good grip of not only the stickiness, but to the white board as well. I thought it was surprising because of how thin the sheets are, but they hold up nice. I paired it with the Mr. Pen whiteboard, and it works great. It's a good price for what you get.",5
B09BBHBZMG,Bought these to make a surprise birthday photo montage for an elderly relative's refrigerator. Fairly easy to use but once you get the photo on there there is no moving it! Magnets are pretty strong but could be slightly stronger.,4
B09BBHBZMG,"I bought a chore chart for the fridge, but it didn't come with a magnetic backing (it had some dumb lil adhesive dots that didn't work). I got a pack of these and it worked perfectly. On my second try. The first one has some slight buckling, but that's my fault- go slow and be careful! It cut nicely to size and was everything I was hoping for. The adhesive is strong and hard to redo, but seeing as I wanted a somewhat permanent backing, it's perfect! I even have a bunch of sheets leftover and it feels nice to have them with my craft supplies. :)",5
B09BBHBZMG,Great magnetic strength and really sticky. I used these to turn stickers into magnets. The paper is light weight but very sturdy. Did exactly what I needed it to do. Now my sticker collection can be used and moved.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"I love these You can cut them to any size you want. I put pictures on them and put them on my refrigerator the sticky back works great. The magnetic part works great not for heavy objects, but for pictures. Lightweight stuff works wonderful. Definitely. We'll buy it again.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"It's so simple to do and gives my doodles somewhere else to go other than a book. I put the drawing on, cut it out, and clear coat them a few times and absolutely love it.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"These sheets are a nice size as is or to be resized to apply to pictures, crafts, ect.  I  used them on pictures and photo ornaments to place on fridge.",5
B09BBHBZMG,Use these for craft dies they work very good,5
B09BBHBZMG,Love that I was able to convert this garage banner into a magnetic one. These magnetic sheets with sticky back adhered to the fabric very well.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"These magnetic sheets really stick to walls and anything with reason, like photos, pictures, etc. will stick onto them and also peel right off without wall damage. Really excellent.",5
B09BBHBZMG,Seems to work as advertised handy to have.,4
B09BBHBZMG,"Very easy (and quick) to use. I peeled the backing halfway and set the photo(s) and then continued, smoothing it out as best I could to avoid air bubbles in the backing. However, a couple did have ""bubbles"" but that did not interfere with them sticking to the refrigerator.I am going to be using them to make not only both Hanukkah and Xmas gifts, but also for other occasions. They also make a nice ""add-on"" as you can ""slip one"" into a card when giving a gift with a card.And yes, I will be purchasing more.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"They're not industrial strength, but if all you're doing is light arts and crafts, they do the job fine.",4
B09BBHBZMG,"Wanted to stick photos and cards on my fridge.  These magnets sheets were easy to cut to size, were just the right thickness, adhered nicely to photos, and really organized them nicely.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"Im a bit for an artist, so I thought it be fun to make some magnets and it works perfectly!! Easy to use and I cut it with scissors!",5
B09BBHBZMG,These are wonderful ..Perfect ..i will be getting more ..,5
B09BBHBZMG,"Between the mini phone printer and the mini camera, these magnet sheets have come in very handy. Thin enough to use a paper cutter and the magnet is strong enough to stay on the fridge. Cut to size makes it versatile in choosing any size picture to make it a photo fridge magnet. Highly recommend and will likely buy again. Fun stuff.",5
B09BBHBZMG,I used these magnetic sheets to attach stickers to in addition to adhere some postcards to for refrigerator magnets. They have a pretty strong magnetic force.,4
B09BBHBZMG,This item is of great quality I will buy again soon Fast delivery thank youDenise,5
B09BBHBZMG,"These magnet sheets a super strong.  The adhesive side is super sticky and the magnet side sticks great.  Overall, a great deal.",4
B09BBHBZMG,Got these to turn all my son's school pictures into magnets. Easy to use. Very good quality.,5
B09BBHBZMG,these are perfect for what i wanted them for. very happy with them,4
B09BBHBZMG,Addressed a need that I had for my business.Great Price! Highly Recommended! Five Stars!,5
B09BBHBZMG,great buy,5
B09BBHBZMG,The full sheets are perfect. They are sticky and adhere well. Good value. Delivery went well. Seems like a great company.,5
B09BBHBZMG,These came quickly and worked perfectly! Will definitely look at this company again for my crafting needs!,5
B09BBHBZMG,"These magnets are much more powerful than I thought they would be. I bought them for a very specific project, but they're strong enough to use for pretty much anything, within reason. The adhesive is also high-quality and very strong.I purchased them to use with two Displate posters I have. If you're not familiar with Displate, they're basically just posters made of metal. They come with a one-time use magnet. I moved and needed another, and these magnets worked like a charm.The pictures, in from left to right, are of the magnets, the magnets holding the posters I just mentioned, and then the magnet holding an Xbox 360 Steelbook case, just to give an idea of what they're capable of. The posters weigh a few pounds each and the magnet is strong enough that as soon as I get the poster close, it basically pulls it out of my hands.TL;DR: buy these magnets for any project- within reason- and you won't be disappointed.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I bought these 8-1/2 x 11"" magnetic sheets to try to organize my thinlit dies that I use for cardmaking. Specifically, I thought I would try to organize my dies (alphabet dies, word dies, and flower/leaf dies) in a way that would be easier to look through to choose. I put the magnetic sheets into a plastic sleeve in a 3-ring binder sorted by category. I am very pleased that the magnetic sheet is strong and the dies are all sticking to the sheets without falling off when I move the sheets. I am very pleased with the sweet note in the package from Mr. Pen and feel like I am supporting a USA business. Thank you for caring about the consumer! Will definitely buy these again!",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I've used this stuff to convert vinyl stickers into magnets.  It's very, VERY thin though, so you will need fingernails to peel the magnet off of the fridge.  Does what I bought it for, but wow is it ever thin!",3
B09BBHBZMG,Perfect to create magnets. I use this to transform cute keychains I buy during my trips into fridge magnets. I cut a small piece of the sheet and stick it to the keychain,5
B09BBHBZMG,I used two of these for the back of my refrigerator calendar this year and I am impressed with the strength. It does not budge. The size of the calendar is 11x18.,5
B09BBHBZMG,Worked perfect for our save the dates!! Fit a 4x6 perfectly.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"I like magnets because I can move them to different services, or if I need to sell the item, I can make it look new again without destroying the sticker. In my mind magnets > stickers!",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I hung a large magnetic board in my home and used these magnetic sheets for the back of my scrabble tiles.  I cut strips of these sheets, placed my wooden letters on the sticky side then easily cut the excess off of each tile.  I have about 1,000 tiles so it took me several days to do this.The magnet is not super strong but strong enough to hold my tiles in place in a  vertical position.I also have some large wooden tic tac toe x and o. I used this magnetic sheet on the back to use on the same hung magnetic board.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I ordered more magnet sheets (I ran out) for my numerous items that I make into magnets. These sheets did not disappoint and work very well. The paper is easy to remove without lifting off all of the adhesive, the magnet itself works well (it's not very strong, but I don't need strong magnets), the sheets are easy to cut, and the adhesive works very well. I had no issues with the magnet sheets, however my only complaint is that I wish they were just slightly bigger, like the size of a sheet of paper.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I bought this to make band stickers into magnets. When I ran out of stickers, I essentially went through my house looking for things that would make good magnets. I'm obsessed. It's easy to cut and the adhesive works very well.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I wanted to use them to prevent metal bookends from sliding on metal shelf. They work, but are not very strong",3
B09BBHBZMG,Thin and printable,4
B09BBHBZMG,"I used them to attach my glass 3d Printer bed to my magnetic hotbed. I can stick it to the bottom of the glass like it's a piece of vinyl and forget it ever exists. If I'm careful and clean with it I can get 2 out of one sheet, one full and another made of scraps. Everyone else uses binder clips but I can't and don't want to. These work perfectly. I don't know if they make the sheets themselves or buy them from somewhere else but I just placed my second order (because glass beds can brake from the print sticking too well to it) and I hope they don't ever change the how or who makes them.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"Let me start by saying I'm a magnet collector. I have so many types, it's crazy. I'm fascinated by magnetism. I have weak magnets, strong magnets, super strong magnets, and I even have one that requires at least 6 feet of isolation. I even magnetic field demonstrations.I bought these because I wanted to keep a small box with screws in it from sliding across a metal table. So I cut and adhered the magnetic paper to the bottom of the wooden box and was immediately met with disappointment.I was already expecting them to be weak because of how thin they are and what their general application will be. I'm okay with weak. They don't need to be strong for my application. However, I was not expecting them to be THAT weak. They're so weak, that the magnetism barely sticks to itself. I recommend you find something with more magnetic strength. Even if you were just trying to attach it to the back of a piece of paper to hang on your refrigerator, the magnetism is so weak that wind blowing across it when you open and close the fridge might remove it from the refrigerator.This is, by far, the weakest magnetic consumer product I have ever purchased. I don't want to send it back because it's the weakest magnetic strength and that's still fascinating to me, plus I've already cut and used it. Maybe I'll find a use for it. But for most, they will be sincerely disappointed.",2
B09BBHBZMG,Could be stickier,3
B09BBHBZMG,"I purchased to make ""Save the Date"" mailers for my niece. I found the adhesive perfect to adhere the printed paper mailers. The magnetic adhesion to my fridge (I had to test it !-) was great. These were easy to use, easy to cut, great for so many craft projects. Luckily, I got extra. Now I am thinking of other ways to use it.",5
B09BBHBZMG,We used these to transfer stickers we wanted to put on our garage fridge so we didn't lose them. Really good product and has an adhesive side so it makes attaching things really easy. Good buy,5
B09BBHBZMG,"I needed new magnetic stickers for my disease posters and I found these. I highly suggest them because their magnetic power is really good as well as the adhesion of the sticker. They worked really well for my displaced, only thing is, if you have a larger displays size, you will most likely need to use three magnets instead of two. (The picture I attached shows how I put ur my displays using three magnets). 10/10 product for a good price, as well as very fast shipping. 100% recommend if looking for a displate magnet.",5
B09BBHBZMG,These are easy to cut to any size you want and have a strong adhesive backing. They can be used for many things. I like to use them to make photos into magnets. I  also use them to make magnetic cases for my knitting and crafting. I add them to candy or cigar tins so my metal stitch markers and needles don't fall out.,5
B09BBHBZMG,I use to make photo magnets for my fridge. Works great.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"I got these to make joke bumper stickers for friends' cars that could easily be removed. The adhesive is strong enough that I returned the can of spray glue I didn't need to stick the stickers to the magnets. Good fun, good product and plenty for the price. No One Is Safe From my Joke Bumper Stickers Now!",5
B09BBHBZMG,Good deal for magnet making. Easy to work with and are strong.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"These are thin, but they stick well. Great for making meme magnets.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"I bought these to replace the adhesive magnet backings for some small, lightweight photos (ordered on mixtiles). They don't have enough magnetic energy to hold. Granted they stick well, cut well and I could remove the adhesive from the wall easily (so probably good DIY fridge magnets), they just didn't do the job. I actually blame Amazon bc they were suggested In my search for replacement wall magnets.",3
B09BBHBZMG,Easy to apply stickers on and cut. Can hold up thin papers on fridge.,4
B09BBHBZMG,"We needed to create logo magnets for a tradeshow - these arrived quickly, were exactly as described, and worked perfectly! Will buy again for sure.",5
B09BBHBZMG,"This product serves pretty well as advertised. As other reviewers have mentioned, the magnetism is not especially strong/far-reaching; a mildly thick piece of paper is enough to cause the magnet to fall off. However, this really only applies when sticking to a metal surface. I used the magnets to make some stickers reusable and to turn a surface magnetic. It turns out these magnets are *highly* attracted to each other. They're still easy enough to remove when I want to, but they form an ideally strong connection to one another. As such, I can use a sheet to make any surface magnetic and a great host for my new magnetic stickers. Oh yeah, the sheets are also really easy to cut (I used standard scissors for big stuff and an exacto blade for precise outlines). The adhesive definitely isn't the strongest known to man, but it was more than sufficient for my purposes.Aside from that, these sheets function okay as ordinary fridge magnets. You won't be holding a stack of appointment cards up with them or anything like that, but they work just fine for just sticking something to the fridge.",5
B09BBHBZMG,I used these sheets to turn my stickers into refrigerator magnets. They're easy to cut/trim using a good pair of scissors and worked exactly as I hoped.,5
B09BBHBZMG,Does the job,4
B09BBHBZMG,"I ordered the magnetic sheets in preparation of a meeting. i had some left from last meeting, which turned out to be enough. Company very easy to work with & product is great. Thanks",5
B09BBHBZMG,We have purchased these to use as labels on a toolbox,5
B09BBHBZMG,This will work wonderfully for the purpose for which I bought it.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"I was in need of adhesive magnet to put up some tin art  that was 10""x14"" on my walls in my office.  I saw the Mr.Pen_ Adhesive Magnetic sheets so it seemed to be exactly what I needed. After applying one of the magnets if found the adhesive part to be great however the Magnetic are very week and could not hold the art on the wall.  The plates are fairly light so I didn't think it be and issue but it turned out I was wrong.  I placed 3 of the 4x6 sheets onto the back (6 sheets in all) and at first it held but I came back 10 later and found the art on the floor.  Im sorry to say the magnets are just not strong enough. If you are looking to buy these  for hanging metal art I strongly suggest DO NOT PURCHASE THESE you'll be waisting your money.",2
B09BBHBZMG,used to make stickers into fridge magnets.,5
B09BBHBZMG,Used it to put a calendar on my metal garage door. Worked great and very strong,5
B09BBHBZMG,Purchased to add as a magnetic backing to 3D prints I make. Did the job well. Uniform thickness with good adhesive. Would buy again.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"These magnets are great for hanging up photos. They are durable and strong. They are easy and quick to use. The only downfall is that the magnet is slightly bigger than a 4X6 photo, which requires you to trim the edges after you stick the photo on.",4
B09BBHBZMG,"Love these flexible, adhesive magnetic sheets that you can cut to any size you want with regular household scissors. I use them for hanging photographs on our garage refrigerator. I might have to invest in a kegerator so I can hang more photographs!",5
B09BBHBZMG,Good quality and priced right these magnetic sheets hit the spot for my projects.  They stay up on my fridge with no problem.The little mustache with the business card was a nice added touch.,5
B09BBHBZMG,I use it for everything,5
B09BBHBZMG,I bought this to make less permanent bumper stickers and it works great for that!,5
B09BBHBZMG,Works well,5
B09BBHBZMG,I used these for keeping metal dies for card making together in storage.  Perfect size!,5
B09BBHBZMG,I used these sheets to place stickers on and then cut them out for fridge magnets! They are strong magnet material (will hold up drawings your kids make for you). Lightweight but still high quality! I will be ordering these again.,5
B09BBHBZMG,"Very disappointing with these magnets. Only strong enough to hold a sticky note size paper. Some part of the sheet was even weaker than other part of the sheet. I seesome other review gave 4 or 5 stars so im having hard time understanding what happened to mine. Bad batch maybe? Either way, I will be looking else where for stronger magnets but you risk it if you would like.Update: Increased rating for great customer service. They took this experience very seriously so they rectified  the situation with me. I would give their communication and customer service experience a 5 star rating. However, I'm sorry but this is a over all (including the product quality) experience review so the conclusion is 3 star.",3
B09BBHBZMG,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I wanted to turn an eyeshadow palette I had into a magnetic one, bought these for the project since they appeared to be what I needed and they were! They are exactly as advertised, heavy duty material, not heavy in weight (but can tell quality is there), comes in a pack of four, and they're about the size of a sheet of paper. I also didn't mind that these were a bit pricier than some others I was looking at because I'd rather pay a bit extra than have to return the cheaper option just to wait for the ones I should've gotten to begin with.These were bigger than the eyeshadow palette I had (which was totally fine), but all I had to do was cut it with an exacto knife and it cut without any troubles! Adhesive backing is super strong and is holding on with no problems whatsoever! I'm extremely pleased with this product if I ever needed more of these magnetic sheets, I will purchase these again!",5
B09BBHBZMG,"This is a very good deal if you make a lot of magnets.  Good holding power, excellent price and very easy to cut.",5
B09BBHBZMG,The amount for the price,5
B09BBHBZMG,It works fine,4
B09BBHBZMG,"I work in mental health and have struggled to find magnets that are funny but suitable for the workplace. These provide me the ability to make my own, while also giving me a super easy crafting project to do in my down time. I will absolutely buy these again if/when needed!",5
B09BBHBZMG,HAPPY!,5
B09BBHBZMG,"These worked perfectly for what I ordered them for. I accidentally ordered New Driver bumper stickers instead of magnets. They were cheap so rather than return them I ordered the magnets, cut them to size and stuck the stickers on so we could take them off and on vehicles as needed. The magnets stick well despite rain or dirt on the vehicle.",5

B001KYQP22,I got fed up with a pair of scissors I'd had for far too long that would not cut for anything and finally got around to replacing them with these. It's been a world of difference.,5
B001KYQP22,"I simply ordered a pair of scissors, but didn't expect Amazon to employ 'extra packaging' because of the potential danger of shipping such an item with merely an envelope.  So they definitely showed logical caution in shipment since they used a bigger box than necessary full of packing paper so it would make the process less dangerous to the shipping people.  Good job, Amazon.  Cudos.  Oh, and the scissors were very good and sharp, thank you.  Nice ones.",4

B001KYQP22,This pair of scissors basically is a small handy product. It in your drawer and it will not take up a lot of space. It performs pretty well. But for the size may not be for everyone.

B001KYQP22,Perfecta,5
B001KYQP22,"Terrific scissors and affordable too. Most of us have had numerous scissors around the house that typically offer mixed performance -- some are really great and others not so much. These Scotch brand scissors are a cut above (pardon the pun).The scissors are lightweight and the blades are stainless steel. The handles are ergonomic with larger than average openings -- very comfortable. The best thing is they arrive sharp and stay sharp longer than many similar designs. When resharpening is eventually needed, these Scotch scissors easily regain a fresh edge and stay sharp longer than most.My wife and I have purchased several different sizes of these Scotch scissors for sewing, artwork, general household cutting, and larger pairs for the garage. These Scotch scissors replace several similar scissor styles that just did not perform as well. At such attractive prices, these Scotch scissors will probably put a smile on your face too. Check them out for yourself.",5
B001KYQP22,I like that they are sharp and easy to hold and use.,5
B001KYQP22,"I was hoping for something a little more heavy duty, but these will be fine for normal use. I wouldn't cut anything thicker than construction paper with them, cardboard might be out of their range. The grip is comfortable, but the thumbhole isn't angled nicely enough for anything other than cutting straight in front of you.",4
B001KYQP22,Bought these scissors to replace a small pointed scissor that broke.  This scissor is very nice for cutting when needing a pointed end.,5

B001KYQP22,"Disclosure: We use these as our utility-drawer kitchen scissors in our house of 3, so they are subjected to fairly harsh usage. Namely, almost daily usage cutting packaging, paper, string, cardboard, various vegetables and food prep, and other stuff.  Nothing I would consider unexpected for what the title of ""everyday use"" suggests.My personal experience is that these are excellent scissors for about 6-8 months.  They seem to warp in the middle and eventually don't really cut, even though the blades are still ostensibly sharp.For the price I will just replace them on a regular basis, but I really would like to find a pair that is like this except with more durability.",4
B001KYQP22,Sharp.  Good size.  Not big and bulky.  I use it to cut off my cats hairballs.,5

Some other things they cut are yogurt tubes and tape.",5

B001KYQP22,"Not a lot to say. They are scissors, they are sharp and they work well. For some reason, I keep misplacing my ""good"" scissors, and can only ever find my ancient Fiskars. So, I bought this pair as a backup to hold me until my disappearing scissors reappear.They work well, and it's nice to have decent scissors that cut rather than saw/chew their way through paper.",5

B001KYQP22,"This version of Scotch's Precision Scissor that is 8-inches in length takes an old staple (no pun intended) and makes it a showpiece to include in one's home or office.  The Precision Scissor is made with a modern polymer handle that has stainless steel blade scissors The handle is incredibly ergonomic and very comfortable to use.  Compared to the many previous scissors I have owned, it really no comparison.  The price is definitely affordable (the shipping is the one to be concerned of) and what makes it distinct is the construction that is one I would expect from a new European brand like Dyson.  The blades are cut with attention to detail from the inside of the plastic handles that extend to the finger hole areas. I definitely can see me not having to purchase another pair for a very long time.  The polymer used to make the handles and lower portion of the device are high quality and reduces the discomfort of long period use that I have had with other instruments, especially when cutting thicker or heavier items.  The colors are very cool and could blend in with many office or home areas.  I couldn't have come up with better hues myself and the stripe and middle circles are modern, but can be seen as timeless.  The gray hue that is utilized is one that complements the red used in their areas.  The sound that is emitted when cutting is appealing and the size is just right for my kitchen, desk and diy work area.  I highly recommend the purchase of the Scotch Precision (8-inch) Scissor for anyone in the market for a great cutting device.",5
B001KYQP22,Great scissors.,5
B001KYQP22,They are small but very sharp. I like them.,5
B001KYQP22,"I have found that decisions are much easier now that I have these very sharp and very tough scissors.They cut paper of course, as one would only expect, and they do it smoothly and easily.  But, and here is their great side, they resist the efforts of rock to crush them.  This means I can succeed in any trial, whether my opponent throws rock and cannot destroy my scissors or paper and gets it neatly sliced in half.  If they throw scissors of their own we just keep throwing until they choose paper eventually and I win.Now, I'm sure you're saying, there are two problems with this:1) Someone will just need to get a bigger rock.  Well, I've thought that through and I have determined that a rock large enough to seriously damage these scissors would be much to heavy and unwieldy for most people.  So I need only avoid contests with particularly strong people or people with access to earth moving equipment.2) Someone will figure out my ploy and get a pair of their own super scissors, then I will be met with stalemate.  This problem is one that really does give me pause.  I cannot deny that given enough time, someone may indeed come to that conclusion.  Fortunately, most of the people I deal with on a regular basis are rather stupid, after all they allow me to beat them at this stupid game simply because I threaten to stab them with a pair of scissors.  So, I think I will have come up with another trick up my sleeve long before any of my microcephalic competitors reach that point.I think that should set the record straight.",5
B001KYQP22,They are scissors.,4
B001KYQP22,Light weight and easy to use. I like them more than my old scissors which broke in half.,5
B001KYQP22,"I needed a pair of scissors longer than the 5"" pair that I have.  We have a pair of small Scotch scissors that are of excellent quality.  When I saw that a similar pair (with red/gray handles) was available from Scotch, I didn't hesitate.  Not only are they a great value for the reasonable price, they are simply a well-made pair of scissors for papercrafting and all around household use.",5
B001KYQP22,These are well made and a great buy for the money. Highly recommend.,4
B001KYQP22,They're scissors. They cut well. Good size. What more can I say?,5
B001KYQP22,"I'm a southpaw, and I find these easy to hold and works well in cutting smoothly.",5

B000VRTG8Y,"Decided I wanted to customize and design some mugs for our Renaissance outfits. I ordered this on a whim and it works great. It's light weight and good quality, make sure you use the enclosed stand not to burn yourself or the table/floor you are working on. The different heads included are very helpful for different designs.",5
B000VRTG8Y,"Five minutes out of the package and I was burning images onto wood as practice for a wooden picture frame I planned. Although I fancy myself an artist, I've never done wood burning before.  This is fun! Great results right out of the box.  (My wooden mixing spoons in the kitchen may be in jeopardy.)Having said this, the wood burner looks innocuous enough, but is something to approach with extreme caution. It comes with a metal stand, pictured here. But even the stand will get hot. The package recommends using a pair of pliers for changing out the various tips, and I couldn't agree more. The tool heats up quickly and seems to cool down quickly as well. And it has a snap button for turning it on and off so that you don't have to unplug it all the time. But I'm going to keep the pliers next to it as a habit. I'm also using a remnant of granite to stand the tool and the metal holder on. I'll probably plan a bigger project for this new gadget. Good price. Good deal.",5
B000VRTG8Y,It's a nice tool. Only downfall is you can't adjust the temps on this one.,4
B000VRTG8Y,It was easy to use.,5
B000VRTG8Y,I have been creating gifts and this was the perfect tool for my projects.  I loved the multiple heads. A little learning curve with the grip but it is weightless and a great size. Terrific gift if you have anyone learning to wood engrave.,5
B000VRTG8Y,"I bought this wood burner in 2014, so it's had over 2 years of use. It's a great learning tool for beginners, very easy to use, no frills, no special knowledge or maintenance required. I made some really cool things with it. However, it's not manufactured to last you a lifetime. Only one tip still stays in my pen - the other 19 that I have won't screw in at all, and I never even used most of them. The tip that does stay in gets looser and more wobbly the longer the pen is on, which makes it difficult to use. The handle has no protection against heat and gets very hot while the pen is on, and this doesn't come with any sort of padded coverage, so you'll have to find your own way of keeping your hand from being burned while you use it. There's no temperature controls, and no indicator to let you know when the tool is on or off. Also, the barrel is kind of long, which is awkward at times, especially if you're burning something small or need to be precise.If you're not sure woodburning will be your thing, or you don't expect to woodburn very often, this tool is probably sufficient for occasional or temporary use.If you're really into woodburning, looking for a great tool, long-lasting, versatile, comfortable to use, for more professional looking results, add the word ""professional"" to your search and prepare to pay $150 or more. It'll be worth it.",3
B000VRTG8Y,was perfect for what I needed it for. great price and quick shipping,5
B000VRTG8Y,I found it to burn inconsistently so it wont work for what I needed. But it is perfect for someone looking to start wood burning small projects.,4
B000VRTG8Y,"The burner itself works great, but there is no case, and the smaller parts (especially the four tiny tips) are likely to get lost.",4
B000VRTG8Y,Works well.,4
B000VRTG8Y,"It worked for my purposes but it wasn't easy to use. It's not a user-friendly design. Once it heats up, even the plastic handle gets very hot so I had to use it in short sessions. What might have taken me an hour to complete took several days of on-and-off use.  I let it heat up for 5-10 minutes, burned a letter or two, then turned it off and allowed it to cool down for a good half-hour before turning on again.Be sure to practice on a piece of wood with the same hardness and density as the item you want to burn. I first printed the design on a plain piece of paper which I taped to the wood to secure it. Then I used a pen pressing hard to trace my design onto the board. I went over the etching with a Dremmel tool (very carefully, not too deep) and used a burnishing tool to rub it in to smooth it out. I did that to make it easier for the burner to follow.The ridges of the grain are tricky. Don't try to rush. If you take your time and go slowly, it works well. I would not purchase this brand again, or any cheap tool for that matter. If I ever decide to do another wood-burning project (and I probably will because I was mostly happy with the result) I will get a more professional one that is easier to maneuver, especially over those ridges. A better tool probably wouldn't be so hot to handle either. This thing could be dangerous so use caution!",4
B000VRTG8Y,Bought it for using on a personal sign for the house.,4
B000VRTG8Y,The product did come opened already. All pieces in tact and it works fine so no big issues so far.,4
B000VRTG8Y,"Nice little starting piece! This is my first time doing wood burning and I like it so far, need more practice with it and need to buy some gloves because it gets super hot while working.  AstralWorks.org",4
B000VRTG8Y,Super easy making wood medallions for our Loved Pets Christmas Tree. Neighborly fun,5
B000VRTG8Y,Easy to use. Great size. Very comfortable,5
B000VRTG8Y,Having fun with my grandkids,5
B000VRTG8Y,I bought this for my adult daughter who is into every kind of craft! She loves this wood burning kit and I bought her a bunch of accessories and extra tips for added design features. Thank you!!!,5
B000VRTG8Y,Loved this wood burning pen but found over time the tips would fall out while burning. Had to cool it down and start again. Not sure how long it will last!,4
B000VRTG8Y,"Hi! I found this handy little tool to be rather wonderful :) The other reviews are true regarding it getting hot over time and that the cord can sometimes get in the way, but the latter is merely a position adjustment where laying it out on the table next to the project worked best for me. It is a woodBURNing tool, so you can expect it to get hot after the passage of some time. With the unit I have I found that it occurred a couple of hours into the project but that it seemed to correlate well with my taking a little break and looking over the progress of my work, so it didn't hamper me at all. But if that's when you find that you really are getting rolling with the project they sell rubber cots precisely for this reason that you might want to consider purchasing.Another point to consider is the smell. Some people may find the smell in their rooms/homes of burnt wood to be annoying, so work in a well-ventilated space (maybe using a fan?) or out-of-the way area (also great for concentrating).For the novice, I would suggest starting with bits of wood, even backyard scrap, to give you a chance to warm up (no pun intended :) ) and get the feel for how you handle the tool (its warmth, the different tips, the cord placement, the effects differing pressures exert) and the large or detailed marks you can create. That will give you more confidence and a better feel for how you handle each project. Then before you start on a project, get a feel for the wood grain of the project itself by working alittle on the back of the piece. Different types of wood burn differently.This is a wonderful craft, when you consider the enormous possiblities. Another thing to consider is that you don't have to stop with just the woodburning. This may sound strange, but I use professional grade colored pencils to add dimension to the piece (i.e. the woodburning adds permanence, color and tactile quality while the pencils add vibrancy to specific areas or the entire piece depending on what you want to achieve) then I spray the project with several coats of lacquer. Remember, it's YOUR creativity and YOUR unique style that you are bringing to an otherwise plain piece of wood giving it a whole new purpose. Experiment and allow YOUR inner artist to dictate - work on garage sale furniture, storage boxes, maybe add watercolors, or glue different pieces of material/fabrics/gems to parts of the project - whatever strikes your fancy. Woodburning is a true craft requiring both dedication and whimsy but unlike most crafts the pieces you create last a long time.Hope my review helped - hope it wasn't too long :)...",5
B000VRTG8Y,I like that is has different tips for different pieces of art. You could tell that it is a beginner tool because the heat does not stay consistent. It does the trick however and I was able to make decent wood burning.,4
B000VRTG8Y,It's got a few other tools that you can attach to it and it works great but don't let it near your skin because it will burn. Be careful and give it time. It's got a good grip and it would make a great gift for somebody and it's very lightweight.I would highly recommend for any kind of a wood cutter as a beginner.,4
B000VRTG8Y,Excelente,5
B000VRTG8Y,works great for small projects,5
B000VRTG8Y,"Great for crafting, use for cutting mesh.",5
B000VRTG8Y,This is an excellent tool for someone learning to do wood burning. Easy to use and to change out tips. I ordered the alphabet set separately.,5
B000VRTG8Y,Works good and good price,5
B000VRTG8Y,"In reference to the features asked about above:  only 1 star for temperature control because there is none.  It is either hot or not, on or off, no control other than flipping the on/off switch or using the plug. For beginers = 3 stars...I'm a beginner and I was able to use it until it broke.  It is not a complicated tool.  Easy to use=yes, just be careful because it gets pretty hot pretty quickly, and it helps to have pliers to change the tips.  Overall rating = 2 stars because it broke after using for about an hour of use.  One of the tips broke off down in the tool and then I couldn't srew in any tips at all.  Cautionary tale is that you need to be very careful when changing the tips and maybe should let them cool down before trying to change them??  But if that is the case, then it is frustrating because if you want to change to a different tool in the middle of a project, then you have to stop and wait for cool down.  I didn't see anything in the literature that said this is the case.  I don't know if it is just this tool or if it is the case with all wood burning tools...so buyer beware!! And this particular tool from this vendor is NOT returnable, a fact which I missed in my shopping.  It is fairly cheap and maybe the adage that you get what you pay for is true.  But I didn't think that I needed to spend big bucks for the project I was doing.  Guess I was wrong...I will try again but this time with a different brand and a little more money, (still not big bucks, returnable this time) hoping that the materials will be a little stronger and last longer.",2
B000VRTG8Y,Great set for beginners interested in learning more about wood carving!,5
B000VRTG8Y,"Worked on my custom hat projects, no complaints.",5
B000VRTG8Y,"If you're not sure whether you'd like pyrography or not this is a great starter tool. It's cheap, comes with three basic tips that can do a lot of different lines and shadings, and it's not too hot on the main hand. I didn't ever need a heat resistant glove.Keep in mind because it is a cheap tool it has no temperature control of any kind. There is only an ON/OFF switch. The heat is also inconsistent while working. It will get really hot and work great for a few minutes, but then cool off and become slow to work with/won't burn well. You CAN use it to do really detailed work, just be aware that it can get frustrating when you can't count on a consistent burn.For basic stuff and just trying out the hobby it's ideal. For advanced stuff or big projects, not so much.",4
B000VRTG8Y,"For me it gets the job done, but note if you want to continuously get clean lines with no skipping you will need a heavy duty one that costs more. This one works if you factor in heat loss and letting it reheat in between burns to ensure a smooth line.",3
B000VRTG8Y,Easy to work with and liked it a lot but it only lasted about a month. Stopped working.,2
B000VRTG8Y,This is an okay product not commercial grade but fun for projects,4
B000VRTG8Y,Great,5
B000VRTG8Y,Product is easy to use and works well.,4
B000VRTG8Y,I enjoy my first experience. I may have picked something over my head to try first. But I am very pleased with how easily I could burn in my pattern into the wood. It helps to have the work piece secured firmly. Also a stable base to lean your arm against. This help stabilize your hand and get a cleaner important on your surface. It's easy to slip and burn out side your image. Have patience when you first start up your iron. I let it heat up for 15 to 20 minutes. Without the warm up time you get an uneven burn. Parts will show up lighter in the wood. Just go over then again  when tips hot to fix. Better yet wait.The kit comes with different types of burning tips. This increases the possibilities of your creations.,4
B000VRTG8Y,Using to cut mesh for wreaths to limit that amount of unraveling.  Works great - BUT there is a very strong chemical smell.,5
B000VRTG8Y,"Great tool for beginners as described. Will take some practice runs to learn how to hold it, work around the cord and to learn what each tip will do. It does not take much pressure to get the burn into the wood. For the most part easy use with a little practice. The power cord is a little over 4 foot long so you have enough length to work with.It gets really hot and reaches temp within two minutes. It comes with four tips total. Be sure to read instructions on changing tips. It also comes with a stand to place the burner on while in use. Instructions says to tape the stand down to prevent it from sliding or even falling over. It is a good idea to do this. The stand could be made better with rubber grips on it to hold it in place or even a small stand built directly onto the burner similar to a glue gun. I did find that depending on the angle you place the stand and to be sure its on a surface that it will not slide works good, for i do not always have tape on hand. The tips allow you to burn small things into the wood (pic below) if you are doing small projects. This burner is priced right and I am glad we ordered this....NEW FOUND HOBBY.",5
B000VRTG8Y,This is fantastic very good price and it works great only wish they were more bits in it to do more stuff overall I love it,5
B000VRTG8Y,"This is a good quality product. I recommend doing some research into various products if you are going to be doing excessive wood burning, however, this works great!",5
B000VRTG8Y,"I made a sign with this wood burner, and it was my first wood burning project. It heated up fairly quickly and the tips worked well. It was easy to use, even for a beginner. But it got hot to the touch fairly quickly and I had to stop it and let it cool down and start it back up again several times before I could finish my project. It was a little hard to unscrew the tips and feels like it won't be a long-lasting tool, but I'd recommend it for beginners trying to do smaller projects and people wanting to try wood burning without investing a lot of money.",4
B000VRTG8Y,Perfect for what I needed,5
B000VRTG8Y,Nice long cord. Easy on off . Good item for the price,4
B000VRTG8Y,Bueno,4
B000VRTG8Y,"This Woodburner Pen feels a bit ""light duty"" to me, but it does get the job done.  And maybe it will work for a long time, I'll probably never know about that because my woodburning requirements are few.But I would suggest that you be careful and not drop this on the floor or other hard surfaces.  I've pulled mine onto the floor twice from the weight of the electric cord pulling on the woodburner.  The cord is heavier than the woodburner.  I half-expected it to be broken ... but ... so far, so good.I like the small ""stand"" that comes with this woodburner ... it makes for a convenient place to lay the woodburner down in between ""burns"" so that you don't burn the table that you're working on.  And I like the ""on / off"" switch better than plugging and unplugging the woodburner, like my last woodburner.And, as other reviewers have mentioned, this woodburner does get hot ... which ... yes ... IS what it's supposed to do.  You'll want to be vigilant using this piece of equipment, supervise kids closely if you let them use this, and be careful that the cat or dog (or, like in my case, your knee!) doesn't hit the cord and pull the woodburner onto the floor.",5
B000VRTG8Y,"I ordered this product along with an X-large slab of basswood, also from Walnut Hollow.I dont know much about woodburning and haven't invested a lot of time into learning what all the attatchments are really used for. But it seems to me that they are self explanitory.I hooked it up straight out of the packaging and went to town on the basswood after stenciling my design.Couldn't be happier for my first project, which was a sign for my girlfriends horse pen. I was skeptical about how hot the pen would get and how the process worked but I can tell you it carved like butter.Just for practice, I would run to the local home improvement store and pick up a good slab of scrap hardwood. I didn't bother practicing because I had a stencil to guide me, but my technique improved as I went along and I recommend you practice and get a feel for it before puting it down on the real deal.If you are looking to get into woodburning, I recommend this pen.It was a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to ordering more wood to make more projects.4/5 stars because I'v only used the product once, but I can speak for beginners that you won't be dissapointed.",4
B000VRTG8Y,"We found this beat up toy car at a flea market. We wanted to ""present"" it to a friend. Figured a wood burned marking would be more appropriate than a bright shiny new label. The wood burning tool did it's job nicely with my 1st time amateur effort. Now we just need to get the wood looking old and beat up. Oh yeah. There is a switch for power. Duh. My handheld soldering tools never did so I was sitting there until love love pointed out my dingbat moment.",5
B000VRTG8Y,"We bought this wood burning pen for a wedding project.  We have never used a wood burning pen before, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.  I really appreciated the variety of tips that were provided, we had trouble with the ""standard"" tip, but the one that looked like a pen was perfect!  We liked it so much that we bought the letter stamps that go with it as well:  Walnut Hollow Hotstamps Alphabet Set        . I did not find that the pen got too hot to hold - we burned 45 small initials into hearts in about 30 mins and never had to let it cool down.  The only (small) negative is that the on/off switch is heavier than the pen, so it can pull the pen off the stand or off the table if you are not careful.  I solved the problem by placing a piece of wood on the cord so that the switch would not fall off the table as I used it.  No big deal, but you need to be careful, as it is HOT!  :)  I would recommend this for anyone who is a beginner at wood burning - don't be afraid!",4
B000VRTG8Y,Good for what i needed.,4
B000VRTG8Y,"Very easy to use, great quality, love that it has on/off switch and 4 different tips, heats quickly and burns well (don't push down hard or you'll scorch). Very pleased with the first use.As recommended on the package, use pliers to change the tips.",5
B000VRTG8Y,"For beginners only. Can accomplish pretty nice pyrography, but it will take a long time, and by far not hot enough as other tools. Still, compared to all the cheapest options, this pen is better than other beginners pens ( less hot on your fingers, warmer than others).",3
B000VRTG8Y,it is well worth the money,5
B000VRTG8Y,"I'm sorry but this item needs to be redesigned. First of all, the handle gets very HOT when in use. Secondly, you will feel this heat because the design is so poor that when yoo try to use it to draw, like holding a pen, it is IMPOSSIBLE to avoid the heat from it and 100% uncomfortable to try to design. It's just not possible to hold like a pen, so its not ideal if you wish to draw patterns. So good luck with trying to burn patterns as if you are drawing. I gave it 2 stars because it actually Burns well, but is just not comfortable to handle. It will now join my tool pan as decor.",2
B000VRTG8Y,"Thanks to the other Amazon reviews, I wore a heat resistant (dishwash) glove. It gets HOT!!Only change out the tips when it has cooled down and gently use pliers. Don't force the threads as they can break.The Universal tip was useless for curves;  I mainly used the Cone Point tip. I wish this came with more tips. Look up pyrography videos on how to start. There are a ton online!",4
B000VRTG8Y,This is nothing fancy but it does the job for small projects and the price is good for what you get.,5
B000VRTG8Y,It works,5
B000VRTG8Y,Bought this before Christmas with a lowercase letter set. Made four different gifts with it. All the recipients loved their gifts. Fun little tool for crafters!!,5
B000VRTG8Y,"At first, I liked that the instrument heated up so fast. On the other hand, there is no heat regulator and it gets too hot, for instance... I used it for heavy plastic and tried on wood. I think the heat is too extreme and would never allow children to use it without an adult with them. I burned myself even 2x.",4
B000VRTG8Y,I bought this to use as an engraver to be used on styrofoam boards for Halloween decorations.  Product worked better than I imagined for what I needed.  Glad I found it!,5
B000VRTG8Y,Be careful when using it for larger pieces or when needing to press a bit harder for certain woods. The handle can get a bit warm for your finger tips,4
B000VRTG8Y,"I use a woodburner for marking and trimming things in the garage.  It is useful for melting the ends of nylon cord to keep it from unravelling. The uses are unlimited. When mine finally died, I purchased this Walnut Hollow Creative Woodburner Value Pen from AMAZON for $9.15 delivered.  It is fabulous. Comes with 5 interchangeable screw-in brass tips, and a handy stand. The cord has a neat ON/OFF Switch. The handle is sturdy Green Plastic and the Heat Pen has a nice heat-protective Cone. This unit looks to last for years. The tips heat-up quickly, so you have minimal down time before you can work on a new project.I am a bike rider, and am always getting loose threads on gloves and jerseys. One trick I have learned is that the Woodburner is great for treating these threads ('Irish Pennets') - just touch the thread with woodburner and thread melts and shrivels making a great quick repair. Only works with acrylic on nylon...cotton threads will burn, but not shrink.Highly recommended!john",5
B000VRTG8Y,"Works great! Lightweight, easy to use",5
B000VRTG8Y,I am very pleased with the product but there are some IMPORTANT things to note:There are no burn settings it has an on/off switch.The handle warms up after prolonged use and may become too hot to handle safely. Take a 5 minute break.Only place the plastic handle part on the metal stand provided.Burn tip changes MUST BE DONE WITH PLIERS WHEN THE DEVICE IS UNPLUGGED AND COOL ENOUGH TO TOUCH. do not screw on with excessive force.Read the back of the box before using.Made a Viking style cup as a beginner project. Im pleased with how it turned out.,4
B000VRTG8Y,"I bought this product because I remember as a kid going to Girl Scout camp and doing wood burning as one of the activities. I opened it the moment that it arrived on my doorstep today and got straight into it. It comes with 3 extra tips for each kind of burning you need to do. Of course, they are all the basic tips, but what more could a beginner need? The pen is very sensitive on the touch of wood and burns beautifully. The tip heats up very quickly, so be very careful once you turn it on. Also the top part of the handle starts to get hot after a bit of use, so make sure to hold it lightly and a little closer towards the middle than you are used to with a normal pencil. Perfect product and can't wait to continue and enhance my wood burning skills.",4
B000VRTG8Y,"I bought this product to do some craft wood-burning. It did not get as hot as I would have liked to get the detail I wanted, but for the price I can't complain about functionality too much. If you are looking for intricate detail with consistent lines (small letter tracing ect), I wouldn't recommend. If you want to do larger area burning it will work fine. Also, wait until the tip cools prior to exchanging the tip. I tried using plyers to unscrew the tip while it was still hot and the tip broke off, leaving the threads still inserted. I fault my own impatience for this, but just be careful that you do not make the same mistake.",4
B000VRTG8Y,Easy tool and worked great with all my mesh.  The wire is a little stiff so can get awkward to work.  But it seems to be getting better.  The stand is also helpful since the tool gets hot you don't want to leave it on your work surface as it will burn.,5
B000VRTG8Y,I had one before but lost it so I bought this one because it was not too expensive.  It came and I was so impressed it was pretty much like my old one.  The tips are easy to switch out and easy to use.  I have burned multiple wood things and it works great on everyone.,5
B000VRTG8Y,"The pen is easy to hold, and clip holds it off surfaces when not in use. The tips were rather large for what I wanted, and cursive on small objects was impossible!",4
B000VRTG8Y,Cheap Chinese junk.,3
B000VRTG8Y,I am a beginner for this item. It has worked well for the few things I have tried so far. Probably a good starting item before investing in something expensive.,4
B000VRTG8Y,"I bought this to cut and seal ribbon with. It works very well for that, The stand is flimsy and easy to knock over but as long as you expect that, you can work around it. All in all this was a good purchase. It saved me a lot of time as I had 175 pieces of ribbon to cut and seal for a large group project. I used a rimmed cookie sheet, turned upside down on my kitchen table to do the cutting on. I measured and used a Sharpie to make a small mark on the bottom of the cookie sheet so I would know where to cut the ribbon. It worked well. I am excited to be able to try wood burning at some point too.",4
B000VRTG8Y,"This product worked super well for my purposes, but if your hands are prone to cramping you'll need to take breaks.",4
B000VRTG8Y,"I've never used a woodburner before, but this one heats up in just a few minutes, the bits are easy to switch out, and it has a resting stand for when you want to set it down without burning your shop benches. Maybe that's all standard. Anyways, I did notice that the plastic cone near the end (the one designed for your fingers, and to keep them away from the heat) does get a little warmer than I'd prefer. I don't think it could ever burn you unless you touched the actual metal, and its job is literally to be a barrier between those temperatures and your hand, but I would have preferred it staying the same room-temperature that the rest of the plastic stays. Even if you only were to use this a few times, for the price, I'd recommend it my friends.",4
B000VRTG8Y,"I got this because i am a beginner. It's easy to use, you just turn it on and after a minute it is hot.Simple right!?Well the only issues i had with this was the tip and handle. After using it for more than an hour or so the tip began to screw its self off and the handle began to get hot too. I guess it's from the prolonged heat. Don't know if this is normal or not but it did seem like something that should be fixed.Other than that",4
B000VRTG8Y,"Hey guys!I needed a wood burning tool for a large project (donut wall), and I picked this one up.In the world of wood burning, you really can get entry level of high-level tools. This is decidedly entry level. Overall, it has what you need to get started, and it works. Unfortunately, a few of the tips got hot/bent when I was using thim, which ultimately caused the pen to stop working (bit broke off in shaft, making the whole thing worthless. But, it worked for a good 40 hours before the mess up!",4
B000VRTG8Y,"Heats up quickly, comes with four different heads and a wire stand. Works great and I recommend it.",5
B000VRTG8Y,Got this to use on straw hats. I was skeptical it would work but the find tip really helps clean up the letters in the alphabet set. Would work great at free handing a flat surface.,5
B000VRTG8Y,I do not use this for wood burning. I only use it for melting holes in plastic containers to use as plant pots. I've done wood burning in the past as a professional artist. This is only a beginner tool for that.,5
B000VRTG8Y,"It was my first Woodburning pen, and I'm glad it was. Let's start off with the cons. You have to be very consistent with your stroke or it will quickly bleed into a black dot, like a very inky pen. Sometimes I feel like the heat is too weak to make a deep, dark line consistently. These aren't very outstanding flaws in the pen.For the pros, well it's a great all rounder. I used it with plenty of different woods and learned which are easier to burn through. It let me make some cool designs on a leather flask I've been wanting to do for a while. The tip variety it comes with is super useful, and I absolutely love the soldering tip, especially when tinkering with my computer.This pen is great for it's price, I highly recommend it to people starting off with woodburning.",5
B000VRTG8Y,Great little tool but won't stay in stand provided. Even in the instructions it tells you to tape it down. There should be a better solution.,4
B000VRTG8Y,Easy to use,5

B0018N7J8E,"I'm a crafter. I use Mod Podge. I use Mod Podge a lot! This stuff is perfect for decoupage and for gluing paper projects together. I've used Mod Podge to adhere paper to wood, paper to paper, napkins to paper and napkins to candles. Perfection every time. Be sure to get the Mod Podge brush to spread this glue with- you will not be disappointed at how well, how easily it spreads as a thin layer on to your project. And if you feel the need to be a kid again, yes this will peel off your hands if you desire to coat them in Mod Podge and wait for it to dry.",5

B0018N7J8E,My jute rope decor plates have been drying for 3 days and still not tried clear is there a way to fix this does modge podge have a beige or tan color glue to maybe fix it,3
B0018N7J8E,"Got a tip on how to use this to finish a 5D art piece and I have used it ever since. Mod Podge Glue Sealant is great for 5D art as you can paint it on to an area if the stickiness is fading from the art when applying the diamond dots. Then this is an amazing sealant. I use a wide flat brush and maybe a slight bit of water as this is a water based product and I ""paint"" my finished art with Mod Podge and none of the beads/diamonds will fall off a finished piece and this version, the Gloss finish, creates a nice polished look for the art to be hung up. I also have pets and am very impressed at how Mod Podge dries and it does NOT pick up additional pet hair once dried. Where was this stuff for all of my first diamond art pieces?!!! I use it to finish ALL of my 5D/Diamond Art I want to be Glossy and for Display!!! The diamonds stay on amazingly well!!! Will purchase again when I run out. A MUST for anyone doing 5D/Diamond Art!!!",5
B0018N7J8E,Works great,5
B0018N7J8E,"I am obsessed with making cone trees... Mod Podge is in my crafting arsenal to attach wrapping paper, scrap book paper, even glitter and I seal them with it as well. The garland trees are done with another product.",5
B0018N7J8E,I love Mod Podge but it seriously came with only the foil seal - no lid.  How am I supposed to close the container??,3
B0018N7J8E,Great for sealing,5
B0018N7J8E,"This was the first time I used Modpoge.  It spread very easy, but boy it produced a lot of bubbles.  I was using it to make waves on a resin model.  It was a little too runny to make tall waves, but it did make nice ripples.  Where the bubbles formed did emphasize the ripples, which did help, but I would have preferred no bubbles.  I'm assuming I just need more experience working with it.",4
B0018N7J8E,Mod Podge is the O.G. of glue and sealants.  Accept no substitutes.,5
B0018N7J8E,"Seals, glues, and shines!  I use modge podge for all my craft needs.  The thicker your sealing layers are the longer the dry time.  Once drying is completed,  perfecto! I close this jar tightly and it has not dried out.  I have had this jar for 6 months now.",5
B0018N7J8E,I guess it works ok.  I wasn't paying attention and it was bigger size than I needed.,3
B0018N7J8E,The only problem I ran across was the thickness. But that was easily resolved by adding a touch of water to thin it out for a smoother coat. Shows a beautiful luster to your projects and I highly recommend it for arts and crafts.,5
B0018N7J8E,"Just skimming the top it seemed ok, but when I poured some into a cup it was apparent that it had already congealed in the center. Just purchased.",2
B0018N7J8E,Mod Podge is the best glue hands down for puzzles. Glossy or matte finish always leave my puzzles looking amazing!,5
B0018N7J8E,Exactly what I needed.,5
B0018N7J8E,"I found this 32 ounce jar of Mod Podge water-based sealer for the same price as an 8 ounce jar!  So I bought 2! It is no different from the smaller one for the same price, as far a quality. Same consistency, it doesn't seem to be expired or have any issues, it was just one heck of a great price.  If you are a crafter and use this stuff, get the 32 ounce jar!",5
B0018N7J8E,I should have got dishwasher safe but it works,5
B0018N7J8E,I use this mod podge to seal the glitter on this wooden club. It did an amazing job!,5
B0018N7J8E,"This is the first time I used the gloss version. It was on sale, so I  figured I'd give it a try. I applied over metallic rub-ons which were highlighting  stamped paper clay. The smell is atrocious. The gloss is subtle which was perfect for my need. My daughter used it to seal her diamond art picture. She is very pleased with the result as it let the sparkle of the ""diamonds"" remain.",5
B0018N7J8E,I used it to adhere this gold fleck lace to a plastic cabinet and it worked beautifully! Dried completely clear also! I've never had an issue with modpodge .,5
B0018N7J8E,Great for puzzles,5
B0018N7J8E,I got this giant bottle of hodgepodge on sale. I wanted it to make string lanterns.  I've used it to seal other outdoor projects. Its not the best for sealing but it has many uses and with this big bottle you can try many of them.,5
B0018N7J8E,When I received the product the seal was broken and glue was all over. Good for the project I needed for but would have liked to not have to clean it before I used it,3
B0018N7J8E,So glad I found this great buy. I use it a lot in my crafts,5
B0018N7J8E,"Love this product, great for crafts for adults and kids ( with parental supervision). The cost and delivery time was perfect",5
B0018N7J8E,"We've been using Mod Podge in my family since my mother was a child. It's durable, looks great, and spreads easily. This is an enormous jar. I don't think I'll ever run out.",5
B0018N7J8E,This is a great size and works great on puzzles,5
B0018N7J8E,Just what I wanted.,5
B0018N7J8E,"I purchase this for a friend of mine who glues all his jigsaw puzzles together. The puzzle glue was getting to be too expensive, so I ordered this for him to try. He likes mod podge much better. And it is a lot less expensive than the puzzle glue.",5
B0018N7J8E,clear,5
B0018N7J8E,"I bought a combo pack of 32 oz jar Mod Podge with the Mod Podge Paint Brush Applicator, 24960 2.25-Inch (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHQ7IBO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) . I am a recent Diamond Painting addict thanks to social isolation and decided to seal my finished pieces.  All I had at home was the Mod Podge intended for Puzzle sealing, which I used for an expensive, but low quality DP kit (became required to seal in order to keep the drills in place). After searching for a better application I came across this brush and the GLOSS Mod Podge and am very glad I did!  The brush made applying fast, east and nearly flawless. The gloss Mod Podge didn't detract from my finished product at all!  (Picture attached)",5
B0018N7J8E,As described,5
B0018N7J8E,This stuff is amazing for all types of crafts. I used it here.to make ornaments for Christmas.It arrived in a timely manner and was a great value for the money.,5
B0018N7J8E,Works wonders for a sealer! For diamond paintings!,5
B0018N7J8E,Dries great excellent product for crafting,5
B0018N7J8E,Purchased this twin pack and the price is sooo much better than some retailers.,5
B0018N7J8E,"So I didn't expect it to come in a cardboard jar, but that's okay because it's not leaking at all. I haven't even used half of it and do a LOT of crafts. Mod podge is my go to and when I saw this I immediately bought it because it's this price for those small bottles at my local Walmart.",5
B0018N7J8E,"So, I'm very glad my Mod Podge didn't leak in shipping.  Awesome.  Now, if only your leak proof sticker didn't cover the entire direction set.  Also, two inches to the left is a completely blank area of the bottle.  Idiotic.",4
B0018N7J8E,Love it for my DIYs,4
B0018N7J8E,"It spreads great like all mod podge does, dries clear and dries fairly fast.  I specifially got glossy for diamond paintings as I have matte for puzzles...  Now are my lil drills glued down better yes. I had to restick a few as the modpodge dried as just brushing over knocked some loose even after rolling them down. So you certainly need a top sealer like mod podge for that kind of project.  What has me a little bummed is this gloss is more matte and really dulled down the 110 hrs of diamond painting work.  The sideways picture is after application of modpodge.",4
B0018N7J8E,I use this stuff for so many different projects. Such a great deal to buy this larger bottle and it lasts a while. Will definitely be buying again.,5
B0018N7J8E,"I actually just used this for the first time today and I really like it. I've never used mod podge before and I got this for sealing puzzles. It dried fairly quickly and I didn't really notice any brush marks. I did notice a few minor chunky spots that didn't dry clear, but that's totally my fault for putting a bit too much. The one thing I do hate is the awful smell? I didn't read many reviews, so I'm unsure if this happened to anyone else. I would recommend opening some windows if you use this just to help it air out. Overall I really like this product so far!",5
B0018N7J8E,Same price as driving to store...nearest to me is 22 miles one way...so this was great!,5
B0018N7J8E,Mod Podge is a good product.  But if you do a lot of project like I do it does get expensive.  Since then I have learned how to make my own mod podge.  Home made mod podge functions just like the original mod podge. If you don't make a lot of art projects it will work for you.  But I am going to continue to using the mod podge I make at home.,4
B0018N7J8E,Leaves a good shiny coating,5
B0018N7J8E,"I put together a 9,000 piece puzzle and wanted to put it on the wall.  Because it is such a large puzzle, I wasn't sure if the glue would hold it together well enough to actually be able to even pick it up.  But it did!  I put two layers of glue on the front and it worked great!  It is a little scary at first because the glue comes out of the container white.  But it really does dry to a nice clear finish.  I totally recommend it for any puzzles!",5
B0018N7J8E,Plaid perfected the podge after peccadillo. It had signs of old leakage. Contacted manufacturer who rapidly sent replacement. Excellent item. Excellent product support.,5
B0018N7J8E,"This stuff works so great in so many craft crazy ways!  1 is - I like to decorate wood pieces with vinyl cutouts, all I have to do is paint some mod podge on it, let it dry and they are ready for interior decorations.  I also like to find a hard-backed book and lay it open in the middle and smother it with mod podge, then I get a wedding invitation and... never mind, you should just get some and this vendor got it out to me right on time.",5
B0018N7J8E,"I love mod podge and use it for all my projects. However, this shipper needs to pack and seal more effectively.  Mine came open and spilled all over the rest of the contents in the box.",4
B0018N7J8E,"Yes, as always this is a product I use often for arts and crafting.  This size is a great value too.  However, it was packed (by Amazon) with nothing in the box but the bottle; nothing to ""hold it in place"", i.e. packing material.  It leaked, badly.  I had a terrible time cleaning up the mess and trying to clean the jar.  The lid was glued on but since the jar is a material where the glue doesn't adhere well, I was able to peel it off mostly.  At any rate, Amazon needs to know to PACK THIS AND OTHER LIQUID PRODUCTS much better.",5
B0018N7J8E,"So I was kinda sceptical about getting this Mod Podge. Many people talked about missing caps, open bottles, terrible packing ect. This was the cheapest I could find for a 32oz so I took a chance on it. Glad I did because it came in perfect condition. It also has  ""The Gripper "" Seal on it. Not sure if its because so many people complained about packaging but it seems to work and it wasn't a pain to take off. Overall I'm very happy.",5
B0018N7J8E,The price has to be a mistake on their behalf for the size. I paid that for 1/4 of size.,5
B0018N7J8E,"It's thick and needs to be water down or it pools. It has a stronger smell than the regular Mod Podge Matte, which is my go to for priming eva foam. I used it undiluted and it didn't look so good on my finished product. I suggest thinning it down just a little bit with water and applying thin, layered coats. I bought this glossy version to recreate a shiny metal look.",4
B0018N7J8E,I love using this product and i have been a fan for a long time.  Dries really clear and easy to apply,5
B0018N7J8E,Worked great on wood,5
B0018N7J8E,The mod podge sealer was the worse mess ever.The top came off and all the sealer  was all over the inside of the soggy box left at my door. If I could give it a zero rating I would.,1
B0018N7J8E,"ya know... when i was a teen, in the 70's i used this stuff for my art projects... and over 50 years later im still using it for my arts. i totally ADORE that the label looks just like it did back then (to me) and that it still works for everything i want to do.. the stuff is amazing and lovely and sweet and GOOD at what its intended for...life is good!!",5
B0018N7J8E,I mix with paint for pouring or paint on after art is dried as a sealer.,5
B0018N7J8E,I love doing puzzles and the glue was right on time. Thanks and I will buy again,5
B0018N7J8E,i use this for lots of art projects,5
B0018N7J8E,"Mine arrived in perfect condition, with top and with the foil seal. It was delivered early then estimated time. Despite reading a few folks had issues, I had confidence in the purchase and know if there's an issue Amazon always resolves. Back to product, it is great for crafts/arts and this price can't be beat at other retailers. I can tell you the 16 oz is no lower then 10 bucks at any store.",5
B0018N7J8E,I use this to seal my Dimond paintings,5
B0018N7J8E,I love to use this product I use it for sealing my jewel art and cards and it does a wonderful job,4
B0018N7J8E,Dries quickly,5
B0018N7J8E,But ayyyyyy what a good deal.,5
B0018N7J8E,I really enjoy using this for my puzzles. It leaves your puzzles looking really good with a nice finish and its super easy to spread. Would definitely buy more of this.,5
B0018N7J8E,"I ordered two bottles, one was great the other seemed a bit ""short"" or not as full as the other like it had been used or spilled.  Other than that the product works great and came quick!",4
B0018N7J8E,"This stuff was recommended by a YouTuber for users interested in doing 3D terrain and miniatures for table top gaming. I am glad I got some of this stuff, because I love it.I use it as a finishing touch on all my 3D printed stuff. It dries clear, adds a nice gloss finish and gives everything I put it on a look like it was done with oil paint.I swear by this stuff.",5
B0018N7J8E,I love this glue for my puzzles. It is white so you can make sure you get it in all the cracks but then dries clear. It dries very fast to which i love. I only have to put 1 coat on front of the puzzle then 1 coat on the back sometimes depending on how cheap the pieces are made.,5
B0018N7J8E,This was the best price I have found on this product. It is very exspensive in retail stores. Good deal!!!,5
B0018N7J8E,"Adheres well and is easy to use.  Better price online than in the stores near me.  Once opened I would suggest using it within 6 months.  It will still work after but not as easy to spread on and get to dry even and clear.  It would just depend on what your using it for.  Have always had good experience with this product and would definitely recommend it,",5
B0018N7J8E,I used this product on a fun craft with my nephew's. It can out great. It dries clear and the glue has the perfect amount of shine to it. This sized container was much larger then I expected do to the fact that a little bit of glue going a long way.,5
B0018N7J8E,"Seals decoupage projects well. Apply a THIN layer. A thicker layer tends to leave the surface somewhat sticky. The smell isn't great, but not horrible either. Good stuff for many projects.",5
B0018N7J8E,Ive used this stuff in a variety of ways for years. Most recently i used it to create a faux waterfall prop for a photoshoot which came out really cool. I added a couple drops of blue and green liquid color to one container to slightly tint it giving it a stained glass look when dry. I applied in thin layers to a large piece of smoothe plastic and when completely dry carefully peeled away  and  in a few layers hung the pieces to mimic downward flowing water. Really cool! Just one of the many uses for this stuff.,5
B0018N7J8E,Great price for this item. Fast delivery,5
B0018N7J8E,Product broke and glue leaked all over everything inside the box as well as outside of the box. I have glue on the walkway at the front of my door as well as at the end of my driveway. To get my refund I have to return products but they are now in a trash bag. Took pictures but cannot attach and I'm not opening the bag again to get glue everywhere as I did before.,1
B0018N7J8E,"This stuff is awesome, I love it. It sticks to about anything. I paint rocks and I put it on top of the paint and it makes the colors pop. Then after it dries I put a spray gloss on top of it incase the rocks get wet. I love the stuff. It smells good too.",5
B0018N7J8E,"I love to cut out colorful pictures then use Mod Podge glue on anything. An empty Tide jug became a penny bank.A cardboard box became a colorful flowers and bird outside and inside as a storage container.I went over the outside with shiny glace' (glass) . There are several different glues and to experiment is the fun part.My next project is to use the front of Christmas cards to decorate plain cardboard boxes.  These will be used the gift giving box. Fun, fun and more projects to decorate using old calendars.",5
B0018N7J8E,"It worked great but I had a severe reaction to it. Apparently I am severely allergic to it. I had horrible chest pains and breathing issues after using it. As soon as we removed the art project, I got better.",5

B0013JR8QQ,I used it on cardstock for these chip bags and it was smooth and easy. At one point I ran out of liquid glue and had to use my glue gun. This dried fast and made it hard to use the crumpet because it was bumpy but with just a little more pressure it still crimped great!,5

B0013JR8QQ,Easy to use.,5
B0013JR8QQ,easy to use,5
B0013JR8QQ,"The picture used to represent this product is not even a picture of the actual product.  It is the resulting paper, after it has been crimped.  That nearly caused me to pass by the listing altogether.  I'm going to include a picture here of the actual paper crimper.That said, it's a terrific crimper!  It makes straight lines across your page, at whatever angle you insert the paper.  You can make patterns by running the paper through at multiple angles.  When making a scrapbook page or a card, crimped paper adds dimension.  Ideas include using it to crimp green paper to make a Christmas tree, using a piece of crimped paper as a mat for a picture, make a fall themed card/page and use crimped paper for a haystack.  The possibilities are endless.  The fact that this crimper will accept up to 8.5"" paper makes it useful for a range of sizes.I've seen many crimpers that are smaller and less expensive.  They are also more cheaply made.  This is a great value and very useful for any paper crafter.  I love mine.",5

B0924GVKW2,I use these to make polymer clay figurines. They work really well and are made well. The tools are all easy to hold and a good size.,5
B0924GVKW2,"quality lines up with the price, not too bad a good beginner set",4
B0924GVKW2,"Hosted a party with about 8-9 people, all crafting small polymer figures. This set of tools was enough to share amongst all of us, and is versatile enough to create lots of shapes/patterns.",5
B0924GVKW2,"I bought this for my daughter who is into making clay figures. She immediately went through it to see how many different types of tools there were. It was a good variety, all packaged well, and they seem sturdy. A great deal for all that you receive.",5
B0924GVKW2,"My sisters and I have both air dry and oven bake clay! These tools I was afraid wouldn't work as well with air dry clay as they have oven bake, but they are sharp, durable, and easy to use!I love the variety of tools and how many different materials they are made of!!",5
B0924GVKW2,My daughter loves it so much . She can easily carve her polymer clay and design with this kind of tools. Highly recommend,5
B0924GVKW2,"They're awesome but, I almost have a hard time getting use from them all but, they're great and good quality!",5
B0924GVKW2,I just got in to resin casting and needed to use clay. This kit offers most everything you need to get started in working with clay in making silicone molds. Recommended.,5
B0924GVKW2,Es algo en el cual se reciben todo lo indicado,5
B0924GVKW2,"i knew when i bought it that i wasn't getting professional quality tools. the price pretty much tells one that. so for what it was, it's okay.but please note that all the tools in the bundle are of pretty low quality as far as long term use is concerned. and the wooden parts & tools are Not seasoned, not protected for what would surely destroy light-weight wood. if they get wet, it Will damage them in a hurry. basically, raw barely smoothed balsam/poplar wood that's Just sanded enough not to splinter Too bad.the plastic/silicone tools, sure. they're mostly what i wanted anyway. but, yeah, i won't be using the wooden ""tools"" in the bundle.also, the sponge... not sure why that's in there. it's not sturdy enough to use for wiping down the tools and it's so dainty, i doubt it could be used more than a couple times for texturing clay before disintegrating.but for the price, eh, you get what you pay for.it gets three stars because there are plenty enough Usable piece to the pack that for the time being, it's worth it to me. but if you're looking for something long lasting, i suggest looking further along in the search results.",3
B0924GVKW2,Good product,5
B0924GVKW2,Exelentes piezas,5

B0924GVKW2,I really enjoyed this set as it has all the basics you need to get started. I have had this set for over 2 months and its good quality.,5
B0924GVKW2,"They seem nice, but I ordered the kit for my wife to use, and she hasn't said anything one way or the other.  These could be 4 or 5 star.  All I can say is that buy them and try them.",3
B0924GVKW2,"Really great for the price, came with a lot of tools, a sponge and a little bag to store it. Have yet to use them but they seem great",4
B0924GVKW2,Great set with lots of tools,5
B0924GVKW2,"My grandson ask for clay and tools.  He loves anything artistic, but I have no artistic ability.  So with little knowledge it can be difficult to know what is needed.  But this kit has a good variety: design, material, etc.I think it provides a nice base for him to build his own collection.",5

B0924GVKW2,Fast shipping and item as described!,5

B0924GVKW2,Great little set of tools. Nice quality for the most part. The wooden tools do splinter.,4
B0924GVKW2,"I make just little plant clay sculptures and things for fun and this kit has so many helpful tools!! It made shaping and smoothing so much easier. My personal favorite from this set is a tool that makes wood-like texture, I've been making tons of little trees and mushrooms with it and they look real!! Very very good price for all the items that come with it.",5
B0924GVKW2,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Nice starter kit. The tools appear to be well made.

B0924GVKW2,Are you just starting with polymer clay? Are you in need of some tools without a huge expense like in craft stores? Look no further you have found it. These are perfect they come with about everything you need even a pouch. This product definitely lives up past the price point and is pretty sturdy for the cost. I would suggest this product to just about anyone looking for a kit to make clay earrings or other crafts with. We use with polymer clay so not sure how they would hold up with other clay but they seem to be pretty good quality for so low priced.,5
B0924GVKW2,"Very fast shipping and the product is just like described if not better. It worked really well, and it was made very well thanks again.",5
B0924GVKW2,Love the pouch that it came in! Was so helpful to keep all my tools in one place. Perfect to use with clay!,5
B0924GVKW2,"Overall pretty reasonable cost. Tools are functional. The wooden tools are not very hardy wood, and the plastic tools are very hard and not of much practical use. The metal ones are great. Overall a very reasonable for everything.",4
B0924GVKW2,Bought these for my wife and her polymer clay hobby.  She loves them!,5
B0924GVKW2,Good,5
B0924GVKW2,"I was originally going to get these from HL, but found this full set at a discount. Great price for 25pcs and a storage bag.",5
B0924GVKW2,Good price and nice selection of tools. Quick delivery...Very pleased.,5
B0924GVKW2,"Wanted tools to start going polymer clay jewelry and this had all I needed, definitely worth it!",5
B0924GVKW2,This was a gift to grandchildren ages 9 & 7. They enjoy using modeling clay to create things. This gift let them elevate their art experience with the use of the clay tools (and an unlimited imagination) to develop a variety of unique clay designs,5
B0924GVKW2,"Easy to use, and there are lots of different kinds",5
B0924GVKW2,"As a beginner, this was perfect for learning how to work with clay. There are so many different things you can do with these. There are also double ended tools, so you get even more out of each tool. The zippered bag is perfect for storing them when not in use.",5
B0924GVKW2,"I have to say I'm impressed with this little collection of clay tools. I got them as a gift for a niece who's interested in working with polymer clay. I have some of the same tools myself. I like that they come with a little carrying case to make it convenient. Anybody who's starting out working with polymer clay needs a variety of tools to make the things they want to make. You can spend a lot of money buying all kinds of  tools, or you can buy this set which contains a lot of different kinds of useful tools at a very reasonable price.",5
B0924GVKW2,"Pretty much everything you need to get started sculpting. A wide variety of well built, solid tools that should last awhile if taken proper care of. I'm pretty impressed with the set and the price was nice for what you get.",5
B0924GVKW2,This kit offered a lot of tools for a comparable price with other smaller kits.,5
B0924GVKW2,Excelentes herramientas y muy completas.,5
B0924GVKW2,This kit of many items will help me get started with sculpting and pottery making. Well worth the price for many well made items. Came with a nice little pouch to hold it all.,5
B0924GVKW2,"The clay was harder than concrete and crumbled right in my hands as I tried to nead it, a huge waste of money that I wish I could get back, although I do have the tools for when I do buy a more suitable product.",2
B0924GVKW2,This tool kit is ideal for beginners. It comes with everything you need. Definitely worth the buy. It even comes with a little pouch to carry them in.,5
B0924GVKW2,Works for what we need,5
B0924GVKW2,Purchased these tools for my grandson to use with air dry clay. He absolutely loves them!,5

B0924GVKW2,Christmas gift for Granddaughter.,5
B0924GVKW2,COMPLETELY STUNNED!! All this for $9.99. Best purchase ive made in quite awhile. The quality is crazy good. The metal balls with rubber handles are weighted and feels good in the hand. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!,5
B0924GVKW2,Fell apart after first use,3
B0924GVKW2,When creating with clay these are great tools.,5
B0924GVKW2,It arrived super fast and the quality was good and the bag it came in was good quality :),5
B0924GVKW2,"This is a nice starter kit for someone that works with clay. For the various types of tools that are included in the kit, it was cheaper (money wise) than what I could find at craft stores. Plus, the tools are better quality.",5
B0924GVKW2,"After mild use for a short time two of the pieces had the blue silicone tips pop off. There are still a number of good tools in the pack that work great, however, and I like the pouch they come with :)",3
B0924GVKW2,These are great for homemade clay that the kids like to play with,5
B0924GVKW2,"The tools are great quality and the price is awesome! Although the wooden tools aren't very strong. If you have a heavy hand or put too much pressure on the wood, it will break.",4
B0924GVKW2,"As a beginner, I wish there was an insert identifying the different tools.  Also is missing a cutter and smoother.  However, it did the job for my beginner wheel class.",3
B0924GVKW2,not impressed with the quality of any of the tools.  you get what you pay for.,3
B0924GVKW2,Works well for cosplay.,5
B0924GVKW2,Love this set. Has everything needed for creating small minis.,5
B0924GVKW2,Comes with everything a beginning sculpter could need and a awesome pouch for the tools,5
B0924GVKW2,Easy to teach k8ds tool use.,3
B0924GVKW2,This is a prefect set fo rme,5
B0924GVKW2,This is a great inexpensive starter kit with all the tools needed to hone your skills.,5
B0924GVKW2,The plastic black pieces are almost completely useless because they have a seam on them that interrupts what you're working on. All of the other pieces are great for beginners and pros alike. I'd pay the same amount if they stopped including the black pieces.,3
B0924GVKW2,My daughter is a clay artist and she loved this set of tools,5
B0924GVKW2,I am pleased with this purchase. I expected maybe a handful of tools but it came with more than I expected and at high quality. Thank you!,5
B0924GVKW2,"Was good for my daughter who s just now starting out with clay sculptures, or works just as it should without the very sharp edges",5
B0924GVKW2,Daughter loves great item,5
B0924GVKW2,Blue tipped pieces fall apart very easy  not glued into handle well. but everything else was great.,3
B0924GVKW2,It is a large set with many tools of descent quality and sturdiness to do any of your pottery needs. Great buy!,5
B0924GVKW2,Many pieces warped upon delivery :/  not unusable,3
B0924GVKW2,Works good and good price,3
B0924GVKW2,needs a bigger bag,4
B06Y3T5RV4,They are small and melt fast.  Many vibrant colors.  Good price!!,5
B06Y3T5RV4,"Don't let the size fool you, these are potent wax dyes. I've used liquid dyes and they don't go nearly as far as these do. I only make 8 to 12 candles at a time. I've done three batches and could do at least three more with the basic color that are desired with other colors left over.",5
B06Y3T5RV4,Great colors and value for my buck,5
B06Y3T5RV4,"I have used the color dye for my candle business for a couple of special orders and so far the colors are much brighter than I expected and a little goes a long way. They don't interfere with the normal candle burning process, and don't have a smell either. I have yet to use all of the colors, but the orange will absolutely come out orange and get brighter as you add more chips, and the white is pretty strong as well. They arrived in great shape, but I also bought them after the summer since things get hot where I'm from. I'll update my review as I use more of the colors. Please note that I also use a mix of soy and coconut wax which may create a different retention of colors.",4
B06Y3T5RV4,"Colors melt easily, even with bigger flakes. Each bag is going to last quite awhile for my desired color strength and number of candles. I craft about 50 8oz candles each year. Most afforable way to get a variety of colors than many other brands. Will order again!",5
B06Y3T5RV4,These dyes work so well. They are really pretty to watch when they melt and it takes so much less of these to dye the candle wax than it does for the liquid dye I bought to compare. No smell as far as I can tell.,5
B06Y3T5RV4,Color created a nice bright yellow candle. I am making lemon scented candles. I am very happy with the results. The dye chips melted easily and mixed into wax nicely.,5
B06Y3T5RV4,If you like really vibrant colors like I do then you're going to want to go to liquid dyes and not use these. If you're doing small batches or interesting stuff or pastels these are great. They come with a lot in them but again it's not enough to make a large batch of candles very rich.,4
B06Y3T5RV4,This set offers a great variety of colors that you can mix and match to create custom candle wax colors,5
B06Y3T5RV4,Great Wax for dying - works great in SOY Wax,5
B06Y3T5RV4,"This candle dye kit is great, but you need to add a lot more of the flakes if you want darker colors: when you pour the liquid wax into the vessel, it looks dark but dries light. Everything had a pastel hue, and red turned out orange. See photo.",5
B06Y3T5RV4,"I made 2 red candles that day I got it. Color is great, I would buy again",5
B06Y3T5RV4,When I opened these my thought was jeepers there's so little in these packages what a wasted purchase.  So I mixed up my wax melt brew and tossed in only a tiny piece.  It completely and evenly colored the melted wax.  I am sold on these they will last forever.  My color was actually darker than I wanted the flake could have been torn in half.  I will buy again.,5
B06Y3T5RV4,Highly recommend using this color dye.,5
B06Y3T5RV4,It was packaged safely and the dye colors are fantastic,5
B06Y3T5RV4,"Best color, I will buy it again .",5
B06Y3T5RV4,"Nice colors, works as should.",5
B06Y3T5RV4,Happy with this itam,5
B06Y3T5RV4,Very vibrant colors. Love them!,5
B06Y3T5RV4,"The candle dye was delivered the very next day -- excellent turn-around! My daughter is using the dye for making candles, and she gives your product two thumbs up. She really likes this dye. It's easy to work and colors beautifully!",5
B06Y3T5RV4,Very small quantity but I hope it will be enough,4
B06Y3T5RV4,I used 2 different colors and both of them mixed beautifully with soy candle pellets.There are a great variety of colors included.,5
B07TD99VV9,"I am using this tape for heat press tumblers.The tape itself works for this application.  I seal the seams for, hopefully, seamless graphics.To pull the paper edges together, I tried to attach the tape to one side and pull, but the tape comes off.  Just not strong enough to be able to attach and pull with a few inches on the taped down side.So I do the best I can and it's good enough for tumblers.  I perfected a method that doesn't require such pull force.Tape is easy to remove.  I use some tweezers and pull.  Or I just rip the sublimation paper!I bought again.",5
B07TD99VV9,"You will need scissors to cut this tape so I usually cut several pieces (each piece about 2"" long seems to be long enough) at a time. But it does do its job of holding things in place while you iron. The tape sticks well to fabric which is all I have used it on so far. It will sometimes lift up from the fabric when I move the fabric around if I don't press it down well but most times it stays put. And it holds up to the heat from an easypress mini with no problems. It has been used on about 10 iron-on projects so far and I still have more than half the tape left.",5
B07TD99VV9,"Quick delivery.  Haven't tried, but product looks okay.",5
B07TD99VV9,The tape was well packaged. Good quality and gets the job done.,5
B07TD99VV9,"I use Cricut for a small sticker business on Etsy and eBay. I have tried many different brands of tape and ink but find that with my Cricut press and sticker sheets, Cricut brand items still work better. I gave this 4 stars because it should be offered in larger quantities.It takes a ton of resources to ship across the country, and if we could get even there or four at once, that cost would be reduced.",4
B07TD99VV9,My project came out perfectly.  I will buy this product again,5
B07TD99VV9,"I lucked out and ordered the Cricut heat resistant tape when it was on sale for only $2.99/role. I just happened to look up heat resistant tape on Amazon when I was at Walmart because the price there was $9.99, which I thought was ridiculously overpriced for what it was. I had every intention of buying an off brand but then I saw that the actual Cricut brand was on sale, and got as many as I could, which was 4. It's easy to use and doesn't leave a residue behind after you remove the tape. I got such a great price!",5
B07TD99VV9,Sometimes curls up at ends but most of the time works fine,4
B07TD99VV9,Always the brand I trust for my sublimation. I have never had any issues.,5
B07TD99VV9,"This brand is a luxury to use. I tend to buy in bulk was in a pinch and spent a little extra on this name brand heat tape. Not gonna lie, it's great. No lines, easy to use. I pretty much love it.",5
B07TD99VV9,Great tape for sublimation. Fast shipping! Good price,5
B07TD99VV9,Nice blue clear tape. It works as it is suppose to. Does not melt when using for heat press.,5
B07TD99VV9,"I am new to the sublimation game, and the first few shirts were all slightly shifted until I read about this tape. It makes all the difference!",5
B07TD99VV9,Perfect for doing heat transfers.,5
B07TD99VV9,Good product and good price,5
B07TD99VV9,Way better then yellow. No stains on my tumblers anymore.,5
B07TD99VV9,Igual que en la foto,4
B07TD99VV9,The tape that comes with the tumblers leaves yellow stains on bottom of cup. This tape here is a big improvement.,5
B07TD99VV9,Love this tape and I will buy it again.,5
B07TD99VV9,Used for placement of iron on vinyl.,5
B07TD99VV9,Really like how thick this tape is,5
B07TD99VV9,Keeps your designs stable,5
B07TD99VV9,Wonderful price I paid for this item,5
B07TD99VV9,"If you do a Print and Cut or just print a design to iron on a shirt, shoes, etc.  you need this tape because you don't want your design to move when you press it on.  I prefer the blue tape because the other tape seems to leave marks.",5
B07TD99VV9,Holds really good on material.,5
B07TD99VV9,This heat tape is great! Doesn't leave heat marks like some others I have tried and is decent for the price.,5
B07TD99VV9,The tape helps so much!!! Great product,4
B07TD99VV9,"I heard a review of this on a craft YouTube video. I like it because it is more sturdy that using washi tape. I use it in place of washi, and also it is heat resistant so I use it with my hot foiling machine, to hold the plates together. I bought a cute tape dispenser and keep it handy. I recommend",5
B07TD99VV9,I highly recommend this for your designs! The quality is great and doesnt slide around. Its always good to have for your tshirt designs so you dont struggle! Why struggle!,5
B07TD99VV9,I like this tape way better than the yellow ones. It doesn't leave a mark or color on your shirts. I haven't used any other tape since trying this one.,5
B07TD99VV9,Good,5
B07TD99VV9,perfect tape for heat press,5
B07TD99VV9,Good hold,5
B07TD99VV9,this products is very durable and will purchase again,5
B07TD99VV9,I've been using this to make some pillows with some infusible ink and have not had any issues with marks from the tape like I did other brands. Holds well even on fabric and comes right off.,5
B07TD99VV9,Love this product for making arts and craft. We bought it to make sublimation cups and it works marvelous,5
B07TD99VV9,It did what it was supposed to do. The only problem for me was that it wasn't as sticky as I thought.... So it didn't hold a lot in place.,3
B07TD99VV9,Very misleading picture.  I ordered thinking I would get 2 tapes.  I too didn't read the amount per order.  Won't happen again,4
B07TD99VV9,"Great product, great price, and definitely cheaper than any local storesOrdered multiple times",5
B07TD99VV9,Doesn't leave residue and works great for sublimating tumblers without marks,5
B07TD99VV9,Tape holds your edges in place while heat pressing.,5
B07TD99VV9,"Cricut is cricut. Very good like everything from this brand, easy to use, easy to remove, very good investment.",5
B07TD99VV9,"I like this tape, works well with mugs, on shirts, and tumblers, never a worry about the tape not adhering to the blank...a little goes a long way; I wait until it goes on sale to stock up. it adheres to my projects perfectly; the only reason i didn't give it five stars is because of the cost; it could get quite expensive if not on sale.",5
B07TD99VV9,"I've used other heat tapes, but like the width and strength of this brand",5
B07TD99VV9,The tape works great. Just wish it came with a dispenser,4
B07TD99VV9,"Great heat tape to use with the Cricut Mug Press.  However, I had an issue with it leaving marks when heat pressing shirts and onsies (the plain yellow heat tapes work better for cloth mediums).Arrived fast.",4
B07TD99VV9,Absolutely love this heat resistant tape. Sticks well and easy to remove. Never had an issue.,5
B07TD99VV9,"This tape arrived in a timely manner. It truly met the needs I had when I was considering my purchase.  This product, in my opinion, surpassed all the other products of a similar nature that I reviewed.  I am extremely happy with my purchase, would purchase again, if the need arose, and highly recommend this product.  Enjoy.",5
B07TD99VV9,The only tape I've used. Does the job. No complaints.,4
B07TD99VV9,This tape works very well for my crafting needs.,5
B07TD99VV9,"Goes a long way, works as it should.",5
B07TD99VV9,"love it , this tape works really well for my projects.",5
B07TD99VV9,Best protective heat tape! Leaves no residue!,5
B07TD99VV9,This is a perfect way to hold down an image for heat transfers! Works perfectly.,5
B07TD99VV9,This heat tape is exactly what I expected it to be. Definitely worth it. Easy to use and the adhesive works great. Would recommend!,5
B07TD99VV9,This tape works well when mats are clean and free on hair & other debris.  Tape would work best if it came in a dispenser. It removes from vinyl and ther material easily,5
B07TD99VV9,It was my first time using it and so I was a bit worried in my own head even tho I'd seen it used. One of those things you have to see and do yourself. Well it worked amazingly. Seller was quick to get it to me and it was packaged very well.,5
B07TD99VV9,Would buy more,5
B07TD99VV9,Best tape ever!,5
B07TD99VV9,"Worked really well, must get more",5
B07TD99VV9,This tape works so well. It never leaves any marks on the blanks. It holds everything in place. I have used it on tumblers as well as shirts,5
B07TD99VV9,This tape is cheap but strongly made.,5
B07TD99VV9,This tape is excellent when you heat press an iron on.,5
B07TD99VV9,"This product does not disappoint. It sticks well but is easy to remove. It is a much better buy at Amazon than at the craft stores. And I don't have to fight the crowds either, it ships quickly.",5
B07TD99VV9,"Works pretty great, doesn't leave any type of residue.",5
B07TD99VV9,Excellent product,5
B07TD99VV9,"The adhesion is perfect. I use for sublimating tumblers, coffee mugs and tshirts. I never have residue on my substrates. It is very easy to remove and two dollars cheaper on Amazon than in stores. Love it",5
B07TD99VV9,Works as it should,5
B07TD99VV9,Used for sublimation it worked pretty good. Will purchase again,4
B07TD99VV9,"Love it, works well",5
B07TD99VV9,Good stuff and has never failed me. I like to stock up on this tape!,5
B07TD99VV9,Limited options in size of roll and width. Does job well.Bit pricey so use sparingly for intended use. Likely paying for brand name.,4
B07TD99VV9,Works as it should,5
B07TD99VV9,This tape is great I use it to tape down when I do my sublimation tumblers,5
B07TD99VV9,Goo,4
B088HF5ZQ1,"I've used many glue guns and I was up for a new one.  I wanted cordless but they just don't seem to keep the heat like the plug-ins and after reading review after review, I decided to just go with this plug in with a brand name I love.  I was tired of my old ones dripping and they were bulky so I took a chance on this Gorilla not expecting much.  I'm SO glad I did!  It's a full size gun but it's not bulky like others and the stand works well with no falling over.  NO DRIPS!  Not one and I kept waiting but it does not drip.  It doesn't teeter when you set it down and although it's a plug in, I no longer care.  THIS is worth every penny with no more frustrating drips, falls, and it does have 2 speeds which I never cared about before, but had to secure a ribbon to styrofoam and remembered reading the low speed is necessary, otherwise the foam will melt.  Worked like a charm and glue feeds well.  You really get everything you need with this one.  It also has a great tip on it for fine tuning where you want that glue.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"As expected since it's Gorilla, it's a winner. Heats up quickly and pushes out the glue with a pump of the trigger. Very effective glue. Two heat choices. I used high on my project and was pleased with the results. Comes with a generous supply of glue sticks. I recommend it.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"The Gorilla Dual Temp Full-Size Hot Glue Gun Kit (I also chose the option with 45 hot glue sticks,) heats up quickly. The instructions say approximately 5 minutes and you should probably wait for that time. Using the glue before then does not allow it to melt completely and then adhesion is not as good. So wait for it.While I like the idea of a high/low setting I suspect I will always use high - I seldom do any delicate work. But it is nice having the choice.Something I did not think was a big deal, was the power light. However, I now find it is good to be able to see if the light is on and therefore if the glue gun is still plugged in. It seams a little silly, but, seriously, it helps a lot.The glue gun surface is comfortable, non-slip and does not get hot: only the glue-feeding tip, which is insulated except for the very outside tip, gets hot. The glue sticks fit correctly and feed easily with a squeeze on the trigger. And like all other Gorilla Glue products, this glue really adheres to what you put it on.The power cord is reinforced where it connects with the glue gun body so it will last longer.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,My para and I needed a good gun and glue to decorate a door.  My para says the glue sticks so good she'll need a scraper to get it off.  Good stuff.,4
B088HF5ZQ1,Heated right up and worked as expected.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,,5
B088HF5ZQ1,I like that it doesn't come out of the end until you pull the trigger.  Works very well. Vert smooth,5
B088HF5ZQ1,The purpose for the dual temp glue gun is for heavy projects and it does the job,5
B088HF5ZQ1,This product is a reflection of the reliability and sturdiness in products of this brand.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Purchased this as a gift. Works well, would repurchase.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Worked great.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Heats up quickly. Stand is sturdy. Heat indicator light. I give it a 10.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Works great better than the littler ones ive used before,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Works great as expected,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Although I see other reviews praising this glue gun, it takes forever and a day to heat up. It takes longer than 5 minutes and is still not ready, not even a drip to start on your project.",3
B088HF5ZQ1,"Easy to grip for older hands.Fast shipping, well packaged, works perfectly! A+",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Good bead of glue. Solid construction, however the trigger handle does not always grab the glue stick so you need to push the stick sometimes. Tonight I was pushing the stick and pulling the trigger and the trigger connection broke inside. I broke the plastic trigger post inside the unite. May fault - I applied ""gorilla"" pressure. Past the return window. Complicated to do, but I took it apart and fixed it. The glue sticks are strong, but for bigger jobs I would recommend a professional glue gun",4
B088HF5ZQ1,My one gripe is that the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. There's no on or off switch,3
B088HF5ZQ1,"Works super great, compared to most other brands",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Saw a good deal on this glue gun with a pack of glue sticks and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Heats up pretty fast and the hot temp setting definitely gets the glue's temperature where it should be for maximum stickiness. Haven't used the low setting much but it also got hot enough to melt fast when set to the lower setting which was good to know. The temperature setting switch itself is nice and firm so it can't easily be bumped into the other position when set. The power cord does seem a bit thin in gauge. It doesn't get hot or anything while in use but will definitely be more careful with it versus other tools with beefier cables.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Does a fantastic job,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Have been looking for a glue gun for a while, finally broke down and bought it, works great.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,I really like the sturdiness of this glue gun and it's great for all kinds of projects big and small.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"The gun works great. The glue sticks need to be a little longer. It takes a full glue stick to get it down to the warmer. Other than that, it's a glue gun.",4
B088HF5ZQ1,Worst Greek put on my projects,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Would recommend.  Heats quickly to a good temperature.  Sets up quickly.  Does not drip.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I use my glue guns frequently - both standard size and mini - I am asking myself ""Where have these Gorilla Glue Guns been all my life?  Why didn't I try these before??""Having purchased both the standard and mini together to add to my two current guns (before those two should fail me) I can say without a doubt that these are the best I have ever used over the many years I have been using glue guns.>  Both are comfortable to hold and use - the mini may not be for those with large hands, but it is great for me.> They heat up FAST.> The built in stands actually work well, and the reason is because they very SMARTLY made the bottom of the handle a flat stabilizing surface that works together with the stand to make these very stable when you sit them down.I highly recommend these for anyone who is a serious glue gun user.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I wasn't sure about the quality of this and went on reviews. Instead of spending over 100 on a pro gun, I thought I'd give this a try. It does not disappoint! It quickly heats melts glue. some of my favorite features: The glue sticks are fed all the way into the heating tube and stay put, and adding an additional stick is fine because they don't fall out! The glue melt quickly so you're not pumping the gun, then waiting forever for more to melt between pumps. The grip, handle, and body of the gun are sturdy and feel really nice in the hand. I do wish the stand was more substantial and the cord was longer, but that's nothing when everything else is so great. I highly recommend!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I recently purchased the Gorilla Dual Temperature Glue Gun for my crafting projects, and I have to say I am extremely pleased with its performance. While it takes about 2 minutes to warm up, the glue gun works exceptionally well. The dual temperature feature is very convenient, allowing me to switch between temperatures depending on the project.Additionally, the built-in stand is a great added feature, making it easier to use without the risk of damaging surfaces. I highly recommend this glue gun for anyone looking for a reliable and versatile tool for their crafting needs.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,I use it to glue up my Christmas lights. They pull down after Christmas.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Got fed up with cheap no name versions. This was inexpensive and has turned out to be really good. Heats up quickly, does not squirt glue all over the place and is very controllable. The glue is not bad. I had a strip of leds that get warm and this finally solved their regular collapse. Recommended.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"The Gorilla brand glue really is strong and durable. Quick to cure too. The heater gun works perfectly and heats up moderately quickly. Go for the full size and you can do tons of projects around the home, garage, and even garden!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Well, being such a well-known brand with glues thought I would go with these guys when I wanted a glue gun.When I got it, Nice, Colorful, Compact, and wobbly wait wobbly?Yea, strange, thought a well-known company would have spent a little more time checking quality control, guess not.Like maybe open one up when they got here from China and check out how it was made!Anyway, it works as it should I guess, melts the glue, sticks thing together (I hope) but requires a little modification to get it to stand up correctly.You need to either on a flat piece of sandpaper or as I did with a broad file/sand the foot at the bottom of the handle flat (it's not) so it sits flat, but also have to bend straighten the wire support stand that folds out in the front of the gun that it rests on to keep it upright! It only took a few minutes, not hard to do, and very stable now,  and for the price for a dual temp (H/L) compact Colorful! Gun, I'm satisfied! and would buy it again.Talk to your manufacturer Gorila Guy, they are not doing it right!",4
B088HF5ZQ1,"As an audio tech working on Harleys, there are times when I need to temporarily hold wires and other parts.  A good, and wise, friend suggested a hot glue gun.  Boy was he right!  After researching several, I decided on the Gorilla Glue gun and I LOVE IT!!!  It works great, heats up within 5 minutes, and the glue STICKS very well!  Money well spent!!!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Works great,5
B088HF5ZQ1,I love this glue gun. My other glue gun I had for 30 for years. It did not have a metal stand to help it stand up and I had to lay it down on a paper plate or tin foil and it would always stick to those things. This is much better well made sturdy and does a great job. I bought this to replace my old one and I love any product from gorilla glue because I can truly depend on gorilla glue to really be the best glue This does a great job I highly recommend this.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Needed a new glue & gun. I like the feature of just pulling the trigger to advance the glue stick. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of glue sticks you got. That was a bargain,5
B088HF5ZQ1,This hot glue gun is incredible. I was so impressed with the quality. I needed a glue that would hold wood branches together. This worked fantastic.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"As a non-crafty guy, I bought this because it was a good brand and it came with a big pack of glue sticks and a great price! It was easy to use and well worth the price!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,should have got this long time ago .,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I am so in love with this glue gun! I bought it to replace a gun by Ad Tech because that one didn't regulate the heating and caused 3rd degree burns from the glue (not the gun, mind you, the glue it released burnt through my finger!), so my expectations were only ""please don't burn my skin off!"" However, not only does this work fantastic on both heat settings, the tip does not drip and the trigger has great control over the amount of glue released and stops releasing as soon as you stop pressing the trigger, something I've never encountered in 25 years of using all types of glue guns! As for the glue itself, I have been using Gorilla Hot Glue exclusively for the last 4 years, it is a better glue than all others available period. The glue leaves less strings, holds up longer in extreme hot and cold weather, and is as close to invisible as can be and that is just not true of other lesser glues. All around thrilled with my purchase!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Let it heat up & go too town, also bought bag of 45 glue sticks, works terrific.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Great glue gun, it does drip a little but all that I've owned have done that. heats up fast and nice having dual temp",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Works OK, stand is worthless. I probably will invest in one that has a better stand and I will want it to take longer glue sticks because ran through these like nothing.",3
B088HF5ZQ1,Very good! I thought I ordered cordless however this product is excellent!,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I don't actually find this gun to be very overwhelming. It's extremely slow to warm up. Doesn't seem to draw the glue through very well with the trigger either. I spend quite a bit of time multiple pumping it, or just simply manually pushing the glue sticks through. Additionally, the glue sticks that came with it are not all that great. I find their adhesion to be mediocre at best. A number of joints that I've made came apart quite easily. I'll probably toss this thing in the trash and go look for another one.",3
B088HF5ZQ1,Awesome Awesome product.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Built a cardboard sled this year and needed a new hot glue gun.  This gun did the job.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,I expected more. Similar to other glue guns. Did the job but nothing special,4
B088HF5ZQ1,"This gun is very reliable , heats up fairly quickly and is very sturdy. But most of all the hot/cold stitch won't  accidently get flipped and it's hard to knock over haha That may not sound like a big advantage but it really makes a diference. I'd buy it again.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I have arthritis & have found it very comfortable to use.The trigger is very easy to use, and I'm able to control the amount of flow of the glue.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Great glue gun! Takes awhile to heat up. But works awesome!,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I love everything about this! The stand, the heat control which is basically hot or very hot, but it works for my projects and crafts. I'm extremely happy with it.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"The adjustable temperature setting is a nice feature, and the trigger is very ergonomic. However, if you are looking to use this to melt wax sticks, it will make a huge mess. The design of the gun allows the wax to seep through the crack in the bottom and It continuously leaks.",3
B088HF5ZQ1,"Great glue gun. But the red rubber tip did not stay on. Also,  would be great if the opening where the glue came out was narrower would make for better precision for projects.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,I love everything about this glue,5
B088HF5ZQ1,it is very easy to go around different places that you have to glue I would differently recommend the gorillaglue gun,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I have several glue guns but also have many hobbies and rooms devoted.I was looking for just Gorilla Glue sticks. When I looked at the price of sticks and saw this combo deal with 2 temp gun , I pulled the trigger.I like the ergonomics of this gun and the two temp levels. I build prototype electronics and put them in enclosures. Instead of using standoffs drilling etc. I mount my boards using hot glue for the first couple units.This gun and glue works out great for me and is dedicated to that lab bench.Great purchase, nice gun , versatile glue.Enjoy",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"WORKS GREAT, 4 STICKING STUFF TOGETHER !!!!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Several months in and this has been a very useful tool (especially for the price).  Have used this to repair a number of household items and furniture without issues.,4
B088HF5ZQ1,I have only used it 2 or 3 times and each time was great because I finally have a great glue gun. The glue gun is so easy to use and feed the glue on. I hope that it will stay that way because I have so many projects I want to do.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Loved using this for Halloween light decorating. Plan on using it for Christmas too!,5
B088HF5ZQ1,I was expecting  something a little more sturdy from Gorilla. It works but it's very flimsy and sharp edges from poor molding.,3
B088HF5ZQ1,This product was included as a search result for cordless full size glue guns. It was a trusted brand so I made the purchase. Upon arrival I saw it was a corded tool. I decided to keep it but was disappointed in the overall experience. I just hope it works well.,4
B088HF5ZQ1,"Under the tip at the seam where comes together between trigger an tip, pulled apart allowing hot glue to seep out and burn fingers.By the time I used it the return time expired.",3
B088HF5ZQ1,This hot glue gun is the best I've ever owned! Love the dual temp option. Easy to use. Not messy. And love the kickstand to set aside when you're working on a project. Highly recommend this hot glue gun over others.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I would add a photo but the plate I was using was covered in glue from my previous glue gun. I just received this yesterday. I went to work making a project when I got home from work. I used low for tacking my sticks together and then high to affix them to the cardboard. What can I say? No drips, no strings of glue, precise placement. It is what I was hoping to get after reading about this glue gun. I have not used a full stick whereas when I did this same project I went through 2 1/2 sticks. I am pleased so far.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,I would recommend getting the glue sticks with the glue gun and it heats up quickly for projects. The glue has a strong hold.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"No off switch, nozzel size is large which would be good for boards but not crafts",2
B088HF5ZQ1,"My old glue gun died, and purchased this new one.  It is fantastic, stands on its own and doesn't get really hot like the old glue gun.  The amount of glue that is expelled is just right for my craft projects.  A great buy.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Works very good,5
B088HF5ZQ1,I did a test on an old towel to see how strong and the next day I tried to pull it apart but the towel ripped with the glue still intact.  So the gun and the glue are great and I am so glad I ordered it!  Don't hesitate just buy it!,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Great Value,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Always went for the mini glue gun but I had a bigger project to work so I purchased this. Way easier to to hold and grip and won't kill your fingers. super quick to heat up with 2 different settings. It also grips the 2nd glue stick well when you're low and won't fall out like the other guns.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I was a little upset at first. I plugged in the glue gun and waited for it to get hot so that I could use it. At first, it wouldn't really come out, but it has worked amazingly since! I love my hot glue gun!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Nice simple glue gun.  Heats up quick enough, stands on it's own, and loads easy.  Good addition to my toolbox for small wood projects, small fixes to household items, and great for mocking up fixtures in the garage.",4
B088HF5ZQ1,Works great. Ergonomic.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"I really had a difficult time trying to choose a hot melt glue gun that was going to be reliable, easy to control glue flow and not cost a fortune. Well this was just what I was looking for! It is very well heat insulated, has a large trigger for easy glue control and it has dual temperature control so both high and low temperature glue sticks may be used. Very pleased with glue strength and hold to many different surfaces.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,I like this glue gun works great & can dispense glue in a thin line or thick,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Exactly as described,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Excellent hot glue gun. I haven't used a big one in years, but my small one just wasn't cutting it on my latest project. It takes a little while to heat up, but not terrible, and works very well once going. I use it mostly on low heat, except when I need alot of glue fast, and have run about a pack of glue sticks through it without issue. Much easier than constantly feeding small glue sticks into my other one.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"It's not a bad unit, and takes the normal 'long time' to come to temperature.  I keep it on 'High' temperature and it has served me well.",4
B088HF5ZQ1,everything is good but the temperature is not hot enough to stick on between metals.,4
B088HF5ZQ1,"Online comparisons were correct, best hot glue gun for the money.",5
B088HF5ZQ1,Glad I took a chance and purchase this glue gun.  Once I figured out how to use it it was smooth sailing from there.  I especially like the fact that you can regulate the temperature.This is the best glue gun I have owned thus far.  I highly recommend.,5
B088HF5ZQ1,Wife won't let me use hers so this one's is mine!! So there..,5
B088HF5ZQ1,"Heats up quickly, stays hot and glue doesn't drip out when not pulling the trigger. Great purchase!",5
B088HF5ZQ1,"The glue sticks are very short and it doesn't allow you to use just one the whole way, you have to put a second one in order to push the first one in the machine and use it entirely. Bad design!",3
B07BKYH2G5,"I love it. So easy to use. It has a blade lock, which is good. The size is right to hold. Cuts very nicely on the material. Just can't say enough good things about it. Very sturdy and a great price.  The color is a very pretty teal.",5
B07BKYH2G5,Product is very good for the price.  I'm happy with the Rotary Cutter.,5
B07BKYH2G5,"This is a nice cutting tool, I like the locking option for safety and the extra blades.  I will look into different blade types in the future as they are all the straight ones.",5
B07BKYH2G5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Works well with cutting and very sharp. I like the safety feature and easy to hold. I got this cause it came with blades as well. I had to replace the blade on my other roller I had and it was cheaper to just buy the set.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Wonderful item! Cuts through multiple layers of fabric like it's soft butter! Will never purchase another type if I can avoid it. The ball bearings make a complete world of difference.,5
B07BKYH2G5,"Dull, cheap",3
B07BKYH2G5,"Headly tools Rotary cutter is such a great tool, I cant even count how much time it has saved me. It comes with a decent amount of replacement blades, but im still using the original blade that was on it when delivered. Its light weight but feels durable,",5
B07BKYH2G5,The cutter is very easy to use and cuts very well. I use it for making homemade greeting cards.,5
B07BKYH2G5,the handle gets stuck.  The blade does not cut through fabric always. Snags a lot,4
B07BKYH2G5,This is so much nicer to work with than the regular rotary cutters. Being able to hold in the grip is nice and the handle shape is wonderful,5
B07BKYH2G5,Excellent rotary cutter. Very sharp and quick,5
B07BKYH2G5,Its cuts nice & clean & the price is unbelievable. I love it because a rotary cutter.,5
B07BKYH2G5,SHARP!! Love it for blanket making!,5
B07BKYH2G5,"I really like using it. It has sped up my process so much. Lines are clean. It is very sharp. Even with the safety lock on it, I still managed to cut my finger while using it. But that's on me. LOL",5
B07BKYH2G5,"Love this tool. I have three, two in sewing room. For quilting and just dress making.I got one for the leather work and it takes more upper body strength but for those long cuts it's great",5
B07BKYH2G5,Love it,5
B07BKYH2G5,It was comfortable to use . Worked well on various materials I had.  I bought one for my daughter.,4
B07BKYH2G5,I use it to cut basswood. It works for what I want.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Great for a lefty! Very comfortable,5
B07BKYH2G5,Very pleased with the cutter and blades.  Will purchase again as a backup set.,5
B07BKYH2G5,"As easy as it sounds, you need to practice a couple times with the cutter to figure out how much pressure to use to cut. Works great now.",5
B07BKYH2G5,Ok,5
B07BKYH2G5,Works well.  Don't do alot of quilting but works for me.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Cuts great!,5
B07BKYH2G5,This is wonderful! Works so great! Such a smooth roll and very sharp so it cuts right away!,5
B07BKYH2G5,"Nice quality product, works great!",5
B07BKYH2G5,Cutter seemed very sharp for a straight cut,4
B07BKYH2G5,How did I go this long without this tool!!! It works even better than expected. Fits great in the hand and smooth in cutting!!! I have nothing negative to say about this tool. It's the best!!,5
B07BKYH2G5,This tool is perfect for cutting vinyl off my vinyl cutter. No longer need to use a razor blade to remove the vinyl!,5
B07BKYH2G5,First time I have used a rotary blade and I'm very impressed.  IT cut my fabric very easily..,5
B07BKYH2G5,What a good deal!  Works just great.,5
B07BKYH2G5,This is my new favorite rotary cutter. It glides like a dream. The handle is super comfortable in my hand. The blades it comes with are excellent quality.,5

B07BKYH2G5,I bought one for my daughterGoid value for $,5
B07BKYH2G5,Great cutting tool for fabric!,5
B07BKYH2G5,"I can't brag enough about Headley rotary cutters and blades. The cut as smooth as butter with the bearing design, and Headley blades stay sharp a long time.  I own a 45 mm and a 60 mm. They surpass other rotary cutters I have owned.",5
B07BKYH2G5,Very sturdy. Blades are good quality.,5
B07BKYH2G5,"Ordered two, the first one was great.  Had to return the second one because it didn't  work.",4

B07BKYH2G5,"I Love this fabric cutter. I have a collection of those i bought and didn't like, this one i will always use.",5
B07BKYH2G5,"Like the larger wheel of rotary cutter, handles well and easy to use. Will be used for Little Dress Project at our church",4
B07BKYH2G5,"The blades and rotary tool are well made. I like the handle shape of the rotary cutter.  It allows for very firm grip and the storage container for blades is compact and closes securely.  I would recommend purchasing from this seller.  Product arrived promptly, placed in secure location by driver and appears as advertised.",5
B07BKYH2G5,It is super sharp! Be careful when handling this. I accidentally cut a big slice in my finger but it works great. It is perfect for fabric.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Seems to work ok. I thought the curve would have a more ergonomic feel but it just feels ok. I like the fact that extra blades were provided. I have not tried to change the blade yet. Definitely saves a lot of time.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Blades dull super fast,4
B07BKYH2G5,Great product works like it is supposed to,4
B07BKYH2G5,Purchased this to replace my other one. Works great. Comfortable in my small hands.,5

I've had my cutter for at least 4 years now and just bought a 2nd so two of us can be cutting disposable tablecloths at the same time to make our custom backdrops. Our most recent was made for Pampers and they'll be using it all over the country at conventions. I've used this cutter for fabric as well and it works fantastic!! 10/10 highly recommend :),5
B07BKYH2G5,"I can use this, but I should have bought the Fiskars",4
B07BKYH2G5,Purchased to cut ribbon for my wreath making.  NOTE: it's very sharp.  Cut the tip of my finger off - user error!,5
B07BKYH2G5,"Good quality, love the color option we purchased pink. My daughter has been very creative with her clothing lately due to drama club. This product has an easy way of changing your fits to match your style. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next. Would be a good  Christmas gift for crafting or designing clothes.",5
B07BKYH2G5,"I have been sewing for 65 years and decided to try the cutting mat and roller cutter, it sure is easy and makes cutting out very easy.  Wish I had these items years ago.",5
B07BKYH2G5,"Bought this to cut up a bunch of fabric and it worked out perfectly. The blades are extremely sharp and seem to last forever. Very easy to use and I love that the blade can be placed on either side, making it Left Handed friendly!",5
B07BKYH2G5,"This rotary cutter is easy to handle however, the blade is not sharp - I had to cut 2, sometimes 3 times to finish a 3 1/2"" block.  The blade is smaller than a 45mm blade (looks more like 28 mm). Price is good for a ""beginner"" but for those of us who must replace our rotary cutters for every project (my last Fiskars I replaced after 6 years) I don't mind paying higher price, but I always try different ones just to see what other options are available. This product will be put to good use - I will use this for my crafts - but not for quilting or sewing",3
B07BKYH2G5,Sharp and cuts well,4
B07BKYH2G5,I am getting used to having to push a button to lock the blade in place and that's why I gave it 3 stars.  Overall it's a nice rotary cutter and easy to handle.  I'm liking the pink color which makes it first in my quilting supplies.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Love how it just cuts through clothes like nothing! Definitely recommend!,5
B07BKYH2G5,"This thing cuts through fabric, no matter how thick, like a knife thru butter. But boy is it SHARP!! Be extra careful with it. I just touched it and got cut. Ouch. It works great. It's very accurate and sturdy. It has a great safety feature, I was careless. The size is perfect. The color is pretty.",5
B07BKYH2G5,"Better feel, than the last several cutters I have used.  Very pleased",5
B07BKYH2G5,Bought to cut fabric for a no-sew fleece blanket.  Great concept but wouldn't cut through the fleece.,3
B07BKYH2G5,It makes cutting easy and the size makes it easy to control. I like the different blades it comes with.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Once I figured out the correct attachment procedure for the blade(s) it worked quite well. The directions for the blade attachment are lacking clarity.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Cutting some burlap deco mesh was difficult until I ordered this rotary cutter.  Worked great cutting it and helped save time.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Very easy to use. It is comfortable in my hand and it's squeeze and cut mechanism makes it especially safe. No more forgetting to close the blade after each cut. Especially safe because of the locking button that makes it great for a quilter with little ones. The pink is pretty!,5
B07BKYH2G5,Throw away your scissors! This cutter is so easy to use! Now I can cut my ribbons with a nice clean cut! Even comes with a replacement blade.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Does what it's supposed to.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Meet expectations.,5
B07BKYH2G5,"Fantastic rotary cutter! I've been sewing for 50yrs and have had several cutters. These can't be beat! Lightweight, lock button, and extra blades WITH case!",5
B07BKYH2G5,"If you are wanting to purchase this for the skip stitch blade be aware the one shown is not the one received. I ordered this specifically because it was suppose to have the skip stitch blade I needed to make a Christmas gift. Unfortunately the one shown with the correct teeth spacing is not the one included. The teeth are much closer together and tiny on the one received which will not work for what I need. I am so disappointed, as now I can not make the gift I intended to make. It is a shame when sellers show one thing and send another. If you want this for the other blades, they do seem sharp but are thin. Not sure how well they would hold up over time. I would rate the quality as ok. Usable. You should also know, this is not interchangeable with other 45mm cutter blades. The way it is designed, only blades made for this specific cutter would work. Sadly this has been a poor choice for me.",2
B07BKYH2G5,"Simple. Cutting is good, sturdy, great size, great utility knife, blad does not slip, great value for money",5
B07BKYH2G5,I liked that I was able to cut chiffon easily.,5
B07BKYH2G5,I like it. The safety feature is nice,5
B07BKYH2G5,"This  rotery  cutter  is  wonderful, it  does  a very  good job.  Easy  to cut.",5
B07BKYH2G5,This was a great buy for the money spent.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Just cuts so well,5
B07BKYH2G5,Very sharp. Works equally as well as a name brand cutter.  In fact i have found that my name brand (Fiskers) is designed in a way that it is easy to accidently hit the retract blade button while cutting with pressure. I don't have this accidental blade retraction issue with this cutter like i do with the Fiskers.,5
B07BKYH2G5,"I have bought numerous rotary cutters,  spent big bucks on some of them,  and this one,  which was very reasonably priced,  is one of the best ones I've ever had.  Sharp blade,  cuts super smooth.  I love it! Will buy again when I wear this one out!",5
B07BKYH2G5,"Works but the screw kept coming out so I had to stop and screw it in a couple of times.  Then it seemed to hold after a few times b/c I ended up using it many many more times.  For the price, I'm okay with that.",4
B07BKYH2G5,I had an OLFA and noticed the blade was wobbling and couldn't be tightened any tighter.  It was fairly new so went with another brand.  This one cuts so easily which is important because I have pain in my right elbow most of the time. (it has been replaced twice) I find that this cuts great with almost no pain in my elbow even through 4 layers of material.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Bought this cutter for my wreath making and I like it. It's  sharp and easy to handle it. The price is very good and it comes with blades. Awesome purchase  highly recommend this.,5
B07BKYH2G5,Having trouble with the blade screw staying tight. I have to retighten it every few cuts.,3
B07BKYH2G5,Quick dull,4
B07BKYH2G5,Curs clean! I was nervous the blades would not be sharp enough but i was wrong :),4
B07BKYH2G5,I love this little beauty to cut my vinyl and flock for my cutting machine which is exactly what I purchased it for. It was very affordable and the locking blade is a good safety feature. The only suggestion is a little more in depth instructions. Otherwise a great purchase.,4
B07BKYH2G5,Blade quality was hard and sharp. The size fits perfect in your hand. Grip is comfortable.  Makes jobs go by faster,5
B001145342,Love this product. I use it to spray cheer bows to make them stiff. You have to use a lot of the product and make the bows look wet for them to become stiff. I bought 1 bottle and did about 30 bows and had about 1/4 of the bottle left. Pump does get jammed so be prepared to clean out the pump periodically,4
B001145342,"Worked really well, you need to spray a lot of it but it was exactly what I was was looking for",5
B001145342,Very easy to work with and does a great job stiffening up fabric without causing any discoloration.,5
B001145342,This does not make anything stiff at all waste of money,3
B001145342,"For crafters - such as for making bookmarks- this spray stiffens the fabric and helps it hold its shape.  I like to make bookmarks out of left over quilting fabric, and they always ended up too floppy to be an effective bookmark.  This spray gives them more structure and makes them more useful.",5
B001145342,this works well for what I use it for (pillow cases for a bit of extra support when sleeping). It is tiresome being in a manual pump spray bottle though. If it was in an aerosol can it would be much better (and less finger ache!) and also far easier to apply evenly,4
B001145342,"The spray works. However, the bottle is for a big hand, and it is difficult for me to press it for the spray.",4
B001145342,Ok,5
B001145342,"I am a designer (and author) of crochet garments and accessories and design a lot of purses. The last purse I designed and made for a publisher to be in a book was really too flimsy to stand on its on & I knew I had to do something to help the stuffiness of it before sending it to the publisher. I normally line all my purses with pretty fabric and use a sturdy stabilizer such as Pellon that you buy at a fabric store (or Amazon). I didn't have time to line this particular bag or use a stabilizer (and the publisher didn't require that) but I knew I had to come up with something to stabilize the purse! I just looked for a fabric stabilizer at JoAnn Fabrics and found this one. It worked so well but I needed more. So I found it here on Amazon and bought 2 more bottles. Like I said, it does stabilize a flimsy bag, but I had to spray it more than once to get the result I wanted. Just spray it again after it dries. I was very happy with it! I can't show a picture of the bag yet, because it hasn't been published but after the book is released, I'll update this review with a photo of the purse. I have a swatch of the crochet fabric I made and can show how this stiffiner works!",5
B001145342,I used this to stiffen the brim of a straw hat. It did the job very well.,5
B001145342,Allow to completely dry for as long as directions say to dry and then allow it to dry for a couple more hours. And its wonderful!,5
B001145342,"I made bows for the captain of a cheer team. This spray worked and did not have an over powering smell. I applied a few coats and had a foam roll in each of the loops to allow it to dry. At this point in the season, the bows are not as stiff as the first few months.",4
B001145342,No need to soak your straw hat in this. Mine turned into paper mache and now I have to toss it haha I tried throwing it in the washing machine by itself and it is still strangely stiff.,4
B001145342,The spray arrived with gripper tape around where the lid should have been but no lid was attached. I looked for it in the package and it wasn't there. I'm hoping this keeps without the lid. Kinda disappointed.,3
B001145342,Had to spray my item numerous times,4
B001145342,"I use this spray on macrame feathers. It took several coats, but it stiffened enough to hold the shape.",5
B001145342,"If your project isn't as stiff as you desire, you can keep adding more coats. I find it very useful. The sprayer worked fine at first, then it came out in big drops, then it didn't come out at all. I cleaned the sprayer thoroughly, but still doesn't work. I bought a new spray bottle, as I intend to keep using the product. It would be ridiculous to have to buy another container, if you were only using it occasionally. This is typical of so many products. I find it odd that 20 years ago they were able to make spray bottles that worked, and could be refilled, but today they fail.",4
B001145342,I purchased this item to stiffen my crochet doilys and it work beautifully. It drys clear and fast and leaves no residue!,5
B001145342,This is a great product for fabric stiffening and I thought it would work well for my crocheted earrings but it does not stiffen as well on crochet thread.,4
B001145342,I use this to stiffen up some of my macrame pieces to keep them from drooping. Works pretty good,5
B001145342,I used several coats on some tulle on a hat I made for my sister.  I mailed the hat to sis and it survived a trip from Kansas to Texas via  USPS looking as crisp as when I packed it,5
B001145342,"I got this hoping to stiffen up a couple T-shirts for my husband that are soft & flimsy. It worked SO good with the first misting, that I was very happy with that and didn't need any more. *I have not tried to wash them yet, so I'm not sure how that will go, but wanted to let people know it does what it says for sure and would work great for crafting. TIP: Start out a little at a time and wait for layers to dry before coating again. Also keep in mind it's tacky at first until it dries.",5
B001145342,"Have to say it doesn't stiffen as well as I initially thought it would. Need a lot!Then there's the smell, it's not bad but when you are using a lot of it - it gets strong. Doesn't go away as much as I thought. I say this because I used it to stiffen the sides of a cat cave, the sides needed to stay up so the cave did not collapse on the cat. Left the cave alone for more than a month so the smell would dissipate some, still seems to be strong. Have to neutralize it with some vinegar because washing it would defeat the purpose. Maybe make an odorless one?",4
B001145342,"If you got a felt hat with a floppy brim you want to stiffen it up, this is the stuff!",5
B001145342,"I followed the directions closely.  I sprayed it on lace doilies to attempt to shape them.  I used cardboard rolls to try to get them to dry in the raised shape that I had seen in pictures.  I applied 3 spray coats and while they looked great for about 3-4 days, the doilies were flat by the end of the week.  It seems I must need to apply at lot more spray to see if it will work longer.  But I wouldn't have expected that I would have to do more than 3 applications.  Not as simple as the directions seemed to imply.",3
B001145342,Easy. Spray till.wet then allow to dry.. couldn't be easier.,5
B001145342,good quality,5
B001145342,I recently started making bows and this product helped Keep the shape for my over the top hair bows...it takes a few sprays but comes out clear without staining the fabric and no smell,5
B001145342,"I was very hesitant to order this, and to my delight..it eorks",5
B001145342,The price was reasonable.,5
B001145342,"It's not often that a product lives up to its hype, but this one did. My husband used it to stiffen the brim on a straw hat, and it worked perfectly.",5
B001145342,"I bought this because I was trying to repurpose a cloth gift bag into a trash can, but it didn't stiffen the fabric at all. I was pretty disappointed it was worthless for my needs. I guess it works on yarn?",2
B001145342,"It works but drying time is actually 24 hours.(I live in a literal desert so no, humidity is NOT to blame.)",3
B001145342,I used it on felt and it just didn't work as I had hoped.,3
B001145342,This stuff works great! I seen a video where someone used it and had to try it. I will definitely use this as my go to and would definitely recommend it!,5
B001145342,"I am using this product in a pretty large amount to help make a large crochet basket.  The finger pump this product comes with is really hard to use, so if you have a project that is not very small, consider getting your own dispenser and pouring the fabric stiffener in there so you can dispense the product more easily, with the whole hand and a proper trigger.",4
B001145342,This works about the same as spray starch. You have to apply and the dry several times and still the item is not stiff. A waste of money. I will not buy again.,2
B001145342,Recommend for any fabric stiffening craft your doing. It does take a little while to dry and will get the fiber messed up if touched (by all 7 children that walk past it couldn't help themselves I literally had to hide it to dry),4
B001145342,Be advised it will take approx 1 bottle per hat to get it appropriately stiffened,4
B001145342,"It works on felt and straw hats.  Spray on, shape your hat, use something to keep the shape while drying then wear it.  Use as much as you need.",5
B001145342,I love this works so well I make and sell wreaths I use it on them and the hair bows .,5
B001145342,I wish I knew that my starch could have worked just as well. Would have expected more stiffness.,3
B001145342,It dries fast and good product. It works!,5
B001145342,"This is my favorite fabric stiffener and I've tried many, including homemade recipes. Depending on the fabric, it can dry a little darker and take away a touch of the sheen on silk dupioni which is my case, but it overall, it works really well.I create handmade, pressed fabric flowers with this product for my business and have gone through many bottles of the stuff. I love that it has very little odor (something I know my customers wouldn't hesitate to tell me about) and it prevents the fabric from fraying somewhat when it's cut. I saturate my fabric before leaving it to dry completely for a few hours, however, you can also dilute the product with water for less stiffness. It's also very easy to clean up and if you need to, you can also wash it out of your project completely and then start again. I believe the packaging has changed somewhat recently from peach to blue and white which is different than shown but it bears no affect. Stiffen Quik is an essential tool in my creative process and I wouldn't do without it.",5
B001145342,"This does work well on macrame cord that is brushed out. I used it on the angel wings, wings were stiff and held up very well.",5
B001145342,"I made a handkerchief wreath. It was very floppy, so I used this spray. I sprayed front and back and let it dry. The wreath needed several more applications front and back, but eventually became stiff enough to hang up. The nice thing is it washes out if the handkerchiefs will be used for a different project.",5
B001145342,"I bought this for my daughters witch hat for her Halloween costume, which was completely flaccid. I was skeptical, but it worked like a charm! It definitely took a lot longer to dry than I thought, but I saturated it, and it stands straight up and the rim is firm. Love this product!",5
B001145342,Bought this for  my husband  cowboy hats works great.i have re ordered it,5
B001145342,Only thing about this product is it was open and spilled out half the bottle. But it was in a ziplock bag only a small amount was on the other products in the box.,4
B001145342,Works as intended,5
B001145342,Great product,5
B001145342,"This is the second time I've gotten this and it works well. However, this time it was wrapped  in a bag and a strip was around the top to keep it from leaking. Despite all of that,  it had leaked into the package.  When I actually unwrapped it, the lid was barely even screwed on. About 1/4 of the liquid had leaked out. I don't think that it was wrapped at all the first time I bought it, and it was fine. Lol. Luckily the other iTunes in the box were wrapped too and weren't harmed. Otherwise, great product!",4
B001145342,"The product was easy to use and produced a smooth and stiffened cotton shirt but the flakes were an issue. Flakes aren't as noticeable on white garments but unsightly on medium - to - dark colors.Additionally, the burnt spray starch bits that stay on the faceplate of the iron are almost impossible to remove. The baked-on starch can't be sufficiently removed from the iron but it will transfer onto the next garment that you try to iron.Overall - this is a pass.",2
B001145342,"This was just what I needed!  I sewed a blouse with a thin chiffon and I had no idea how I was going to do it well.  The product sprayed onto my fabric like hairspray (I lived on the wild side and didn't even cover my laminate table before spreading out the fabric and spraying it till it was damp).  I blow dried it with a hair dryer, and the fabric definitely was stiff instead of slinky once it dried.  Perfect!  My stitches looked great and I had no trouble with my machine, except for the couple of places where I accidentally missed applying the product and it was too slippery.  Then my machine and needle protested and I had some problems. Stiffen Quik made a huge difference! I will definitely use this product again when I sew with chiffon!  Oh, and by the way, it washed right out and the blouse is back to it's slinky texture!",5
B001145342,Takes quite some time to dry even when lightly spraying and does yellow even after an hour or so on cotton blends.,3
B001145342,"I sprayed a little on my organza ribbon & tried to curl it, it worked.  My satin ribbon I soaked, it may need more treatments.  But I am loving it so far.  I'm making a scrapbook for my granddaughter & needed ribbon that didn't fray & that was stiff.  Great product & shipped fast.",5
B001145342,"I bought this to make Halloween ghosts for outside. I put some cheesecloth over a ballon and sprayed this stuff liberally, waited for it to dry, it was a little stiff but definitely not going to hold its shape, so I did another coat, then another. Yeah, after a bunch of coats, I just had a sticky mess that never quite dried (indoors) and never held its shape.Since it was laying around, I tried reupholstering a small lampshade with success! I sprayed the lampshade, put the fabric on, was able to reposition it when it got little crooked, but it held enough to keep it on smoothly. I used a few plastic clips, let it dry, and I have a very nice looking lampshade. I'm planning on doing a few more!",3
B001145342,"Got this to spray on handmade cheer bows to make them stiff. The product worked, but left a white film on the darker colored fabric. The spray is a nice idea but it comes out to fast and isn't a sheer spray, it kind of just dumps the product out.",4
B001145342,Works perfectly to stiffen ribbon for bows and other projects. Definitely recommend,5
B001145342,"It is clear, and does work, but for me the spray mechanism was stiff, especially for the at least 50 pumps of it I needed to use to make my floppy hat brim obey me when I shaped it.",3
B001145342,"This does do a fine job of stiffening straw hats, however the pump  bottle it comes in is very low quality.  The spray delivery is uneven and sometimes doesn't work at all - despite many attempts to clean the nozzle.  Had to buy a separate spray bottle for this product.",3
B001145342,Thought this product would  really stand up to the claims to be a good stiffness.  Had to use nearly half the bottle to achieve some stiffness in my macrame.,3
B001145342,I used tulle in a #4 display for my granddaughter's birthday.  I didn't want it to fall out so I sprayed it. It stiffened and stayed in play! It was perfect!,5
B001145342,Very useful in my craft classes.,5
B001145342,I had a good experience using this product for my macrame ornaments!,5
B001145342,"So it was my first time using this type of product amd I found it easy to use. I was trying to reshape a lamp shade. It works well, I used a form to hold the shape and then sprayed the material.  It goes a long way. Would buy it again.",5
B001145342,Dosent really make fabric super stiff,4
B001145342,It worked for what I needed it for and it doesn't stain the cloth. I use it to make fabric earrings stiff.,5
B001145342,"I used this product to add body on cotton wide-brim hats that soften after washing.  The product itself worked very well, but the sprayer was not adequate.  It took forever to spray the fabric and my hand was exhausted.  Buy a sprayer bottle to use with this product.  I bought the Bcway Plastic Spray Bottle, 16 oz. on Amazon after struggling so much with my first attempt.  The Bcway worked really well and holds two bottles of the product.",5
B001145342,Works well!!!,5
B001145342,"I purchased this to stiffen a large knitted Mandala wall hanging.  It did not work well, even after two painstaking applications.  First, the product sprays out in such a small amount that my hands got sore and tired from having to pump so much.  By the time I got to the outer part of the circle, I could barely press it anymore.  I think this is also because, secondly, the pump is too stiff.  Third, the pump clogs.  I rinsed it out once or twice during use and each time had diminishing returns on effectiveness.  Worst of all, it doesn't really stiffen the knitted fabric very well.  The piece is well taught out on a large loop (40"") so there is plenty of tension to hold the piece in its flat shape.  It's like...slightly crusty?  Maybe?  I think perhaps this product works best on small projects.",2
B001145342,"I had a little disaster. I had the bottle standing upright in my box of tatting supplies. Well, it fell over and most of the bottle leaked everywhere. It had fallen over before (you'd think I'd learn my lesson) so I tightened the lid or whatever it is real good and stood it up again. Somehow the lid loosened and when it fell over it leaked like crazy. Ruined a bunch of yarn and a spool of ribbon I hadn't even opened yet. I had two small items I had made in the bottom of bin that were completely soaked. Who knows how long they'd been in that puddle of stiffener. I took them out and patted out the excess and  laid them flat to dry overnight. This morning the really fine one made from size 20 cotton thread was pretty stiff but still bendable. The one made with size three thread/yarn was really floppy. It looks very nice but not what I would expect after the soaking it got. I'm not sure what the results are really supposed to be like. I have some icicle Christmas ornaments my aunt crocheted many years ago and they are so stiff they hurt when touch the points. That's the result I was expecting.",1
B001145342,"This spray doesn't stiffen well. On top of that, it is extremely difficult to use. I understand and agree with less aerosols, but this spray clogs within 10 sprays making it difficult to spray without cleaning the nozzle, and the nozzle tends to turn with every spray making everything around the item wet, but completely missing the item needing to be stiffened. Probably easier to use a glue and water mixture and ""paint"" it on lol.",2
B001145342,Arrived on time. This is the first time I've used this product. While it drys clear it did not stiffen the macrame angel I made as well as expected.,4
B001145342,"Seems to work well, although I've read some reviews about this turning white cord yellow. I haven't tried it on any thing white yet and don't think I will. All in all it really does exactly what I bought it for.",5
B001145342,Easy to use,5
B001145342,"Not as good as I thought, I was making macrame leaves, I wanted to make them harder",3
B001145342,This product does NOT stiffen anything.  I used it on some yarn to firm up the pieces (butterfly wings) and it did nothing.,1
B001145342,"In order to stiffen well, you need to use even 5-6 times and dry each layer well",4
B001145342,LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BUT OVERALL IT DID THE JOB. I USED THEM FOR HAIR BOWS I MADE FOR MY PUPPY. I STUCK A THICKER PENCIL INSIDE EACH HOOP AND SPRAYED IT TO HOLD ITS SHAPE THEN LEFT OVERNIGHT SPRAYED AGAIN IN THE MORNING AND BY THE EVENING THEY WERE PERFECT. MY PET RUNS AROUND AND AOT AND STILL TEH HAIR BOWS  HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR SHAPE SO FAR. I DO RECOMMEND.,5
B001145342,Worked good for a very large floppy hate I have. It took 4 coats and reshapping.,4
B001145342,"This product leaves no white residue and works in about 30 minutes.  Yes, sometimes it takes longer if you spray heavy.  Yes I would recommend",5
B09GXQYC2G,This is a great  UV resin that is nice and clear . It has very little smell .The cure time was quick . I use a lot of UV resin and will be looking for this in a larger bottle for next time . It cured hard and works well for jewelry .,5
B09GXQYC2G,"Bubble size is small I just use a lighter to get rid of them. If you pout slowly less bubbles. Glue quality not sure what that is. Thickness is good, leakage if you over use what the mold requires will happen. Mix ability is good. And value for money is perfect! I've been resining for a long time. This is a good quality product",5
B09GXQYC2G,"I bought these to seal vinal on keychains and it is really easy to use, it has low odor and it comes with tools and molds, this is great for the price!",4
B09GXQYC2G,"Tested and two surfboard that each had 4 small dings, and it worked out great. Like it better than Solarez as it seems to cure harder than Solarez, has a more precision like tip, and comes in a sizable bottle. Because of the precision like tip can control the amount of resin to use, which make some small ding just one drop to fix, and can put clear tape over the drop to make in smooth let it sit in the direct sunlight for 5 minutes, then pill off the tap. Then let cure in the direct sun another 5 minutes. Then can let sit for a half our then can sand off if needed. Both surfboards are now water tight!",5
B09GXQYC2G,Seems to be ok UV resin. Hardens after 3-4 minutes exposed to UV light. Sunlight cures resin with out need for timer. Flexible non-slick applicator works nicely. Good for touchup on 2 part resins that present voids.,4
B09GXQYC2G,Really love this product,5
B09GXQYC2G,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was my first time using this resin and it did not disappoint! I think it was great and it looked good,5
B09GXQYC2G,"I have tried a few other brands of UV resin and they all end up soft or sticky, no matter how long I cure them. I did some reading and tried different lamps with different wavelengths, but this was the only one that has worked. It's easy to use, low odor, cures nice and hard, and is wonderfully glossy! I love this resin!",5
B09GXQYC2G,The lid leaks liek no other. It's really frustrating. And no matter how long I keep uv on it it stays tacky and come apart when I try to adhere other clean resin together.,3
B09GXQYC2G,"This works pretty good, think I need a stronger uv light though. So far I'm happy with this purchase.",4
B09GXQYC2G,"I like that it came with a couple little molds to try out and stirrer. I tried to put a little turkey tail in resin one of the molds and it looks cute but I dont know how to polish the edges or not have bubbles without spending too much more money. I also took another turkey tail and coated it in this, taking it out to the sun to harden each time. it's a bit difficult, if it drips or anything, that becomes permanent and then you can't undo it. You have to be very careful with how you work with it, it goes from liquid to hard plastic very fast in the sun. you have to pay a lot of attention to the details, make sure it doesnt have air pockets, and then have to protect from pollen and dust blowing into it too. But it was fun to play around with and get a feel for how uv resin works and how it sets.",5
B09GXQYC2G,"When I decided to try my hand at homemade x-ray markers I was overwhelmed with my options for UV resin (since I've got a UV lamp, already) and decided on this one after reading the reviews and it was a good price point.It worked pretty well but maybe my UV lamp is just not especially good because the resin never seemed to fully harden no matter how long I left it under the lamp.My first and only experimental pair of markers seems to be somewhat soft and bendable which is not ideal but I make it work.I used resin pigment drops to colour my resin but wanted a fairly decent amount of translucency so maybe the pigment affected the UV light's ability to penetrate the resin to fully cure? IDK.Either way, not bad. I'll try again someday.",3
B09GXQYC2G,This is a little smelly but cures with one set on light hard as a rock. Never tacky.,4
B09GXQYC2G,"It does what its supposed to do and is easy to use.  But, make no mistake about it, its not glue.  Its a resin as it says.  It does cure quite clear and fairly hard.  I was looking for a glue, though.  That's my only reason for taking a star away.",4
B09GXQYC2G,"This is the first tine I've purchased a product like this, so while I cannot definitively say it's better than any other, it does exactly what I wanted it for. I am a satisfied customer.",5
B09GXQYC2G,I use UV resin now!!!! For years i have been using regular resin and ever since i started using UV. I will never turn back unless i am doing a huge project that requires a lot of resin. But this resin is a life changer. I am able to cut my work productivity by 2 days!. I can finish and ship a few orders the same day. Great invention.,5
B09GXQYC2G,love this product,5
B09GXQYC2G,I use this for small repair work around the house. I recommend it.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"I love this uv resin. I was very ill for months and couldn't do much, but I found I could go into the yard and collect small plants and flowers and put them into tiny jars. I used this resin to make it permanent. Very easy to use. Just pour, set in the sun and it hardens.",5
B09GXQYC2G,"Works great, I used it as glue for one project (perfect for gluing crystals, I made a geode), and as a top coat of sorts on clay sculptures (the caps of mushrooms, I also made them have drips of resin like if they had rain dripping off them:)).Nice and clear (will appear yellow when drying under the UV but once pulled out is completely clear). Hardly any smell.",5
B09GXQYC2G,Perfect for crafting. Made keychains and this was perfect and it cured pretty quick,5
B09GXQYC2G,"Works great, has slight odor, always be safe and use you PPE.  Will buy again",4
B09GXQYC2G,"It doesbt cure as fast or as hard as solarez,  but the bottle is nice, it does cure fully, and it certainly works.  Do spend a little money and invest in a good u.v. light however.",4
B09GXQYC2G,"This is the best UV resin I've ever used and I'm so glad I bought it! I was worried that it would cure tacky like the previous brands I've purchased, but this one is perfect!I should probably add that it's not great with paint, so you should probably go over your painted piece with a sealant first before directly applying the resin. It made my acrylic paint smudge so bad. It works great on alcohol markers and colored pencils though!I let it sit under my nail lamp for 2-4 minutes and even on an opaque surface, it cures quickly and neatly! It begins curing in seconds, but I'd recommend leaving it for the full 4 minutes just to be sure.What's more is that there's almost no odor! Although I'd recommend wearing a respirator, I didn't when I used it, I didn't get a headache even after working with it for 4 hours. Definitely still use gloves though!I totally recommend this product and I will absolutely be buying it again!",5
B09GXQYC2G,I only used the product a few times to make keychains.  Very happy with it.  Not sure how often I will use as I just wanted to make a few keychains.,5
B09GXQYC2G,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This cures fast and gives me the effect I want for my model kit.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"It's so much faster and clearer than any other UV resin i've used. Those can take 30min-1hr, this? 5 minutes. I used it for multiple things but my favorite is to seal my painted rock of mothfrog",5
B09GXQYC2G,"I'm an amateur so the resin pieces I made didn't come out exactly how I wanted, that and I use a liquid dye (probably better to use powder dye, like Mika), but it is I feel like better for beginners in comparison to epoxy resin, as it goes a lot quicker to dry and gets hardened a lot quicker so it's easy to tell when it's cured, that and even if left in the sun (smaller peices) it doesn't even take too long at it's perfect since I can get other things done while waiting.",5
B09GXQYC2G,"Easy to use this item, my daughter's favourite activity. She got it at the age of 8, and she can make her own necklaces.",5
B09GXQYC2G,I used it to set my bookmarks. It was fast and easy too use. The needle like tip was easy to put where I need the resin. Will definitely get again,5
B09GXQYC2G,"I bought this to seal shrinky dinks designs so they don't rub off with use. Works perfectly without smudging the design, cures very well and evenly with a UV light, and stays clear and shiny.",5
B09GXQYC2G,Easy to use just make sure you have a mat under your craft wear your protective gear gloves mask it dries quickly under the UV light,4
B09GXQYC2G,Works great for my small jewelry and miniverse projects.  Cures well with my nail light.,5
B09GXQYC2G,The tip on the bottle and the utensils provided make this resin very easy to apply. It's my first time ever working with resin and I'm using this to face some keychains that arrived scratched. It's easy to apply and I can spread it out evenly with the spatula end of the tool. It cured in about 3-4 minutes in my UV lamp that I use for nails.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"I have used this product multiple times with great results. It works exactly as advertised.However, on this order I received a box that appears that it has been open before and both bottles are unsealed and leaking. I usually use this promptly once it is opened and I have concerns about the quality of this product since it has been open for unknown period of time.",3
B09GXQYC2G,"I have used several kinds of UV resin for my glass mosaic and botany pendants.  Nothing works as good as this brand. Cures very fast and not tacky. Very clear. I have pendants that are now several years old and they have not yellowed.  However, it is important to note that if you have been using a bottle for a while and it begins to remain tacky after the normal cure time under UV light, it has likely been on the shelf too long.  After a couple of years, you need to replace it with a new bottle. It does have a certain shelf-life.",5
B09GXQYC2G,Good product. Used with Make it Mini products where the resin that came with the toy spilled out in the mail. Worked great for mini fish in a tank.,5
B09GXQYC2G,For smaller project this resin is great. Easy curable under UV lighting. Supper clear resin. No mixing required.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"This is the 1st UV Resin I've ever used. Bubbles are easy to get out and the pieces are beautiful when finshed. Very glossy. This resin comes out thick and slow, making it easy for newbie to control. I really like this resin.",5
B09GXQYC2G,I like the resin and the mold that comes with the bundle. The stirring tool is a bit soft and I haven't used it because of that.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"My first time with this brand and I'm pretty pleased with it. It's easy to use, spreads easily and cures fully with no tackiness left behind. I will be purchasing again.",5
B09GXQYC2G,Works just like regular resin. Great for small projects. Best price and value,5
B09GXQYC2G,I didn't use it.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"Super clear, hard. Dries fast with UV in natural light it gives you time to move things. I've been using for diorama building and even under intense light it shows up clear. I just started using it as my projects age both indoor and out if it begins to discolor or release I will update this review",5
B09GXQYC2G,Bought this UV resin to fix my teeth not a good idea but didn't cause me any harm it just doesn't stay very long on your teeth but when I made some crafts it came out very well and it dried very well and it dried clear which isn't it's a very good quality resin UV resin definitely love this purchase,5
B09GXQYC2G,I love this product. It's my first time using it. I didn't realize how messy it could get BUT it works well. I would definitely or this again in a large size.,5
B09GXQYC2G,This works great with my keychains I made,5
B09GXQYC2G,"It is good to work with, give me the result I want clear, like a glass . And I love it!",5
B09GXQYC2G,"The resin worked for what I needed it for, but when I took the safety seal off before using, I realized the bottle was only half full. I recommend customers check the bottle before using.",3
B09GXQYC2G,granddaughters,5
B09GXQYC2G,I tried to use a light I purchased for curing Gel Nail Polish but it was too weak to cure this with just the recommended time. I had to cure multiple times before I got the stickiness to go away (not the resin's fault). It does scratch pretty easy but I think that's just how most resin is. Would buy again,4
B09GXQYC2G,This resin does work. I have tried high end UV resin ( Sophie and Tophie ) and there UV resin can not seem to cure in my basement without yellowing and still being tacky no matter how long it stays under my UV lamp. I have used this brand  in my basement ( It was the first one I ever tried ) that is always cold hit it with a UV lamp 6 times ( 99 second intervals at 54w on top and bottom of a white opaque mold) and it was completely cured. Very few bubble ( The ones that were on the surface I hit with a heat gun before curing because I mixed with some pigment ) Dries clear and hard like glass. Also for the price you can't beat it. Way less than other brands and it does work.,5
B09GXQYC2G,This advesive is easy to use and will stay in a semi liquid form until ultraviolet light shines on it.  Use one of the ultraviolt flash lights for work away from the sun.,5
B09GXQYC2G,Dries fast with UV light,4
B09GXQYC2G,If you're impatient this is the resin for you with uv light about an hour for cure time but for best results leave near a window were the sun hits best!! It works wonders,5
B09GXQYC2G,Works very well. It is pretty thick. I have seen some where they are too watery but this one works perfectly.,5
B09GXQYC2G,"I have used several different types of UV resin and this is the absolute best I have ever used. The price was right.  I just received it but can tell you it dries clear and hard. There is no smell, and it is not tacky at all when dry. Smooth and crystal clear. Edges clip off easily with only a file. It is perfect",5
B09GXQYC2G,Works just like it should easy to use,5
B09GXQYC2G,It works great one day then takes forever to firm up the next day. I use the same lamp all the time.,4
B09GXQYC2G,I use this to secure the thred on my hand tie crappie jigs. Hardens every well and lasts the lifetime of my jigs.,5
B09GXQYC2G,Worked great. I was not sure what to expect but I was impressed.  This UV resin hardens under sunlight or using UV light per the instructions.  Low odor and quick work times. My only nag is I wish there was a thinner applicator included.,5
B09GXQYC2G,I love this UV resin! I put the uv resin under the sun and it actually cured!! It works great!,5
B09GXQYC2G,I love this brand so much more than the previous brands and it has a lower viscosities so it doesn't come spewing out of the bottle,5
B09GXQYC2G,Funciona perfecto!,5
B09GXQYC2G,I like using this resin no mixing it's comes out clear it doesn't take long to dry,4
B09GXQYC2G,I used mine for earrings it worked fine. But it's tinted a bit yellowish now? So I'm going to look for a different type.. I'm sure it's fine for your fingernails..I may have left mine in the light too long?,4
B09GXQYC2G,Works VERY well! Love this and will buy again!,5
B09GXQYC2G,Buying more before it's gone or changed to a different name.  Hardens quick and even and stays fluid until it is put under the light.,5
B09GXQYC2G,Does the job,5
B07PM3XRXY,I'm making candles as holiday gifts for friends and family and this a wonderful set.I really like how there are 3 sizes and are easy to work with.The candles burn clean and look great.I recommend.Thanks.,5
B07PM3XRXY,wife does candles as a hobby these are great and worked well she liked them wanted more well worth the money,5
B07PM3XRXY,great to use,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Thin for smaller candles, lowers wax melt temps and perfect for adding two or more  wicks to larger candle due to light, small wick flame. I advise using other wick stickers, or hot glue the wicks to the bottom, the adhesive on the ones that come in this set do not stick at all as many others have complained and are also thick foam compared to other successful wick stickers. Once you pour in the wax they become loose a float around which is dangerous if burnt without a stable wick. Have fun enjoy your candle making!",4
B07PM3XRXY,"I just made candles yesterday using these candle wicks. They last a long time as well as perfect lengths and three varieties. I do have to say like almost all wicks when the hot candle wax goes in the jar it unsticks and floats around, but that happens. Also, they give you lots of wicks but not enough stickies for the bottom of the wick to stick to the candle jar. overall this is all fixable and for the type of coated wick and long-lasting and variety and amount overall I believe it is worth the price for this product.",5
B07PM3XRXY,"I've only ever used 1 size wick, and had to cut off excess for waste. I'm glad to have a bunch of options now",5
B07PM3XRXY,"Being new to candle making, I am still learning about wick sizes and wicking up. The length is given for each, but not the size, eg CD 12, 14, etc.  My candles are tunneling because the packaging doesn't say the size.",3
B07PM3XRXY,Great for making candles,4
B07PM3XRXY,"candle wicks, awesome worked great",5
B07PM3XRXY,The variety of the wicks are great quality. However the stickers were sticking to the box and were peeling off the sheet. I like the wooden sticks and they work very well.,4
B07PM3XRXY,Easy to use wicks. Burning is appropriate. Last for hours. Priced great,5
B07PM3XRXY,Buenas traen bastante el.paquete,5
B07PM3XRXY,very good,5
B07PM3XRXY,I love the different sizes it comes with for all the different candles I've made. The wick stability is great along with the burn quality. It's easy to use and perfect for home DIY candle projects.,5
B07PM3XRXY,Ok,5
B07PM3XRXY,Helpful,5
B07PM3XRXY,Good wics they are stiff unlike other ones as a candle wic should be and they don't break off the metal bottom piece I would recommend them,5
B07PM3XRXY,They work good,4
B07PM3XRXY,"No complaints thus far,  hopefully there won't be nome",5
B07PM3XRXY,These are easy to use  very versatile and the quality is awesome  They are true to size they work well and no smoke smell  will order again,5
B07PM3XRXY,"First of all, the stickers to hold them to the container base are useless.  The instant the wax hits them the whole thing pops up and floats.Second half of them had the wax around the wick cracked and/or broken so they were not straight up from the metal base.  I had to attempt to keep a couple of them straight until the wax hardened enough that the holder kept them upright.  Others just ended up sliding diagonal in the candles and I gave up trying to make them straight.  Luckily I started with tea candles so the off centeredness won't be a serious problem.Finally, it only comes with 1 setter. . .with 300 wicks?!?!  That ended up being a bigger problem than expected with the wicks not standing up properly.Honestly, I was disappointed.  I was able to make the tea candles, but with more effort on my part than I would have liked.  I'd have had better luck using hot glue or something to hold the wicks down and chopsticks to keep them upright.",3
B07PM3XRXY,Very useful.,5
B07PM3XRXY,"The soy wax I used calls for heating to 160 degrees, then pouring right away. These wick stickers released from the wick tab as soon as I poured the wax. Perhaps they may hold better at a lower temp, but I am probably not going to be able to use these and now must buy different ones. I suppose if you're going to pour your wax at a lower temp, they may hold better, but if I were doing this over, I'd just spend the money for better quality.",3
B07PM3XRXY,Very high quality and works very well in my candle making endeavors.,5
B07PM3XRXY,"I found it odd that these wicks are ""general"" and lacking in any size when wick size is so essential in the making and burning of various sized candles.  I had to do lots of research to find this out then realized I may have made my time consuming candles with an inappropriate wick for my size of candle.  Could it have been the reason my candle pooled?  Not sure.  Lesson learned to purchase the correct size wicks (not length) but density for the candle.  Hint: look for a wick guide to determine which wick you will need.  Free on wax websites.",3
B07PM3XRXY,I love  making my own scented candles and the wicks are very easy to use,5
B07PM3XRXY,Las pegatinas no son buenas pero las mechas son excelentes,4
B07PM3XRXY,"Purchased these last year and have tried several times to make candles.  No matter the size of the candle or amount of wicks used they always tunnel and burn out. Looking through other reviews it's good to know it's the product and not me as so many had the same issue.  Stuck with a ton of bad wicks, don't bother purchasing.",1
B07PM3XRXY,These work great,5
B07PM3XRXY,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I used the shortest sized wick in a hand poured votive.  It was more than long enough, I actually had extra to trim down.  It was sturdy and unbroken.  It set nicely and it is burning evenly and brightly.  No smoke.  I am happy with this product.",5
B07PM3XRXY,This product is just what I wanted. Quality good,4
B07PM3XRXY,"I made three candles in three different size candle jars using the same soy wax. All three did not burn properly. The wicks do not last as long as the wax I used. Resulting in useless candles. Would not purchase again.Pic is of my third and last attempt. I figured the tall narrow jar would help melt the wax evenly. (Last winter, I noticed that the cold weather contributed to wax not burning properly in wider jars since the cold glass doesn't allow the wax to melt resulting in the candle only burning straight down with a lot of wasted wax along the side.)Well it's the summertime I tried it in the narrow jar and it still didn't work. They do not work with soy in my experience.",1
B07PM3XRXY,Easy to use it,5
B07PM3XRXY,There were plenty of all sizes. We make candle 2-3 times a year and these work well,5
B07PM3XRXY,These are great. The stickers that come with it do move at times so additional glue or adhesive may be needed.,5
B07PM3XRXY,For some reason they keep on popping off and floating around!! The stickies stick well but hate how they always POP off :(  i even wait a bit for the wax to cool off and they still pop off,2
B07PM3XRXY,Love it,5
B07PM3XRXY,My mom made candles with these.,5
B07PM3XRXY,I appreciated the different lengths of wicks to choose from. The stickers though did NOT stick. As soon as the wax was poured the bottom would lift up and float away. So I have to figure out how to fix that because it makes the process more annoying.,3
B07PM3XRXY,These didn't not work well for me. Not sure if it's the type of wax I'm using but they made my candles tunnel burn. Easy to place on/in your jar.,3
B07PM3XRXY,,3
B07PM3XRXY,Purchased item received as expected.,5
B07PM3XRXY,Great product for the price. Many different wick sizes. The sticker helps keep the wick in place.,5
B07PM3XRXY,"I wish it came with more than one metal setter, you have to long toDo more than one at a time. But good for beginners",4
B07PM3XRXY,"This may be a problem common in these products, but I thought I'd mention it for those who (like me) don't use these super often. The sticky pad for attaching the wick to the bottom of the container WILL detach if too much hot wax is poured over it (I assume the heat impacts the adhesive). Easily solved, though- just add a little bit of wax at the beginning to cover the bottom and let it harden some before adding more.",4
B07PM3XRXY,I was very pleased,5
B07PM3XRXY,Needed a lot of different wicks for my handmade candles and this bundle did the trick. The wicks burn perfectly and I have not had any complaints from customers. Definitely recommend these.,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Not pleased, wicks burn too quickly, leaving candle wax too high , messed up.",1
B07PM3XRXY,Had it for years and make my own candles,4
B07PM3XRXY,Well madr and great value,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Not very happy with this product. I tried using their wick stickers with a handful of my mason jar candles and the stickers wouldn't stay in place when I poured the wax. Disappointed in the stickers. The wicks are fine, so not a complete loss.",3
B07PM3XRXY,"I saw that these wicks had 4.5 stars and were Amazon's choice and said, hey these are perfect and cheap! So, I began using them in a bunch of my candles, I stupidly didn't test any of them until a few days ago... and yep they are absolutely useless. I've now wasted over $50 on candle-making supplies because I used faulty wicks in my candles. It's unfortunate because I have just launched my small business and now this, which is a huge setback. Please, don't buy!",1
B07PM3XRXY,These are great. Will be ordering again.,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Fast shipping, quality product at a great price.",5
B07PM3XRXY,I used this product to make citronella candles to repel mosquitoes. It works great.,5
B07PM3XRXY,This is 8 ounce jar with 2 of the middle wicks worked full pool in 1 hour and a half. Beautifully.,5
B07PM3XRXY,This product was excellent and I think that they even included extra wicks! Great for the candles and the stickers worked good to keep the wick in place.,5
B07PM3XRXY,Nice wick so far but I use multiple wicks for my 3 in diameter candles however I had a mess on my hands with the stickers not holding & my wicks were floating. Make sure you have some other stickers on hand that hold better or use your glue gun which is going to be a pain,3
B07PM3XRXY,You get your money's worth the wax coating on the wicks or evenly distributed very awesome product,5
B07PM3XRXY,These sizes are great for all size candle holders,5
B07PM3XRXY,Love it . They work so well made so many candles out of them.,5
B07PM3XRXY,They work okay,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Good selection of wick lengths, plenty of holders and securement tabs to make a lot of candles! Enjoy!",5
B07PM3XRXY,The stickers won't stay on the metal wick or the bottom.,4
B07PM3XRXY,exactly what was described!,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Great value, the assortments of the wick size are amazing and good quality.Perfect for DIY candle making projects, will be purchased again when needed.",5
B07PM3XRXY,This included everything as depicted. I'm pretty happy with this purchase. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is the fact that the wicks are a little thin. They still work very well. They just seem like they would break easily if dropped.,4
B07PM3XRXY,Haven't received sjand.,5
B07PM3XRXY,Everything is good.,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Me encantaron, la pega es muy resistentes y las mechas son muy buenas.",5
B07PM3XRXY,"Loved these wicks. Paid a great price for them. The pack came with some foam stickers which are about dime size; that part didnt make much sense, not to mention, there are only a handful of them (maybe 40ish?) I cut mine smaller to place the wicks and they worked perfectly. Used with beeswax candles. No smoke, burned lovely (cut the wick real close)  I'd recommend :)",5
B07PM3XRXY,Supplemental supplies are purchased for repair of eventual emergencies. I prefer to have extra on hand and also for use in crafting.. The material is well put together and inn good shape at delivery.,3
B07PM3XRXY,I am making my own candles and saving money. Easy to use.,5
B07PM3XRXY,I love the sizes,5
B07PM3XRXY,"This particular wick does not self trim you must trim the wick I have a small 4 oz jar with a 2 1/2 diameter and once it gets a decent melt pool it'll start to flicker and have a mushroom top, .  Probably good with different waxes I use a paraffin blend I'm trying out a different wick beginner candle making person.",3
B07PM3XRXY,I was it my mail box .Thank you,5
B07PM3XRXY,"The only thing I liked was they came in 3 different sizes.  However, I have tried to place 4 wicks in 4 different candles and none of them worked. I'm just wasting them because they keep coming loose and once the wax is on them there is no way they will stick. They won't stick before I pour the wax in the jar..waste don't buy the tape is extremely cheap.  Wish I had read a review b4 I purchased.",2
B07PM3XRXY,n/a,5
B07PM3XRXY,Good quality,5
B07PM3XRXY,Our package  was missing the centering device. That would have made it easier. Not worth the hassle of returning and getting a replacement but it would have been nice if it was included.,4
B07PM3XRXY,This is perfect for building my inventory for different size candles,5
B07PM3XRXY,much cheaper than buying at store!,5
B07PM3XRXY,"Burns up way to fast that the candle does not get used by the wicks. I even took three of them and braided them together to see if that made it any better however, it did not help... Unfortuneately, I cannot recommend.",2
B07PM3XRXY,Very well packaged in a sturdy box! I was well pleased!,5
B07PM3XRXY,Good I recommend,5

B0076FJ7SS,"It was confusing trying to decide which corner cutter to purchase because there are so many to select from. This one works great and I am glad I bought it. I needed one to cut corners on 80 lb. card stock with 3mm laminate on both sides, and it works like a charm. Super easy to use and produces clean, consistent cuts on each pass. Well made, too!",5
B0076FJ7SS,This corner cutter works so well! It creates clean rounded edges and having three sizing options is awesome! It's pretty compact too so easy to throw into a craft box without taking up much space. Super happy with this purchase!,5
B0076FJ7SS,Cuts in three different sizes with sharp consistent corners. This product is also aesthetically pleasing and made with high quality materials.,5
B0076FJ7SS,I have owed several different types of corner rounders including named branded ones! They all would partially cut and round the corner leaving rough edges. This ones cuts perfectly and leaves smooth rounded corners on laminated pages. Definitely worth the money!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"With one press, cleanly shears the sharp corners off of laminates. Three cutter sizes in this tool. I'd recommend practicing with a piece of scrap laminate to get a feel for it, know what the size options are. If you make a mistake with laminates and need to re-do, it can be difficult and sometimes impossible to remove what you've laminated without damaging it.My favorite use is for wallet sized cards. I carry in a cloth wallet and use 5mil laminate. Potentially damaging to the wallet without rounding the corners. The corners can catch on the interior of the wallet. You can also stab/cut yourself on the corners when reaching in to pull the cards out.Bottom line, must-have tool. Free-handing corner rounding with scissors isn't easy to do well and cleanly.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"The small opening is almost the perfect size if you make your own MTG Proxys. Actual cards have 3mm corners and all corner rounders you can buy at craft stores only go down to 4mm and it is noticeable. The small opening is 3mm and while its not exactly replicated due to the spring tension on the cutting edge, it's unrecognizable. It's a minor detail, but for us detail oriented types it's huge.",5
B0076FJ7SS,This is handy and works well.  I bought it to make hand made greeting cards.  I'm happy I bought it.,5
B0076FJ7SS,"Just got this about 3/4 months ago.  Had another for about 12 years+ that died.  This one is attractive and very effective.  Sits solidly on desktop.  I sometimes corner paper or cardstock just because I don't like dog ears or crimped corners, or it helps to put a card into a sleeve in my wallet.  If you're one to create your own greeting cards, the cornering makes a nice finish.",5
B0076FJ7SS,The punch does a good job of rounding corners.  I got it to make playing cards for some game designs I was working on.  It can sometimes be difficult to press since the top part is plastic.  I'm worried I'll break the top lever on thicker paper.  But it has held up thus far and I've made hundreds of cards.  I'd get it again for the price.,4
B0076FJ7SS,Love this!! Dual functions lightweight!! Perfect for paper crafting,5
B0076FJ7SS,"Instead of the boring old 4-7-10 configuration, this gem comes with an arguably more useful 3-5-8 configuration. Plus it won't leave the trimmings all over the place like some of the others. Wonderful tactile feedback through the whole cutting experience. 12/10 would cut corners with it again.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"So easy to use! Instead of paying for rounded corners from card makers (Shutterfly & Canva), I saved money by rounding the corners of my bachelorette and wedding invites myself. No issues using this product even with thick cardstock paper.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"In initial test, it works perfectly.",4
B0076FJ7SS,Cutting corners proudly now,5
B0076FJ7SS,"Found out about this item from YT video and explained how she went threw several punches before this item. This one is sturdy, compact and sleek. I would definitely buy again if needed.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"It's durable, light weight, and easy to use for it's size. Unlike other corner punchers!",5
B0076FJ7SS,Easy to use and very sharp. I have weak hands so I was worried but it's very nice.,5
B0076FJ7SS,Have had multiple corner rounders and this one has been the best by far. Works perfectly on many different thickness of paper. Recommend!!,5
B0076FJ7SS,It works really well. It was able to cut through 3mil and 5mil lamination easily. It struggles a bit with 10mil but still works. I have a small business and have used this over 100 times.,5
B0076FJ7SS,Easily punches through 10 mil laminate. I have arthritis in my hands and this punch has been awesome for me.,5
B0076FJ7SS,"This Corner Cutter works pretty well when cutting paper products.  It is very sharp, so I think it would work on lighter weight laminated documents, too.  Unfortunately for me, I bought it to round the corners of strips of kinesiology tape, and it does not do that very well at all.  But that is something of an ""off label"" application.  It trims paper very well, provided you insert the corner of the piece to be trimmed correctly.",4
B0076FJ7SS,"Who knew you needed this?  I saw a creator use it online and thought ""fun!""  I like to design and print my own cards, notes, and gift tags.  You'd be surprised how much nicer a card, note, gift tag, or whatever looks with neat, even, rounded corners.  This thing is very heavy and solid and looks to be able to go for a long time.  love it!  Off to design some business cards...",5
B0076FJ7SS,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought small Mylar bags, and they came with really pointy corners. This little device was the solution!",5
B0076FJ7SS,"I've had several corner rounder cutters but lining them up on the paper always has to be so exact.  Otherwise, they cut more than the corners.  I tried this one right away and the corners are perfect.  Just stick the paper in the desired corner size, and it makes a perfect round cut every time.  No more fuss!",5
B0076FJ7SS,I bought this to punch corners on 5 mm laminate and it works good.  Better than the cheaper one I previously bought.,5
B0076FJ7SS,My wife purchased one for her classroom and loved it. She loved it so much she got one for the house. I used it at the house and bought one for my work. We use it for both paper as well as laminated sheets. It works great for pretty much everything. It's nice that it has 3 different sizes as well. Highly recommend!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"I had to get this after I purchased another model that couldn't cut the card stock I had to trim.  I wanted to soften the edges from each of the four corners. This has three corner possibilities, from small to medium to large. However, the big draw for me was to go thru a 5mm laminated card that I had done for nearly 100 name tags. This cut them perfectly like a boss, with no difficulties and no need to push more than a regular hole or corner punch. I didn't even feel any difference when cutting a single sheet of paper vs cutting the 5mm laminated card stock. Love this corner punch!",5
B0076FJ7SS,I have three of these there inexpensive comfortable on the hand and work very well,5
B0076FJ7SS,I have only used it a few times on playing cards for corner rounding and it works OK. Sometimes I have to repeat the process. The Medium and Large settings work best.,3
B0076FJ7SS,"I play a lot of Tabletop RPGs, hoard PDFs, and have recently starting printing my own booklets / zines. I found this product [New Sunstar Kadomaru Pro, Corner Cutter (S4765036) (Kadomaru Pro)] as a recommendation from a random forum post. It feels sturdy enough, though I'm careful with how hard I press because I also feel like I could easily snap the push 'lever'.I've been printing on Hammermill 24lb premium inkjet & laser paper. This product will only cut 3 pages at a time. 4 or more and it won't actually cut through, just make a deep indent. Even if I press down a few times, it won't ever make it through and cut.I'm about to print a few booklets on Hammermill 32lb premium color copy paper and I suspect this will only cut 2 pages at a time.I don't know what alternatives exist as nothing I found referenced paper thickness/weight, but this gets the job done even if it's tedious for lager zines. Either way, it cuts cleanly and is dead simple to use.",4
B0076FJ7SS,great would buy again,5
B0076FJ7SS,I use this in my classroom to trips corners when I laminate things. It is especially nice when the things I laminate are handled by kids. No one pokes themselves with the sharp corners.,5
B0076FJ7SS,This really is a great handheld corner cutter.  I've used it a lot on my scrapbook pages & cards.  Works great!!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"did not work for me. tried to use it on a slightly thicker paper, it did not cut the first press, then when it does on second or third press, it leaves the edges fizzeled. not good being x2 the money of all others. rev ised from 2 to 3, as based on reviews of all others, they are all the same. will just keep it. I still think if I am have a do over, I would buy others for less than the price. not worth the time of a return for me.",3
B0076FJ7SS,"Originally I provided a 4 star review for this, but after having it over a year and it seeing heavy use, I'm updating to 5 stars.  It's a bit loud when using, which I did not like after cutting hundreds of corners.  After a year of almost daily use, this corner cutter still cuts true every time.  It's outlasted any other hand-held corner rounder I've used.  Highly recommend this.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"This unit is small and sturdy and is part of my HP Sprocket printer ensemble. It has three different radii. I choose the radii (S, M, L) based on the content of the picture and how the picture fills the frame. The photos are also ""stickies"" and the rounded corners help the sticker not to peel. Additionally, they slide into sleeves in photo-books easier. The unit is easy to use and easy to clean. And the bottom, where the detritus is stored, holds tight. It has never popped off accidentally. And it makes a satisfying ""click"" so you know it has done the job. I have bought at least five of these over the years (given away or gifted) and they are all still working (as far as I know).",5
B0076FJ7SS,"Whoever invented the corner cutter is a genius. This very practical tool has served very well so far. As a kindergarten teacher, I'm constantly laminating items for classroom use. These cutters round off the corners so my littles don't poke themselves on the sharp corners of cut-to-fit laminated items. Worth every penny!",5
B0076FJ7SS,"I bought this to make some custom playing cards as a gift. This was easy to use, and made quick work of the double thick card stock I was using. Would recommend.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"Aren't all corner rounders made alike? Nope, not by a long shot. The other brands don't leave enough space to let the chads fall out. Why is this a big deal? Because you rarely only cut one corner at a go, you usually cut four corners, and as you cut the extra cut-off pieces stack up, jamming the 3rd or 4th cut, resulting in jagged edges, why too often for my liking. Cutting four corners without having to turn it over, shake it, clear the way, should be a given for a corner rounder tool. This one seems to be doing the trick, I hope it continues to be my champion.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"I really like it.  Sizes are; 1/8"", 3/16"" & 5/16"".  Works very well on heavy paper and laminate.  (Not 'countertop' laminate, 'Thermal Laminating Pouches').",5
B0076FJ7SS,This might work well for paper but wasn't great for 10mm laminates.  I expected I might be asking too much.  I could only get it to round the laminate using the smallest cutter.  I tried the middle size and was afraid it might break the handle so I didn't push too hard.To be fair it probably isn't really meant for thick laminates so I still give it 4 stars.I purchased https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLNX84HS?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details (Lnrueg Corner Rounder) for laminates and it works great for my needs.  Quite a bit more money but worth it for thick laminates,4
B0076FJ7SS,I use this so much and I have carpel tunnel and this one helps so much!!!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"I haven't used it extensively yet so only time will tell about longevity, but so far all 3 corners punch perfectly and easily. Even punches through 65lb stock with a 5mil laminate with no problem.",5
B0076FJ7SS,I have been using it for at least a year to cut the edges of my business cards. I try to do it one at a time and it works perfectly. It's sharp it doesn't leave any remainder after cutting the paper,5
B0076FJ7SS,"This corner cutter is great for sticker paper, and even took on some laminated cardstock. It worked very well on all these fronts and cut through very well. Sometimes it would not cut all the way through but if I put the paper through it one or two more times it would clean up the cut.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"How difficult can it be to find a decent corner rounder, right?!  Apparently, it is REALLY difficult, cuz I tried at least 8 or 9 at various sizes & hated them all! - including the big huge heavy duty chompers from WeRMemory Keepers.  They are either (1) not quite straight, leaving the rounded corner lopsided (2) they require you to turn the darn thing upside down to see what you are doing in order to line up the punch, then the paper still slips when you actually execute the punch, (3) they are so tight that it takes all my considerable weight to punch a corner, knocking it askew & resulting in a crooked corner, (4) they break after a too few punches, (5) they are super heavy to heft and store, (6) they stop dialing sizes properly,  etc. etc. etc. THEN, this one finally shows up as a #1 seller.  It is GREAT!  First of all, the corners are the sizes I need - the small is about the same radius as you'd see on laminated IDs (I've since gone on a rampage, cleaning out my entire family's wallet & laminating everything & rounding corners on everything), the medium is the perfect size for rounding corners on photos or card envelopes (I think the one on the envelope punch boards are a bit too large to allow you to make a pretty liner or punch a cute little design in the corner) - see the pix I uploaded for an example, the large is perfect for rounding card corners without eating up too much of the design.  I wanted to get through my holiday cards before leaving a review, so that I can indicate what it works on consistently. It works well on paper, cardstock (I tried 65# to 140# watercolor paper), foil cardstock, foam, glitter stock, 40# vellum, and even some card corners that have stenciled texture paste. I didn't like how it worked on felt, since the cuts weren't as clean.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"got this today and tried it.  I like that it has an enclosed cap to catch the clippings.  Also each corner seems to cut pretty good on think paper, thick paper, laminating plastics.  The only thing is that a 10mm larger corner may be more useful, as the 3mm and 5mm seems to not have too much of a difference.",4
B0076FJ7SS,"I have found previous corner cutters I have purchased from the craft store do not work well trimming laminated sheets.  This one works great!  Sometimes it still leaves a little knurdle that needs to be picked off, but the cut is neat and clean.  It costs a little more, but it's worth it because it does the job.  This is a recent purchase, so I cannot speak as to its durability.",4
B0076FJ7SS,It cuts well through 3mm lamination.,5
B0076FJ7SS,"When I placed the order for this corner-rounder, I wasn't too confident that I wouldn't just be throwing away more money.  I had purchased one of the blue square-shaped rounders from a different brand about a week prior and it was absolutely horrible on laminated corners, creating only jagged edges and incomplete cuts.  Seeing how I would be needing to round a lot of corners, I ordered this in a last-ditch effort to avoid cutting them all by hand... and I was not disappointed!This device reliably creates clean corner-rounds on laminated sheets and even has a little catcher for the scrap (which is useful for containing all those tiny sharp corner pieces you cut off)!  When I cut the first corner, I was impressed - but also still waiting for my hopes to be quickly dashed.  Then I cut several more corners and they, too, came out perfect on the first cut!  Wish I would have spent the extra few dollars on this one the first time around!",5
B0076FJ7SS,"As I stated in the headline, I bought this Oct 11, 2019 and has worked perfectly for almost 5 years.  I used it every crafting day--multiple times per day with NO PROBLEMS until this morning, I picked it up to cut the 4 corners of a journal card and it FELL APART in my hands!!  Guess after almost 5 years of great service I can't complain.  Just ordered a replacement--hope it lasts 5 years too!!  TYVM for a top-of-the-line product.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"My first reaction was to try to spin the bottom to select what diameter I wanted my rounded corners but this is a totally stationary punch. It's such sharp blades and cuts the corners of cardstock with clean lines. I love how sturdy it feels and was an affordable alternative to paying extra for rounded invitations. The radius of the corners is just labeled ""S"" ""M"" and ""L"", so I had to jump back to the product page to see actual dimensions but I would buy it again in a heartbeat",5
B0076FJ7SS,"This corner punch is such a great desk top tool for the card crafter.  Space is limited on my desk, so I am choosy about what gets to stay out vs what has to be stored away if not in use.  I have had a few corner rounder punches in the past. My most recent is a handled corner punch that is new, but just isn't cutting more than a sliver of the corner off.I am going to help out as a vendor at a local school fundraiser making hand crafted greeting cards.  So I purchased this punch because it has 3 sizes in 1 tool, no dials, no bulky handles, and catches the paper dots.It came in brand new packaging, in timely fashion, and although it doesn't have much heft, the punch is well made.As for use, single sheets of 110 lb card stock, and 140 lb watercolor cold press paper are no problem.  However I almost gave this product a 4 star rating because it took some time to get the appropriate hand position for it to work smoothly for 2 sheets of cardstock.  Now I can manage it fairly well, and have made about 100 cards, 2 to 3 paper layers each. Haven't made a card without rounder corners since it arrived!  No mess, versatile, fits nicely in my palm, compact, still cutting sharply after repeated use, and great value.  Get it if you are in need of nice round corners on your card layers or photos at your work space or on the go, and appreciate a well made tool for a reasonable price.  I will get another if I ever need to replace this, for sure.  Would also make a nice stocking stuffer for anyone into paper craftcrafting.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"This thing is fantastic!  Buy it.Pros:- Provides very professional cuts on photo paper, construction paper and card stock.- Has a template right on top of the cutter to see exactly what the cut will be and to help match cuts of other products.- Paper guide is very easy to use and firmly holds paper still for cutting.  There's no question of whether the sheet is placed correctly.  It sits firmly in the guide slot.- Super simple and fun to use.Cons:- I can't seem to get it to cut just one piece of regular paper.  It's just too thin.- Took a little extra effort to cut through a laminated piece of paper, but that might be because the paper was commercially laminated and VERY thick.  I think it'd be fine with most laminates out there and it *did* work for the piece I had, it just took a little extra oomph.- Can only cut one piece at a time.  Can be time consuming for some projects like a deck of cards.Final Thoughts:I LOVE this thing.  I originally bought it to finish off some fan-made decks of cards I had printed out on card stock for some of my board games.  Doing the four corners on each card is a little time consuming but the cards look so good when they're done, it doesn't even matter.  It was also nice to have the template on top to match a couple of other game card stock items I had previously printed out so they matched the original designs perfectly.  This thing is fantastic for my needs and I could see how it would be a dream tool for anybody out there who scrapbooks or just wants to nicely finish off photos.  Great product.",5
B0076FJ7SS,I love making sure little things for people and adding little details to my packaging so this is super fun to give those extra details. Love the multiple different sizes.,5
B0076FJ7SS,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is the perfect tool for crafters, creators, and anyone looking for smooth consistent rounded edges and corners!It has three sizes to choose from, and can fit pieces pretty small into the wedge before you aren't able to keep a good grip on it. The large handle allows for long time use without cramps, soreness and fatigue.My favorite is the no mess bottom which is a snap on tray that collects your scraps and trimmings so you don't have to hold it over a trash can or bin yourself.I'll never go back to scissors (unless the papers is too thick which really, I haven't found any that it hasn't been able to cut clean through) because you can't always get a smooth even trim like you can with hell from this little gadget!",5
B0076FJ7SS,"This product works very well, easy to use, and easy to punch!",5
B0076FJ7SS,"Works pretty well - leaves a slight deboss/emboss at edge of radius on your paper where it pinches/holds it.This was obesrved on #110 lb cardstock. This might not occur on regular or thinner papers.Othewrise, the cut radius and cut edge were consistent and smooth, respectively, for all 3 sizes. catch try is very handy.",4
B0076FJ7SS,"I got the Kadomaru Pro, and it's great. Of the things I tried it on, it cut through: 28 lb paper, photos, 100lb card stock, 14pt coated cardstock, a thin iron-on fabric patch, and 5 mil laminate. With all 3 sizes. You do have to place it on a surface and push down to do heavy materials. That was expected and not a problem. It did not cut through a plastic package. Very lightweight plastic appears to be too soft. The very best thing about it though is HOW it cuts. Hard to describe - the edges of the cut go to the edges of the paper (or whatever). Most other corner cutters the shape of the cut is rounded on the ends. A less than perfect alignment will result in a dent in your edge you can't really fix. THIS CUTTER - doesn't make a dent. If you screw up, it's just crooked, and you put it right back in and do it again correctly, problem solved. I was looking for this feature specifically, and I am VERY HAPPY with it.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"After trying the larger and more expensive corner rounders that took a lot of hand strength to work, I found this little gem. Has three sizes and so far I prefer the larger size and I am able to use it with one hand and a little effort. Would recommend",5
B0076FJ7SS,Great for cards and teacher decorations!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"I use various hand punches a lot. This one seems a little lightly built and a bit more plastic than I'm used to but. It is very well made, easy to use, and easy to line up. You can still muff a punch with this but using a crumb of patience with it (like with any hand punch) and it will deliver nice crisp cuts. I do suggest you use this with 65# or heavier stock, 20-24# paper is not liked by all but the tiniest of punches and can tearout or otherwise cut raggedly. (you can put a couple thicknesses of the thin papers if you are careful into this or any other larger punch and get a better punch)The S and M corners were a little small, especially the S, but if you are making small bookmarks or paper adornments under a few inches across, it looks well sized at that scale.Do have patience with this one, I take the catcher off and put it on the worksurface and move it every several punches to clear the cuts from being in the way and put the catcher back on when I store it. As always with any punch, run it a few times empty to help take any burrs or turned edges off your cut edges and help the punch work better when put into actual use. It gives me good cuts with somewhat fibrous or rough surface 110# and is easy to push. (not like some that you have to find your inner Hulk / gorilla to get to finish the punch stroke)",5
B0076FJ7SS,I like to laminate things and I always tried to make the corners rounded. I could never do a good job. Then I found this little gem. It does a great job!,5
B0076FJ7SS,Very easy to use and works on thicker materials - like laminated sheets! Thats the main thing I use it on and it's holding strong after a few months of frequent use. Also it's just fun to use! Give me more excuses to round the corners on things WHY IS IT SO SATISFYING???,5
B0076FJ7SS,I have tried countless different corner cutters and am always disappointed & return them because they never seem to cut.NOT the case with this cutter. BAM! This thing is amazing. Get one & throw away all the others you have!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"This edger is very durable and cuts well, however, it does hurt your hand after a while, if you have a bigger project. I use this to make rounded corners on laminated cards for homeschool teaching. Most of my projects I am rounding 4 corners on 40-80 cards, so bigger projects. I wish it was more ergonomically correct or easy to punch. But, I basically stand over a counter while using mine so that I can press down with my hand flat, and have less pressure on my hands. If you use it in a cupping pinch fashion, with your hand repeatedly you might feel carpel tunnel like symptoms. I'm 40 years old, and used to work for the USPS, so my hands were heavily used in my life. Maybe if you're 20, that won't be a problem. But, regardless, this thing does work and cut perfectly even after thousands of cuts. I'm fully satisfied with mine and doubt there's much better.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"""I don't have much to report about. I needed the product to round corners on laminated paper, and it does that just fine. It can be a bit tough on the hands if you're using it on many pieces of laminated paper. Maybe the blade should be a bit sharper. So far, it has been suitable for my needs",5
B0076FJ7SS,It's a great little machine that's perfect for corner punching. I've used it maybe a little less than 500 cuts and each one came out perfect!,5
B0076FJ7SS,This cutter does the best job,5
B0076FJ7SS,I like that it gives a smooth cut without a paper hangover. I will purchase more so that I may have a spare,5
B0076FJ7SS,I use this to bevel the corners of label maker stickers. Prevents sharp corners from peeling/lifting over time.,5
B0076FJ7SS,This works so well. Ive used some not so great quality ones and you can really tell the difference with this. Highly recommend spending the extra few dollars to get this good one!,5
B0076FJ7SS,"I should have known better and ordered this corner cutter first before ordering a much cheaper one.I returned the cheaper one and got this instead. I use it on laminate sheets for my budget planner. The feel is substantial and not rinky dink like the other one. The laminate slides into the exact spot that it should with no guessing if it went in all the way or not, like the other one. And the blade on this is sharp and cuts clean not like the other one. If you want perfect corners all the time, buy this one first and it will be your last. I hope I help someone out there too!",5
B0076FJ7SS,I wanted a punch that would last and have a bit of size to it. This has a nice size feels heavy in a positive way. Cuts 3 sizes for corners. Good purchase,4
B0076FJ7SS,"Best corner rounder I ever bought. Although I've only used it a few times, It cuts 5mil lamination paper with ease and no effort needed. I hope it lasts for a very long time. I just love this corner rounder. It was worth the wait.",5
B0076FJ7SS,Recommended 100%. Love this little corner rounder.,5
B0076FJ7SS,"I love this corner rounder.  It is a workhorse and so ergonomic and easy to use.  I purchased a pricey one that was sooo clumsy and left a frayed edge, so I sent it back.  Very disappointed in it .  I then bought this one and it's fantastic.  I've used it a couple of years and been very happy with it.  In the last couple of days I've punched over a hundred corners out of heavy 100 lb. wt. cardstock.  It punched so easily and clean.  I'm so happy!  Plus it has 3 different settings and when you punch, it catches the cuttings so they don't fly all over the place. I don't usually leave reviews unless it's over the top good.  This one is!  Buy this one!",5
B0076FJ7SS,Sturdy construction and does the job well. Expect it to last.,5
B0076FJ7SS,Very nice quality. Choose this one for sure,5
B0076FJ7SS,"If you're sick of shopping around for a high quality, sturdy, clean cutting corner punch like I was - Today is your lucky day!I was hesitant, because let's face it, it's pricy for a corner punch, and they are typically always unreliable.NOT this one! The Sunstar Pro is my baby.Cuts through the majority of materials you could/would ever want to. Works just as well on chipboard and cardstock as it does paper, and photo paper. It also works magic on most adhesive backed material, which is rare for most corner chompers on the market. I love that it features a self containing feature for waste. It's easy to remove, easy to clean, and stays secure.The punch itself seems to be very well constructed of high quality material. The lever is relatively easy to push. You also have the ability to push down with your palm if you choose to do so, the design itself seems well thought out, and deems itself practical.I've used this punch probably several thousand times, and it works just as well as the day I opened the package and made my first punch.I've attached a photo of the 3 different cuts this handy little device makes.I hope you save yourself some trouble, and purchase this corner rounder from the beginning. It doesn't disappoint.",5
B0076FJ7SS,"If I could, I would give it 6 stars. This punch, for costing less than $10, is amazing. BTW, there are many negative comments about the punch being hard to press. This is easily remedied. Be sure and press the button in the middle of the punch, and not on the end of the ""handle"". I dont' know why they put a handle on it to begin with. If you press on just the end of the handle and not the center, I think it puts a lopsided force on the mechanism, making it very hard to punch, since it misaligns the blade parts inside. I have punched card stock with ease - even stock laminated with 3 mil laminate is no problem. Be aware, though, that you are only going to be able to punch one sheet of stock at a time - you are not going to stack several sheets of paper in this thing. That being said, this is a well made product for a very reasonable price.Update 10-17-2017: I have used this punch on hundreds of cards and it is still going strong. I recently punched 10mil lamination and, to my surprise, it worked. It did take a little effort - a firm push on the center of the button. I am very impressed with this punch, especially for the price.",5
B0076FJ7SS,I purchased this to round the corners of bookmarks. More often than not it doesn't cut smoothly.,2
B0076FJ7SS,I use this to cut card corners.. this is perfect for making custom game cards. The 3mm size is all I use and it cuts clean. Can only do 1 at a time but that's okay. Came in a unmarked box in a shipping bag. Product is wrapped in a clear plastic bag within a box used for protection. (Plastic bag protection). Gets the job done. I recommend this product.,5
