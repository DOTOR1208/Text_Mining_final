B003EM7J9Q,I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt.,3
B001PB1C3C,"THESE ARE CHINESE NUTS, NOT AMERICAN.<br />I was deceived.<br />The country of origin is listed as ""America"" on the product's Amazon page.<br />However, when I received the nuts, they looked just like the Chinese nuts I had obtained from another vendor.<br />I checked with J&D (something I should have done before ordering) and was told the nuts are indeed Chinese.<br />I see from previous critiques on this page that I am not the only person who<br />was misled by the information on the Amazon product page.<br />Of course, there is a disclaimer on the page.<br />""Let the buyer beware.""<br />Let the Amazon buyer be doubly beware.",2
B000OIWY8Y,"I completely agree w/Grace Brunelle's comments. This the perfect dessert tea. I have given up sugar, but love coconut, and this is the perfect replacement. The smell in the bag is intoxicating, but it mellows to a soft vanilla/almond/coconut smooth sweetness when brewed. I have many excellent teas in my collection, but this beats many of them, especially if you are craving something sweet. Thank you Lana, please keep making (and quickly shipping) this fantastic tea!",5
B000P8HPCI,I ordered these olives based on the reviews.  Very disappointed and definitely felt I overpaid.  Would not buy again or recommend.  I gave some as a gift before trying and wish I hadn't.,1
B00509LWDA,"I was really excited to receive this product. However, it was so stale, the pieces of seaweed wouldn't even come apart. I couldn't even eat it, it was so bad and I had to throw it out.",1
B001E5DZTS,This stuff is fantastic.  My little girl loves it and it gives me the piece of mind knowing that I am not feeding her a huge amount of sugar with mainstream formulas.  Not to mention the other things they have found in them recently.  This is the closest thing to mothers milk.  If your baby spits up a lot you should definitely try this stuff.  My little girl hasn't spit up since I switched ever.  Love it.  Just wish I could buy even more at a time.,5
B007JFMH96,"These cookies have a very industrial, almost cardboard taste. Really nothing like any oatmeal cookies I have ever had. Somehow they managed to put almonds and chocolate in there without their flavors being detectable. What gives? The only plus is that you get 4 grams of fiber out of each cookie.",2
B0015DAEI4,"I did some research on this gum and found that the flavor crystals can burn or hurt your gums. One of my gums began having a problem shortly after I began to chew this old classic favorite of mine. I threw the whole big package of it into the garbage when my Dad said his mouth bothered him from chewing it as well. I suggest that if you feel anything different in your mouth you discontinue chewing this gum. Maybe there is a reason why it is no longer sold in stores, and this is it.",2
B002TMV34E,"I'm a casual coffee drinker who is more likely to like McDonalds or Duncan Donuts coffee than Starbucks, which I find too burnt. I also like sugar and milk so I'm not obsessing over subtleties of flavor. This coffee was noticably better than supermarket brands and, in my opinion, milder and superior to the fancy brands as well. It is a good quality coffee at a good price and, as a result, a good value. I'd recommend this and would consider this as an every-day brand.",4
B002GURBZ4,"This stuff worked out great for my Disco Ball Birthday Cake.  My customer loved it! Check it out [...]<br />If you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats, you found it.",5
B000LKXJEI,"I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (11g protein, 3g unsaturated fat, 7g carbs.). The Teriyaki variety is a little bland in comparison to some of the other flavors. This may be exactly what some people are looking for. I prefer a little more kick.",4
B001BDDTB2,"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one.",3
B000MIDROQ,"This is one of the better quality products Chef Boyardee provides in a container instead of a can, thank goodness ! I am grateful this product contains NO hazardous chemical dyes for enhancement of color, taste, texture and consistency; therefore I review that it is still healthy ! I am not hip on boxed, container-bound or prepared items of anything but when fresh is too expensive and quick is the 'theme' for the day, Chef Boyardee comes in handy and safely off my local grocers shelf to my kitchen table. The microwaveable feature may be a plus to some, but our family avoids the danger 'radiating any food' can do.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and<br /><br />Enjoy !<br /><br />miss erica hidvegi,<br />the Enlightenment Advisor",3
B001LGGH40,"While I didn't like this flavor as well as the black cherry, it was still quite good.  Had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet, probably because there is no added sugar.  You won't miss the sugar and neither will your kids.  This is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesn't have all the additives that soda does.  It's basically carbonated fruit juice.  It's 100% juice, so you get a nice dose of Vitamin C (100% daily allowance according to the can).  Adults will enjoy it too.  The can is 8.3 oz., which is smaller than a 12-oz soft drink, but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving, without filling you or your kids up too much.  Sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added, so these are not health drinks, but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas.",4
B001M074MY,"Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets!",3
B0083QJU72,"It is not as sweet as I thought it would be for a Grade B syrup but good maple flavor and dark amber color.  I got two jugs, one for me and one for a gift.",4
B003DIOTX0,"I was excited by the extra cheesy on the box but didn't pay enough attention to realize that it wasn't just more cheese powder, which I think the non-deluxe kind needs. This cheese sauce, while creamier, is pretty disgusting.",2
B00390T5JA,I bought this unit because of the Kurig name thinking it would be a quality machine.I have had it  about nine months and have trouble with the pump not filling up the cup on either size.I called Kurig and they had no response other than descale it.For the price of this unit you shouldn't have to descale every week. I am very disappointed with this unit and wouldn't buy another one.I will try either a Cuisinart or Mr Coffee.Kurig lost a customer here hope others fare better than I.,2
B0013NUGDE,"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.",3
B002ZF06JI,"I bought this product because it is a great deal, rawhides in any brick and mortar store are outrageous, so I was very excited about this deal. However; this product makes my dog throw-up, and I know its not just rawhides in general because I have given her other ones with no difficulty. I also noticed she is not as interested in these rawhides as she has been in past brands (although this is not an issue because they as getting thrown either way. I have not contacted the seller about this yet but will be in the next couple days. I contacted amazon and they had great customer service and said they would look into the issue.",1
B0081GVC98,"So if you have ever bought Bertie Bots you know you get almost nothing for the price.  But I love these flavors so much that I kept searching until I stumbled onto Weasley Wizard Beans and I was VERY happy I did.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer it is quite fun to leave these out for kids and see the expression on their face when they get a gross flavor, but actually some strange ones are actually good, like grass and soap if you ask me.",4
B000G6RYNE,"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle BrandÂ® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle BrandÂ®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.",5
B001P737PC,"I love this popcorn! I like popcorn very much, but I usually eat too much of it. I keep these bags at work for when I want a snack. If I had the big bags, I would eat the whole thing. These are perfect...it seems like you get a big pile of popcorn, but know you still are okay with calories compared to a candy bar (or even 4-5 hershey kisses!) I have tried other 100-calorie things and it is like you get some pitiful amount, but the popcorn seems like a real treat!<br /><br />I see it is currently out of stock and not available for subscribe and save :(  I hope they get more because it is really the most tasty/buttery flavored of the brands I have tried.",5
B00248CB30,"Drank 30 of these, about 1 each day for a month.  Felt no effects.  Did not give me energy or keep me awake.  Taste was horrible too.  If you want a mate tea that works try: Pacific Natural Foods Organic Traditional Mate.",1
B003A9S5SC,"These didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.  They are organic and made with whole wheat flour, so that was the positive!  We eat them with hummus and other dips.",3
B002DLXXHG,"bought two bags and at the time the details did not include the ingredients. says ""naturally"" not once but twice on the bag. am allergic to monosodium glutamate so this stuff might as well be guano. better-half ate half a bag and EVERY piece of it eaten was full of silverskin.",1
B001D0IZBM,"Not like I eat ash but that was the impression I had. I did not care for the taste. maybe a better way to describe is bitter, burnt. I definitely won't steal this from my coworker again!",2
B0058AMY74,"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.",4
B001BIXK7K,A drop at a time in a bowl (or pot) of chili will give you the heat level you want. I will save a lot of money on peppers for my chili. A little on a toothpick brought a fellow heat lover to tears.,5
B000FA38ZY,"Five star cookie:<br />Let me be clear, I love Mallomars and have done since the late 40's as a kid.  In fact, it's still my #2 favorite commercial cookie (behind the now unavailable Mother's Iced Raisin Cook ... ohhhhh momma!). I've been known to buy out the total supply of our local Kroger's which ordered them as a special request item and started stocking them intermittently.  It's the See's candy of cookies in it's fresh version.<br /><br />1 Star sample:<br />Unfortunately the sample I received for review under the Amazon Vine program did not measure up.  They were clearly old, white filmed chocolate, powdery cookie, most of them had fallen apart and the marshmallow was rubbery.  What a disappointment.  I can only imagine the frustration if I'd have paid for them and had 4 boxes delivered like this.<br /><br />While I can't recommend Mallomars highly enough, I'd suggest obtaining them from a local store.  They aren't available everywhere year-round but during the cooler months they make it out to California so they should be available in most decent sized urban areas at least.<br /><br />I've had mixed results with grocery items from Amazon and with a Prime membership and 2nd day air automatic one can only assume that there is a problem in storage or logistics somewhere.  At the premium price asked you might want to make some Toll House cookies and let it go at that.",3
B000FNEX50,"Nana's cookies are good eaten plain.  They are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour.<br /><br />The cookies are individually packaged.  I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact.",5
B000CONMBS,"Pirate booty is a little pricier than other side-items I get to make lunches with, however it is all-natural. This is huge for me, that and my child NEVER gets tired of it.

Since the product is mostly air an ounce looks like an awful lot, but it'll be finished in no time!",4

B00472I5A4,"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!",1

B000KJF2R2,The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees I've tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good.,3
B005K4Q1VI,This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out.,4
B001EQ5OYQ,"I love dried peaches and normally respect the SunMaid brand. As such, I thought these were a bargain ($12 for a 6-pack). Unfortunately, they have a pungent smell that is kind of funky and turns me off. They are edible, but I think I'll give away my 4 unopened packs to the local food bank rather than eating them.",2
B001QW6LMW,"Note that I'm not recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis: the two types of animals generally need different kinds of foods and nutrients. However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* specifically mentioned taurine on the label, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily. The cats absolutely adore it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety.<br /><br />The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat. The wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source, and there are precious few protein sources that don't make them sick (I'm limited to chicken, turkey, rabbit, and a small amount of fish usually). Because the brushtail is wild it isn't grain fed, and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients. Also, according to the company, it's an overpopulated nuisance pest, so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there. What's not to love?",5
B002NHYQAS,"I love chocolate and was really disappointed by the weak, almost non-existent chocolate taste of this bar.  Since there are no milk solids in dark chocolate, it is supposed to provide a deeper pronounced chocolate flavor.  However, this bar doesn't provide much in the way of chocolate flavor. There's no immense pleasure derived as the chocolate melts in your mouth which makes the bar not worthy of its caloric content.<br /><br />Break off a piece and hold it against the roof of your mouth and run your tongue over the bottom of it.  It feels sort of waxy, and it takes a bit of work before the chocolate flavor starts to come through, and when it does, it's nothing to really appreciate.  Flat tasting is a good way to describe this bar.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this, and I don't recommend it.",2

B005GWYMME,"Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment.

B000Z978SS,I was so excited to receive this. Thought I would cut down on the calories. I didn't like the taste at all. We baked a banana bread and we threw it out.

B001LG940E,"At almost a buck a can -- a SMALL can, I expected to be blown away.  Unfortunately, I was not.  It is basically juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with it, and I wouldn't throw it out or anything, but I suppose I found it a bit boring.<br /><br />To be fair, I do not drink that much 'regular' soda anyway. This one had good flavor, just like carbonated cherry juice (maybe a *little diluted). It was refreshing and did not have any bad aftertaste.  It is all natural, has no corn syrup, no caffeine, and no artificial colors.  Plus, as a bonus, you get 100% of your vitamin C for the day.<br /><br />For what it is worth, my wife loves sodas, especially cherry and felt the same way. Her current favorite, Dr. Brown's Black Cherry, sells in cases of 24 cans (12oz cans) for about a buck a can, too.  Dr. Brown's has high fructose corn syrup as the second ingredient, with Cherry flavor as the third and a artificial color at the end of the list.<br /><br />If you are trying to find an alternative to all of the chemical brews available out there, this could be a viable alternative for you.",3

B004YV80OE,"This is Velveeta's attempt to be a dinner-in-a-box like Hamburger Helper products and variations.  You provide the chicken, Kraft offers the cheese, pasta and seasonings.  Nothing extraordinary but it qualifies as a quick dinner fix when you aren't in the mood to cook a whole lot.  The seasonings were tasty but honestly, anything with Velveeta cheese as a main background can't help but be yummy. The freeze-dried brocoli barely came close to remsebling the real thing in looks much less taste. My end results didn't look anything like the picture on the front of the box but it tasted fine.  I do think Hamburger Helper is better in capturing flavors and more satisfying in the fill-you-up department but this is a good attempt at the same thing.

B001FA1L7A,I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.  I prefer it to other powdered custard(pudding) products for ease of making and taste. It's wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. Amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price.,5
B00503DP0O,"These Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are very good to me. They are the size of a thick medium cookie, are slightly chewy, and are very tasty despite the fact that they do not taste sweet at all.<br /><br />Although coconut is lower in the ingredient list, the cookie tastes mostly like coconut and I didn't taste the chocolate at all.  However, since I like coconut very much, I enjoyed these bars.<br /><br />The first three ingredients in order are gluten-free oats, organic agave, and a rice blend. As for the rest of the cookie's name, chocolate chunks is the fourth ingredient and coconut is the tenth ingedient. The cookie contains eggs and almonds as well. The package claims that you get 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and 9 grams of whole grain per bar.<br /><br />Each bar is 180 calories with 80 calories from fat. Nevertheless, these are certainly a better choice than a candy bar and are gluten free.

His comments were that the taste of this was awful, and although he did feel an increased level of energy, he'd never buy this but would stick with Monster or Red Bull.

B008DQ76W8,I picked up a box of Betty Crockers Mac and Cheese:Cheese Pizza at a local supermarket for about 79 cents. The cooking directions threw me off a bit but it was easy enough to prepare.

The flavor of the pasta was more or less what you would expect from boxed macaroni and cheese but with some garlic notes an not much else.,3
B002Y775V4,"When I first opened the bottle it smelled medicinal. I added it to some iced tea and it tasted just like it smelled, very medicinal and only a trace of fruit flaver.

They do fail to mention that you have to boil the potatoes first.  The gloves are huge - I normally buy a large in dishwashing gloves.  The fingers are so long that they were flopping around and the gloves are so big and cumbersome that it took me about 2 minutes each to get the first 2 done..  After that, I threw this useless ""gadget"" in the sink and got out a knife.  The instructions say to just rinse them off and let dry - yeah, good luck with that.",1

B004ZIER34,"While I certainly prefer a fresh-roasted whole-bean coffee, burr-ground, and seasoned before brewing, I am inclined to drink a cup of coffee no matter the source or preparation.  My general preference runs to darker roasts, taken black.  I prepared the Puroast in a Technivorm Moccamaster, though I did back down to a bit less than the full three ounces against 10 cups of filtered water.<br /><br />The result was disappointing.  The brew was strong enough, and certainly presented a low-acidity.  That said, the flavor is fairly flat, with almost a chemical or plastic undertone.  There is no complexity to the brew, where even a run-of-the-mill Folgers offers some flavor signature.<br /><br />For someone who cannot tolerate the acid in a typical cup, it is coffee.  For anyone else, there are better-tasting alternatives for less money.",2

B000084ETV,"I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just ""something she picked up,"" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!",1

Cooks well; no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting, and I had some left over. I think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same. Really cool stuff, and no additional taste of french fries, or other stir-fried items. Coolness!!",5
B001S38AK0,"If you're not used to dark chocolate, Ghirardelli 72% takes a while to get used to because it's flavor is stronger than most others in the 70-72% range. I used to like Lindt 70% (before they changed the recipe), but Ghirardelli's flavor is more unadulterated and stronger, with a bitterness and 'bite' that I like. A lot of other chocs (especially the more common supermarket brands) strive for smoothness and creaminess...in other words yuck. This one doesn't. 72% is a very nice cocoa percentage. This is my staple chocolate in the 70-72% range. I have tasted even better chocs in this cocoa range, but they are organic ones from the health food store that cost at least 1/3rd more.",4

I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine! Highly recommended!!!  GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf. On my machine the recommended setting is BASIC and the loaf bakes in 4 hours. Also, the flour is NON GMO Verified as labelled.",5

I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad.

Chicken broth was used to make that soup, too.  But these split peas were much more flavorful.  They cooked up much better as well, meaning that the first brand's peas must have been old, bcs after an hour or more they were still tough.  So, that tells me these are fresh, and superior.",4
B0006NEHLY,"Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.

For those of you that arnt familure with ASIO it is a driver/program that runs and samples your audio going in, you basically use it with anything that is MIDI or MIDI/MIC to USB.

B0049ZCF9G,"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.

B004HOLD92,"I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>.

B000NY8ODS,"This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",5

So it should average a 3+ but no fractional stars are permitted.",3

B000CQ4D3C,"I am a huge fan of the original annie's pasta meals, so when this came out I thought it was a good idea. However, it was poorly executed. When you use the recomended amount of water, its to water, even after 10 mintues of sitting. Too little, your noodles will clump together and get undercooked. Obviously they didn't test this product enough. Stick to original annie's!",1

B001H0FHXW,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>Maybe living in Seattle has made me a bit of a coffee snob, but this caffe lungo does not really impress!<br /><br />See video for demonstration.<br /><br />The instructions have two ways to pull the beverage. 4 ounces for a ""long espresso"" (this is a lungo) or 6 ounces for an Americano. (Note: this is not actually an Americano which is hot water added to espresso, it's a just a longer lungo)<br />I have tried preparing the beverage in both ways. The 6 oz pull results in a coffee that is not strong enough and is slightly watery... The 4 oz way is definitely much stronger but still is far from bold or full-bodied. I still prefer my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3ZF76"">Lello 1375 Ariete Cafe Prestige</a> which gives me the flexibility of using whichever beans I prefer. One of my favorites (besides some local roasters) is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002E2FH0"">Lavazza Super Crema</a> which is a much bolder and full-bodied coffee.",3

B000CRHQN0,"I love Think Thin Bars.  Love them.  I eat one every morning. This crunchy peanut butter is my favorite.  ""Subscribe and save"" seems like a bargain, but by the time I was six months into the program, the bars I was receiving were bloomed, chalky, and gave every appearance of having been stored in a hot place, which certainly compromised the quality and eating experience (and maybe even the nutritional value, like the vitamins).  I cancelled my subscription, and am back to buying them at a higher price at my local grocery store.",2
B006BXUYN8,"So are energy bars the new fad of eating? Perhaps taking milk out of the equation has led to people finding other sources of energy besides a bowl of sugared cereals. Companies like Kellogs I am sure had to find some means of ""keeping up"" by reconstituting their own brands. Special K, perhaps their most popular ""healthiest"" cereal has come up with this Granola Bar which advertises 4 grams of Fiber and 4 grams of protein. While they advertise the benefits, one should not glare over the fact that this is a ""chocolatey peanut butter"" bar.<br /><br />A serving size is one (1) bar which is 110 calories. There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says ""4g of fiber*"". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says ""4g of fiber"" it reads: ""3g of total fat"". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless.",3

This one is ok.",3
B0042GZSU0,"Definitely not a generic box of chocolate that you buy from your grocery, but I wasn't too impressed otherwise.  Many pieces, the chocolate covering was just too thin.  The other problem, I feel their chews are just too hard/tough.  Quite a few pieces had a waxy, dry hue to them--like they were old.  I sampled two assorted (one mix, one dark).  Felt the cremes in the bunch were the best of the lot--some nice flavors and thick texture.  I know I will probably sound like a shill but Loweryscandies out of indiana are my favorite, but hey, look at my other product reviews--I'm no shill!",3
B000G17Y9I,"My husband and I love these chips - they aren't very salty and the strip shape makes them great for dipping in salsa/dips.

At first, I was not impressed- thinking that I just overpaid for some upgraded Folgers- but then I figured it out. The secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches- At first I was making 4-5 cups at a time in my small coffee pot- then I cut that back to a two cup using approx. 3 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee- It was AMAZING!!! The depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable. Definitely something worth trying at least once- I for one will be looking forward to the next time I can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee...",5
B004U7QXMS,"The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these ""improvements"" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.",3

B001IZIC7E,"My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product.",4

I've moved on to making pots of Dunkin Decaf at home for everyday drinking, but I love these VIA for travel or just an afternoon cuppa. I do wish there were more options in decaf flavors.",4
B00006IDJO,"One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure.",1
B0034KP00S,"I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)",5

B0026RQTGE,"I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing.",2

B000DZFMEQ,"Firstly, let me say that this is a great product if you are looking for a wheat free bread as I was.<br />It's moist, tasty and great for bread machines.<br /><br />The only reason I ordered this was because of the big 23% OFF sign, however what they reduced in product price, they made back in shipping.  Also, there was NO DISCOUNT for buying 6 packets.<br />Price including shipping was $36 and change.<br /><br />Bottom line is that instead of waiting several days to buy this product, just go to your local Fred Meyer where it's sold for $6 per packet! If they had not ""reduced"" the price by 23%, then you would be getting ripped off severely as you would be paying close to $10 more - you can get an entire grocery list delivered to your home from Fred Meyer for about the same!!<br />When you factor in that you also get club card rewards, you are better off buying it from Fred Meyer than direct from the manufacturer....I won't be ordering online again.<br /><br />But good product!",4
B002IEZJMA,I had high hopes for this drink despite the fact that I prefer unsweetened drinks.  I poured it in the glass and was unhappy with how dark it was.  I took a sip and choked.  This drink is bitter and to me undrinkable.  It was like drinking the bottom of a burned pot of coffee.  I tried adding milk to the cup but it didn't lighten the color at all.  Even with the milk I couldn't drink it and down the drain it went.  Awful!,1

The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.  I notice amazon is out of stock, currently.  Perhaps, Keurig is looking into the matter.",1
B005ZBZLT4,"I really liked this coffee, but it will not be on my list of coffees to buy again because of the one major flaw.  It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again.",2

However, I have recently found out that cacao powder has the highest source of THEOBROMINE which a neurotoxin.

You might be very surprised to learn of these side-effects as I was myself but please do your OWN RESEARCH and you will come across same conclusions.<br />Even the natives in South America never used cacoa as supplements. The fresh fruit from that comes from cacao plant(aka theobroma plant) is what the natives eat and use for making drinks. The fruit is harmless but it is the seeds inside the fruit, which are used to make this powder or any chocolate, that are extremely harmful.<br />I have heard Carob is an excellent alternative.",1

Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!",2
B002NHYQAS,"I eat a lot of good chocolate like Valrhona, Domori, & Green & Black. Newman's Own is in no way on par with better chocolates, but it is better than average. They tried hard to make it something special but I won't be buying again. There are much better chocolate bars out there.",3
B003UMI3G8,"I'm of Asian descent, a serious tea drinker, and a big fan of anything citrus.  I wanted so badly to like this tea.  I bought a single box on sale from my local grocery store to try out first, as I didn't want to commit to a whole case from Amazon right away.  Boy, am I glad I did.  We try to choose organic whenever possible, but this tea has the overpowering aroma of lemon Pine Sol. My coworkers are laughing and concurring as we speak.  One down, seventeen tea bags left to go... Maybe I'll save it for the next time one of us comes down with a cold.",2
B0012XBD7I,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!",2
B001EQ55RW,"I found these nuts to be a tad bland.  The chocolate was not very flavorful and did nothing to enhance the experience.  It seemed like two flavors that did not blend.  These seemed a halfway measure of dipping in chocolate and eating the almonds straight.  I would prefer either of those ways to these.  I was left with the impression of diet food - not quite what you really want, but a poor substitution.",3
B004R8J8EK,"My mom never made this but my husband had fond memories....  so we decided to try it.  It is quick and easy and tastes pretty good (though it might benefit from some added cayenne).

Actually it was a bit bitter and now I have all of this tea I know it will take me forever to drink because of the flavor..  Was not happy..  :(,1
B000EVOSE4,"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,",1
B00412W76S,I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling.

B000EZMRQG,"I was happy to try a jerky without preservatives for my son, but this is extra extra chewy and my 13 year old won't eat it - he prefers the turkey jerky I make. I was surprised he complained about the flavoring too. Make sure this is what you want before you invest.",2

B001LG940E,"For a product that has no added sweeteners, this drink is very sweet. It has a strong cherry and something-other-than-cherry flavor, and just enough carbonation to remind you of soda. The 8.3oz serving size was definitely enough for me because I found it cloyingly sweet. The color was the natural color of cherry juice mixed with water or seltzer, so I didn't find that surprising.<br /><br />If you enjoy very sweet drinks, this is definitely for you. It was way too sweet for me, and I didn't like the something-other-than-cherry flavor. It made it taste ""off"" to me.",2

B001TZL6ZS,"I was surprised how many haters there are for the Lite version. Disclaimer: I've never tried the full fat version and I'm sure it's delicious, but if you're watching your fat intake, there has to be some compromise.  I saw this at the grocery store next to the regular Baconnaise.<br />Lite version: 2.5 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br />Original version: 9 grams fat per 2 Tbl.<br /><br />I'm used to eating lite variations (though not fat free, yuck) of sour cream, mayo, salad dressing, etc.  So this wasn't a big leap for me. First sandwich, I was not impressed. Second sandwich, meh. By the third sandwich I was hooked. When by bottle ran out I had a hard time going back to plain mayo. I've been eating it so much that I don't even want to try the fattier version b/c then I'll be eating even more, yikes!<br /><br />It may not be a good taste for everyone, and I can understand that.

However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?",1

B001CWZXIY,"A few years back, prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor, I switched my dogs to foods without corn.  I was convinced, right or wrong, that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections.  I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!  I haven't seen them so spunky and full of energy.  I've got a coon hound and two jack russells (mine are not the ""bounce off the wall kind"", mine are mellow, laid back kinda dudes!)  They gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full...no more begging in the kitchen than normal! Everyone's skin seems smoother, eyes are brighter, heck, I think I'll go have a bowl!

He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally.

Any vestige of nutrition that these bars might contain presumably comes from the manufacturer artificially adding in vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />It's hard to consider this a food product. One could imagine the day will arrive when any organic substance found in the average kennel could be processed to contain a soft creamy multivitamin center so the packaging could boast that it contained 100% of FDA daily requirements. Until that day arrives, this product should suffice.",2

There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.",2
B002GWHCLK,"The only other flavored coffee I've used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.<br /><br />Where the Nestle's shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isn't anything like hazelnut<br /><br />Now I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!<br /><br />More Info:<br />I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Today's grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really don't have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park.",1
B001LG940E,"The Switch is the latest entry in the `healthy' fruit juice + carbonated water movement.  And, the black cherry flavor is, indeed, flavorful, but its taste is more apple than black cherry and it is far too sweet for my taste. Which leads me directly to this point . .<br /><br />don't make the switch in order to save calories.  This 8.3 ounce can contains 130 calories, more than 8.3 ounces of Classic Coke (101 calories) or 8.3 ounces of Pepsi (104 calories).<br /><br />The manufacturer says no sugar has been added to this fruit drink.  Here the operative word is ""added."" With 33 grams of sugar listed on the label, this drink is loaded with fructose.  It does contain vitamin C, but otherwise, there's not much here to support the manufacturer's claim that this drink is a healthy alternative to anything.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Izze for almost a year, and even asked our local grocer to stock it (he didn't, but both Target and WalMart do).  So will I switch to The Switch?  Not.  Izze's juice drinks have more of the advertised flavor but 35 fewer calories.<br /><br />By the way, the manufacturer's site says ""The Switch"" refers to a skateboarding move rather than a suggestion to change to their brand.  Hmmm - are they trying to tell me something?<br /><br />Three stars",3

The pods and the Senseo machine are perfect for this; barely takes 2-minutes to brew.  The 6-pack box comes out to about 30cents a cup even with the added latte packets (60cents when two are used for a strong mug serving).  Wonderful aroma and works well with the flavor packets.

B004P4TL8E,"Ordered this on the advice of the Single Serve Coffee forum.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh, so it doesn't slide smoothly.  It's pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close.<br />It doesn't pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K-Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top.<br />Again, all mesh, so the cups don't sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly.<br />My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didn't leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />For our modern kitchen, it's nice to look at.<br />It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space.<br />When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.<br /><br />All in all, for $25 it's a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I don't need my coffee to be on display.

I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.

And I don't think they've been successful here. While these taste good, they do not taste anything like Mozzarella. The mild taste might be an appeal to some who just want a slightly-cheesy cracker.

The effect was immediate, and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers. Everyone was completely in love with the lemons, and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well. For some the effect was actually too sweet, and they gave up after a few foods. Other foods/beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries (lost their tartness), red wine vinegar (sweet on the tongue, but not so great in the throat) and Corona (loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it). It certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid, but it's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining.",4

B001SATX2M,"I know this is supposed to be sweetened and creamy. But drinking a cup of it, I could not shake the idea that I was instead drinking a hot and melted tube of cake icing. Detecting the coffee flavoring which was supposed to allow it to be called 'coffee' was really difficult.<br /><br />Buying it because of the pre-made convenience (and okay the cheap selling price) is self-defeating when the coffee does not taste like coffee. It was next to impossible for me to detect! So, I'd rather pay a little more for halfway deccent coffee, and have to obtain milk and sugar separately.<br /><br />It's certainly not the type of product which you would want to serve in a 'high society' environment hoping to impress your guests about knowledge of coffee. It's international, but the coffee concept is not on par with Italian Cappuccino.<br /><br />But on a plus side, you can drink several cups of this stuff without worrying if it will keep you up at night.

I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back! I then did a little research and realize that this is the new flavor of this formula using a new variety of coconut and from concentrate. I really don't like this new flavor at all.

Rose Preserves go wonderfully with both sweet and savory foods. Try it with goat cheese or Brie, you will not be disappointed. It's also divine over ice cream. And do not get me started on how great it is for baking...<br /><br />These preserves are quite sweet, so a little really does goes a long way (which is nice, the jar lasts quite a while even when I use it often).

B007R1PGVS,"This product works but the advertising is misleading. Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?",3

They had a hint of chocolate without being overpowering. The oats were a rolled oats but it was not over powering like some granola bars. The bar is about two inches by three inches and a prefect little snack.<br /><br />On the downside, the bars are really crumbly, almost like there is nothing really holding them together. Because of that, I had to keep them in a container to carry them in my munchie bag.  The bars are real small and are 180 calories.

No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients.

Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina.",1

B0062A87HA,"I am SO disappointed.  Even though I read many reviews complaining of dented cans, I took a chance because of the pumpkin shortage & my family's regular use of pumpkin (a ""superfood""!)  But I just received the package, which seemed to be packed sufficiently, yet once I opened it up fully, every single can was dented.  Some severely.  Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.  The only thing I can figure is that the manufacturer is using this a way to get rid of damaged cans, because nobody would pick a can up in the store that looked like the cans I received.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon customer service and I'm sure they will come through for me - I have never had a problem dealing with them.  But beware if you are buying this product.  Maybe the dented cans were just a fluke but all 12...???<br /><br />**update: Amazon customer service was a breeze to deal with and sent me a new case and again, EVERY can was dented.  Some severely.  I won't try again.  Very disappointed.",1

B000261MX6,"I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).",1
B00503DP0O,"I tried this product because I love Pamela's baking and pancake for making chocolate chip cookies (and pancakes), and I was hoping this cookie would be good.  Well, the ""good"" is it has some decent ingredients (some fiber, aguave, rice blend flour-- no high frucose corn syrup) but the ""bad"" is it tastes terrible.  I couldn't even finish the one cookie (it comes in a small rectangular bar, maybe 2 and a half inches long by an inch plus wide and 1/2 inch thick.  I'm usually pretty good with words, but although I like the texture, moist part of this cookie, the flavor is indescribably dreadful; I wish I could be more precise, it negatively tickles the taste buds.  You don't feel you would get sick eating it, but you might consider using it as a torture on someone. I would ask my wife to try it, but I want to live.  There are other better products on the market that taste much better, power bars, etc.  Some people may question aguave being ""good,"" but I think it is better than staight sugar or corn syrup--correction--there is some evaporated cane sugar in the product as well as coconut sugar. It has 180 calories, so keep that in mind.",2

B001NH40UA,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value.

(Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas.",5

While it is good that the treats will be eaten and will not be wasted, mixing it with food seems to defeat the purpose of a treat.<br /><br />They are made of great ingredients and not made in China, which is a great thing if you are concerned about some of the junk that has been put into dog food as filler ingredients. I give it three stars because, despite my finicky dog's lack of a desire to snatch them from my hand, the treats smell good and this appears to be a trustworthy and relatively healthy offering.",3

B005SPHEPQ,"I have two kids with food allergies so I am very limited to what I can use in the house. Between two of them, we can't have milk, eggs, soy, wheat, nuts, and corn. So what is left?? only rice milk (well, I tried oat, sunflower, hemp, etc but I could not get used to the taste). I usually buy rice milk from refridgerated section at the supermarket. I needed poweder milk to use for baking and to mix with my coffee. When you mix this powder with any liquid, it does not disolve well and you have to mix it very well. I usually have to use a back of spoon against a cup and stir multiple times. Other than that, the task is good (well it is not like MILK, as you know) and it does give choices to people with food allergies. So, I really appreciated that they came up with this product. If you can take regular milk, you might want to stick with milk. But if you have food allergies, this is a good alernative product to purchase.",4

B001E53UTS,"Of the four different flavors of the Lipton beverage mixes that I've tried this one had the best flavor. It sounds weird to mix these 2 flavors but since neither one is actually what they tried for it didn't come out too bad. But, it still has the same problem that the other Lipton mixes have. It doesn't dissolve very well and no matter how much you shake it there's still some chunks in the bottom of the bottle.<br />  On the plus side, since I started trying the various powder single beverage mixes a couple of months ago, I've dropped a little over 25 pounds. Even though I did like the flavor of this one, for the price of it compared to the other brands available, I doubt that I will ever buy it again.",3

Cherryfield Candy sent this product very fast... very good response to my order. Wrappings are cute, easy to open, nice sized small drop. But the one thing missing is the coffee taste. It's almost tasteless. My problem, I guess, is that I'm comparing it to another more expensive heavily-coffee-flavored larger hard candy. From the good price, I thought these might be smaller items, but with an equally strong coffee taste. I was wrong. I liked Cherryfield's service, but do not care for this product; I will not order these candies again. Out of 5 possible stars, I would give this product a 2 1/2.",2

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.

The biscuit is thick and hard, and it is scored down the middle so that owners of mid-sized dogs can break it in half. I don't think it's going to be small enough for small dogs, and it's hard to break other than where it is scored. I'm sure these will get eaten, and I'm glad they are organic and have good ingredients, but they weren't especially a favorite. I would say my dog likes the Newman chicken biscuits, the heart-shaped ones, better. They are thinner, and possibly easier to chew, altho he doesn't really hesitate about chewing bones. Not really sure what goes on in his mind, but maybe a hard cookie is not enticing enough for an energetic chew?",3
B005C3IVN8,"I've tried a few different maple syrups, but this is absolutely the best I have tried.<br /><br />First off, grade B has a much more delicious maple flavor than grade A without being overpowering. This brand is not as thick as most syrups, but it's a quality I happen to love. It's way less sticky and you can easily get out every last drop from the jug without having to set it upside down or breaking out a knife to scrape the jug.<br /><br />I love adding a spoonful into some almond or soy milk for a touch of sweetness, mixing in with some peanut butter (try it, it's delicious!), or making the best tasting lemonade on Earth.<br /><br />Even if you're not on the master cleanse or don't feel it's necessary/healthy you should still try the lemonade just to drink. It's way better than any refined sugar lemonade I've ever had!

B0041NYV8E,"When I opened the pouch, I sniffed the contents and found the aroma to be intensely complex and inviting! I tried a little pinch of it raw -- and it excited my taste buds -- very enjoyable. I even think that the contents would be spectacular if sprinked over vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream -- this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix is VERY gingery and sweet --- and with a nice lemon tang.<br /><br />So I dumped the remaining contents of the pouch into a cup and added hot water -- It steamed up very nicely, mixed VERY well and the first few sips were intense, delicious, just great. But THEN this mixture started burning my throat so intensely that I had to cut it with Soy Milk to turn off the overpowering heat -- turning the remainder of the contents into a refreshing, sweet, but mild experience.<br /><br />Now some people might LIKE all that extra heat-- I couldn't handle it. For those who like the Ginger/Lemon experience but are not fans of spicy hot-ness, then perhaps divvying up the contents of one pouch into TWO cups of tea would be a better way to enjoy this intense experience.",4

B001ELLB4S,"I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture.",3

It listed only a few ingredients: Rice, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopherols (Vitamin E), alpha-Amylase (Enzyme), Electrolytic Iron. Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves ""normal"" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber.

My poor baby screamed for a full day trying to poop.  After I started mixing the 2 formulas, we nolonger have that issue and spit up is greatly reduced.  Its so much better than adding rice cereal to thicken formula b/c this has no clumps and doesn't clog the nipples.  I mix up a pitcher of this formula b/c its hard to mix and foams up at first.",3
B001AJ1ULS,"My dog LOVED these treats.  Then one day, i actually read the packaging and saw these are made in china!  I feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken, when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices.  They buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china, a MASSIVE factory.  And are fully aware of the FDA issued warnings about chicken products from China killing pets.  They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!  Do your research and read every label CLOSELY as they really try and fool you with the fine print.",1

B0019GVBYI,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Healthy<br />+Unique taste<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Unique taste<br /><br />Overall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine.",3

B00348MFQW,"This is distinctly different than Gold Label Gran Riserva! While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great. We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva Gold Label and it was amazing. This vinegar is much sharper and thinner. It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva. The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no.<br />According to one of the vendors, all that was changed was the label.  They told me that ""the year denotation of '12 years' had to be taken off of the bottle"" and ""the label had to be changed because of Italian government regulation."" The vendor and Fattoria Estense are saying the new Gold Label 'Invecchiato Aged' is exactly the same balsamico, but IMHO it sure doesn't taste the same. I wouldn't buy it again - not at this price!",2

B001AHJMWO,"Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the ""cauldron"" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of ""hot chocolate"" per container if you like the ""flavor"" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand.",1
B000H7CURW,"Dave's Gourmet is probably the hot foods brand I hold in the highest regard so I was hoping that the Popcorn would be every bit as good as their sauces and Dave's Burning Nuts. Insanity Popcorn is spicy but without a lot of flavor. It lacks really much definition, its really buttery, or smokey. Instead its somewhat salty with a lingering heat. Its reasonably spicy but without insanely hot or great flavor (or both), its mostly novelty.  On paper it sounds like a great idea but I don't think popcorn is probably the best delivery mechanism for hot foods sadly.  Its not bad but its not great either. Other customers seem to love it to so buy and try.",3

This stuff tastes really close, and you can adjust the amount of water to create the consistency you like.  My only problem is the cost. This jar doesn't make an equivalent jar full of the final product.  To demonstrate, this jar makes enough for about 4 or 5 peanut butter sandwiches.  Again, I am a peanut butter lover, and this tastes great.  My only problem is the cost.  P.S. I've lost 130 pounds over the last 18 months, so to me the cost is worth it.

B000GG0BNE,"I bought the Bigelow Green Tea after tasting how delicious the Bigelow I Love Lemon tea is. Here's a few pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price wise - great price, $14.99 after 15% with Subscribe & Save and Free shipping for 240 tea bags comes out to around 6.2 cents each tea bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />Figured they be individually wrapped like the I Love Lemon tea but it's not. These 40 count boxes are not packaged individually in foil packs but there are 4 tea bags in 1 foil pack and not resealable.  Therefore, if you're not a frequent tea drinker, the tea bags might loose freshness after you open the foil pack after a few days.  If you want individually packaged tea bags, you should look at the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).<br /><br />If I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than a minute, I will see loose tea particles on the bottom of my cup, leaving the last mouthful of tea undrinkable. This problem does not happen in the I Love Lemon tea by Bigelow even if I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than 10 mins.  I'm not sure if there's a same problem in the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) because I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />Taste wise - okay, same as any ordinary green tea.<br /><br />Drink for health benefits!",3

They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size; I only needed 24 beans, and ended up with closer to 50. However, my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream, creme brulee, tiramisu, custard, vanilla sugar, french toast, etc. I have recommended them to friends and family.",5

B002ZOCEVC,"This is probably fine if you like Maxwell House International Coffee and you drink your coffee with lots of sugar. But I was looking for a hint of vanilla, and this was far more than a hint. I made a pot, took two sips, and poured the rest down the drain.<br /><br />But the reason I'm giving it one star is that grinding six tablespoons of this left our Capresso burr grinder reeking of vanilla. That hasn't happened with other vanilla-flavored coffees we've tried. Running non-flavored beans through didn't cure it, nor did disassembling and cleaning it. The vanilla seems to have permeated some silicone parts that can't be cleaned, and it's flavoring other coffee we run through it, so we're buying a new grinder. That was a very expensive pot of coffee. :-(",1
B001LG945O,"Switch has been the first ""soda alternative"" that I've LOVED! It's got a delightful fresh fruit flavor, refreshing bubbles, and no aftertaste. It is sweet and juicy tasting, reminds me a little of Orange Crush. The tangerine flavor adds just the right note to peak your interest and overcome becoming just another orange drink. However, the price point of just at $1 a can prevents me from keeping it stocked in our home. Still, I would recommend it for an occasional treat.",5

B003GTR8IO,"I love vanilla flavored coffees. In fact, until I tried this one, there wasn't a vanilla flavored coffee I'd ever tried that I didn't like. But the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee was a major disappointment. I found this coffee to be very coarse tasting and bitter. Even using double the amount of creamer and sweetener I would use did not smooth down the grating roughness of this disaster. I tried to give it a fair shake and  used up half the bag before I couldn't take it anymore. I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor. So there you have it: Alone, it's a disappointing and practically unpalatable disaster; cut it with some average run-of-the-mill coffee and it can become pleasing enough to drink.",2

B002PO09MS,"Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through Amazon with thier subscribe and save program, otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own MMF. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff product from Michaels. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex, tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love the taste of this fondant too, I don't usually like fondant icings but this one is really good! The white is truely white too, not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/6/12<br />Lowering my stars from 5 to 3...<br />My first few batches of Fondarific were great, easy to work with, good taste, nice consistency etc. I use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own. I was totally sold on Fondarific until my last couple of orders. I didn't feel like dying fondant so I purchased the colored Fondarific for the first time(Pink and Red) so I'm not sure if that was the problem but they were REALLY soft. Like another reviewer I ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because I had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place. It was ridiculous like working with melting taffy. I live in Washington state and it was October so humidity was definitely not the problem. My last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat (even with cornstarch or shortening). So far both batches of black that I purchased were great and didn't have these issues. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product. If you get a good batch it is the BEST stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you. I may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but I will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they aren't up to snuff.",3

It was amazing, we would give these to guests and everyone said these were pretty good. Then we'd give them some Marconas and their faces would light up and say, ""The Cocoa almonds were good, but these are very good.""<br /><br />The Cocoa nuts have a nice rich chocolate flavor and crisp nuttiness. All in all they were good, but they didn't hold a light to the Marcona nuts. Maybe Emerald should make cocoa marconas.<br /><br />Once the Marconas were gone, our six year old made fairly regular covert trips to the kitchen to grab one of these.  So they were hit with him, although since his mom horded the Marconas to herself, he didn't know what he was missing.<br /><br />Definitely was a five star product before Marconas.",4

The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.

This tastes like they added heavy cream or sugar to it.<br />The pasta, it turns out, is orzo, which generally I do not like simply because the firmness of it is never quite right.<br /><br />Since you have to buy and prep the chicken separately anyway, I honestly would have been happier had I added chicken and frozen broccoli to the cheap store brand mac n cheese.

She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last.",3

Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially).<br /><br />I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:<br />""INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP""<br /><br />Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.",3
B001HTJ2BQ,Same experience as others here<br /><br />Been buying this stuff forever and had an active subscription as well.<br />Last shipment said product of Sri lanka and it's just awful compared to the original version from Thailand<br />The only thing that remained the same was the company name<br />Need to find another brand now<br />Very unhappy about this,2
B0045XE32E,"I thought the NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC LAMB AND BARLEY DOG TREATS were like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AEHN5A"">Newman's Own Organics Chicken and Rice Training Treats</a>, which are in stick form and easy to break, but these are thick and hard biscuits!<br /><br />My Shiba Inu is only 6-months old and weighs about 13-15 lbs. so she had a hard time chewing on the treat. I had to soak it in water a little bit and that allowed her to break off corners of the treat with her mouth and eat them that way. She seems to enjoy them, though, and they smell really good that I'm tempted to try one.<br /><br />The LAMB AND BARLEY BISCUIT TREATS are pretty big but they're scored so you can break them in half easily and they come in a resealable bag. Another issue is that the treats leave crumbs, but that may be my Shiba's fault, so it's best giving these treats on a hard surface rather than carpet.<br /><br />I posted some pics of the treats so you can get a sense of the scale.<br /><br />Otherwise, these snacks are made with only essential ingredients and skips the wheat and corn products, as well as the meat-by-products, and should provide a healthier alternative to other commercially made dog biscuits that have a bunch of fillers and chemicals in them.",4

Caramel apple pops fit the bill perfectly: 60 calories, and they last long enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br /><br />I went looking for these in local grocery stores and couldn't find them, but luckily Amazon saved the day. The pops came in the packaging that is shown in the picture but (as another reviewer pointed out) they look like they were home made. The pops vary in size, shape and mixture. However, it didn't really bother me and unless you NEED perfectly shaped pops with just the right combination of caramel and hard candy, I doubt it will bother you either.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended!

B004T72GUC,"I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012",5
B002LANN56,"It's hard for me to write a review for dog food because I'm never really sure what to say other than whether or not my dog liked it. She did like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm not sure, though, that it is the healthiest dog food out there, though I'm not as ""up"" on what ingredients are best for dogs, and what should be avoided. It does seem like there are a lot of filler/cheap ingredients instead of the truly nutritious ingredients one would want. The interesting thing about this particular dog food was the shape and texture. The ""meat"" pieces reminded me of the shape and texture of popcorn. I had never seen such a thing in a dog food before.",3

B0041NYV8E,"I am a huge lover of ginger.  I regularly drink ginger tea brewed from fresh ginger root (very inexpensive, yet tasty) and tea brewed from dried ginger.  Both those things are good and enjoyable.  So, when I saw this product I thought it'd be a great chance to enjoy ginger in yet another form.  I imagined it would taste very pleasantly enjoyable...  DID NOT HAPPEN!  This is one of the most disgusting and vile things I've tasted in a long time.  It had an incredibly overpowering bitter flavor to it - so much so that I re-checked the instructions to make sure I had added the correct amount of water (I had).  I couldn't make it past two sips before I just put it down and said ""enough of this madness!"".  I let my boyfriend try it too, and he said the same thing about the flavor - gross.  I know that different people have different tastes and all, and maybe there's someone out there that could stomach this, but I doubt it.  My personal advice to anyone who's checking this product out, just don't!  You'd be far happier just making some tea out of fresh or dried ginger root, an option that's cheaper than buying this crap anyways.  Ugh...that taste lingers in one's mouth, too...",1
B002C50X1M,"I was expecting some ""serious flavor"" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.",3

It is much better packaging with the foam insulation.<br /><br />The gift was ""assumed"" by the recipiant to be artificial (fake), which in this case was not a good thing.

I'm glad I ordered this six pack though so I didn't make the mistake of buying a three-pack of one of the flavors I didn't like. Here's what I thought of them:<br /><br />Vanilla - EXCELLENT! I've used this syrup in ice cream, coffee, diet cola, and even in a low-carb crepe recipe. It's really good and one that I will re-order on it's own.<br /><br />Hazelnut - Yummy, rich flavor. It's great in coffee. I would order this again.<br /><br />Raspberry - I loved this one also. It's great in coffee and berry smoothies.<br /><br />Chocolate - I liked this one but it is VERY STRONG. Literally, one drop in a glass of diet cola will make it into a chocolate coke. It's good, but you don't need much. It didn't work well in coffee.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I knew I wouldn't like this one so it remains unopened. I made a mistake of buying a three pack of this one once and hated it. I'll give it away to someone who will enjoy it.<br /><br />CLASSIC Caramel - I don't know why Torani insists on making ""Sugar Free Caramel Syrup"" and ""Sugar Free CLASSIC Caramel Syrup"". The Classic Caramel is terrible. After experimenting and trying to find a use for this syrup I just dumped it down the drain. It's not worth it. Avoid this one.",3
B0062A87HA,"There have been ongoing problems with dented and leaking cans with this product.  But my dogs HAVE to have it for their digestion, so I ordered a case somewhat reluctantly.<br /><br />In the first shipment I received, the cans were so badly dented that they looked like they had either been dropped from a considerable height or beaten with machetes.  One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE - and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage -- otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.<br /><br />Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.<br /><br />That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.  It's very watery, and there are black flecks throughout.  I wouldn't use it for pies, but the dogs don't seem to care and it does them no harm.",1

First off, these cuts are only one inch thick, which is ghastly offensive.  I steak should be, at the bare minimum, two inches thick.  I do not even associate with proletarians, and can only imagine the horrors that these ""people"" committ against decent food.  Can't these people just eat sensibly, or not at all.

My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-",1
B000IEDUB4,"I wanted to LOVE these but, I can't. Each type of veggie<br />CHIP should have its own NATURAL flavor..these have NO<br />FLAVOR.

B000AXSG0I,I bought this irish cream syrup for my hot milk I like to drink when it is cold. The syrup was good not to sweet but I thought it tasted more like coffee than irish cream.,4
B00469LSMU,a great deal. it arrived with no damage. the taste to me is the best. i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them. they just don't taste right to me. but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it. it tastes so good. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also.,5
B001LG945O,"I didn't read the label before I tried the drink, so I was a little surprised by the carbonation.  It had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation.  However, I've been a long-time drinker of the Tropicana Orange-Tangerine juice and Switch is simply not as good, IMHO.  If I wasn't already a Tropicana drinker, I might be interested in the Switch version of Orange-Tangerine, but I'm not going to ""switch"".  Sorry for the pun.",3
B0062A87HA,"We eat pumpkin on a regular basis and it gets hard this time of year when all of the stores are sold out.<br /><br />I saw reviews here on Amazon saying the cans were dented, but saw that someone from the manufacturer had responded so I figured the problem had been addressed.<br /><br />NOT SO.  I received a case of these cans and it was wrapped extremely well - bubble wrap all over the place.  However, the cans INSIDE the case were dented and damaged - I don't mean a little dented, I mean several of the cans had their entire sides caved in in such a way that I could not open one can and on another can I couldn't remove all the pumpkin because the can was smashed so badly.<br /><br />Those most damaged cans were packaged in the middle of the case - seemingly intentionally disguising how badly damaged they were.  The cans on the outside were relatively OK, ALL of them were dented a little - every single can - but the ones on the outside were MUCH less damaged than the ones on the inside.<br /><br />I don't see how this could have been accidental, although anything is possible.<br /><br />The quality of the pumpkin itself was good, but I don't like using damaged cans in case the food inside has been compromised.",1
B000FDKQC4,"I couldn't get these to work for muffins, so I decided to try the pancakes and wasn't disappointed. They come out perfectly raised every time. I like to make these without any sugar in the batter. The flax makes it very bitter, but I like them like that with lots of butter. However, if you just add some syrup on top, it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact. Give these a try!",5
B00213ERI0,"I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free ""bought"" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a ""case"" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual ""off taste"" that I've found in other cookies - there is no ""off taste"" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them ""yummy""!",5

B00139TT72,"I was using Organix for a while, and was happy with the ingredients, and my dog seemed to enjoy it. Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much - even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.<br /><br />So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.<br /><br />Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!",5
B001LGGH40,"The benefit of this drink is that it is ""no sugar added, 100% juice,"" which tastes basically like fruit soda.  I can see it as a good alternative to traditional soda, especially for kids and teens.  However, for adults I think the drink still tastes really sugary, despite the fact that sugar has not been added.  I ran for my toothbrush as soon as I was finished.  However, the taste is good and the kiwi berry was a nice flavor.  For young people with a sweet tooth I would recommend it, but I think grown ups will have a more difficult time jumping on board.",3
B003SPM64C,"I was disappointed because it was not like mochi that I have had (and enjoyed) in the past.  The rice cake and bean paste were of about the same consistency, and about equally sweet.  And it didn't have the nice flavor of either the rice cake or the bean paste.",1
B001EPQA5O,"Very tasty product. High Quality, Very good on toasted italian bread with olive oil and roasted garlic. I highly reccomend.",4

B006Q7YFLQ,"My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.<br /><br />I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.<br /><br />According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from ""minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients.""  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats.",4
B002IEZJMA,"It's strong coffee but not aggressively so.  Slightly sweet but again not over the top.  The can labels it ""Italian espresso style coffee drink"" which would lead me to expect it to be much stronger.<br /><br />The can says ""do not shake"" which I did so I'm not sure how that impacts the taste.  The can says it has 50 calories for the eight ounce can with 1% daily sodium, 4% carbohydrates, and 4% fiber.  Per the can it contains coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate; not a significant source of fat calories, saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, vitamin A,  vitamin C, calcium, iron.  It also states it's a Coca-Cola product made in Atlanta, Georgia, though it also says it's a product of Denmark.",3
B003TNANSO,"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"".

B005LMLXN0,"I usually don't drink tea because it doesn't have the caffeine kick I'm looking for, but guayusa tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. And unlike coffee, it doesn't need to be drowned in cream and sugar to taste good and doesn't have any of the other unpleasant side effects. I usually add about half a spoonful of sugar per cup, which is enough to pleasantly complement the natural flavor. Now if only Starbucks would start carrying guayusa...",5
B001E5E34E,This is the worst tasting tea ever. It really tastes just like cardboard and I am shocked that it doesn't have less stars. I recommend Celestial Seasoning Tea over this - tastes like real tea instead of packaging. You cannot return it either so don't bother buying it.,1
B0001VWDO4,It is very strong and pure! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor. Helps with digestion but the smell is strong!!,5
B00653KJ5M,"These taste very good, but aren't like the BEST things ever either. In order of my preference (gross to good) with explanation: The ""rainforest"" flavor one is my least favorites (I don't recommend this particular flavor). has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it (don't get me wrong, I love cayenne, but not in a cookie!).... The ""tropical"" one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version (not a bad taste. Really good, actually!)... the ""Original"" is very great. I forgot the taste though, but I remember liking it..... ""Alpine"", in my opinion, is the best - it tastes like a European type of christmas cookie. it has a chocolaty (carob) taste to it, but not overly-sweet.",4
B0006VB3TK,"It fits the right ball and it is just as ""everlasting"" as the other disks, but I really don't think this smells at all like vanilla or mint.",2
B004CYLW7A,"Have no fear, you CAN eat cereal that tastes just like those sweet cereals you ate as a kid without incurring the derision of spying neighbors. No more do you have to hide your Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Cookie Crisp in a Cheerios box, just buy these!<br /><br />(After finishing the box, I remember the cereal it tastes like: King Vitamin!)<br /><br />All kidding aside, this is a good (but not great) sweet cereal. Biggest plus is total lack of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup). This is sweetened with molasses and sugar. It is not too sweet and it is nicely crunchy. And like most fortified breakfast cereals it contains 25% of a lot of the vitamins you need daily.<br /><br />It's not a great source of protein or fiber. But on the flip side, it's not carb heavy or high in calories (for what it is). And to be honest, there's no great nut taste even if peanuts are the 4th ingredient. And I don't get honey from it either.<br /><br />So to wrap up: sweet crunch: yes. great nutrition: no. Probably not worth 7$+ a box, but it is probably cheaper at your grocery store. Worth a try, but it probably won't be your favorite.",3
B0013OXEC8,"This is a very good tasting tea that steeps nicely into a light colored beverage. However, about 50% of the bags had tears in them or were otherwise unsealed.  I would buy again only as loose tea, as that is basically what came.  :-)",3

My wife prefers the sweeter fruitier teas, such as Republic of Tea's Kiwi Pear, and I generally go for traditional blacks, Prince of Wales, Oolongs, etc. But this tea is perfect for both of us! I always liked good vanilla teas, and some coconut teas always blew me away as well. Our pals at Steep Tea still make some of the best teas in around, so we were pretty game to try this Lana's tea - it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys'.<br /><br />Anyway, there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we couldn't pin down until one of our pals pointed out ""This smells like Bailey's!"" Bingo. Need I go on?",5
B001EPQ10S,Copper Moon Costa Rican coffee is a very full flavored coffee and not at all acidic. It is a medium roast just as described.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee that you can honestly taste.

B001O2IX8E,"The other reviews are very outdated & old. We never had any issues with the quality of this product. My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth's best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it.",5

It was from Sri Lanka. It is a thin product that becomes greasy when heated. It lacks the thick rich taste I'm used to from Native Forest. Very disappointed. I only gave it a 2 star because of the BPA free can. I'd like to rate Amazon a zero for not listening to us complain.",2

Its actually drinkable but it is very sweet (I never put sugar in my tea or coffee).<br />You can smell and taste the ""vitamins"". To me the smell is a little worse than the taste but overall not bad.<br /><br />As for the caffeine you can tell there is some. There was a slight energy boost.<br />No jittery feeling. But not enough caffeine to stand up to others.<br /><br />Also, too much sugar for me.",3
B000E21Z7Q,"I'm floored by the negative reviews.  I started eating these about 6 months ago and am addicted. This item is a blend between crunch and a bit of sweet.  Yes, they are a bit gritty but I never opt back to regular stick pretzels so that isn't a real noticable issue for me.  I saw Dr. Oz introducing new foods to some people one day and he reminded them to taste and evaluate on the item, not as a comparision to what they were used too.  That may be why some folks do not like these.  I love these so much I'm buying in bulk.  But I have changed my eating habits 180 degrees so maybe that's why I love them.  I never go back to the old way I ate as comparision, and have no lingering desires for the junk food flavor.",5

B002QWP89S,"My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much.",4

Also, ghee can be stored at room temperature, best away from light.<br /><br />My complaint is the cost.  It is twice as expensive as butter. For those who need to stay away from milk (dairy) products and don't want to heat olive oils, etc., use of ghee may be worth the price.",4

Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though.",1
B005CUU25G,"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.",2
B005V9ZB8Q,"The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005V9ZB8Q"">Walkers Shortbread Dark Chocolate, Ginger Royals, 4.4-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> arrived in time for dessert so I was very excited to immediately open the package and break out the cookies to serve with vanilla ice cream.  The chocolate had clearly been melted at some point, with a muted color, irregular coating, sticking to the packaging.  These cookies were very unsuccessful and a great disappointment. My Dad loved the two types of Walkers shortbread cookies I brought to him, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQ18K"">Walkers Shortbread Lemon Thins, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLVI"">Walkers Shortbread Assorted, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, so these were much anticipated for a dark chocolate and ginger lover.  They were absolutely lousy and ended up in the trash.  The cookies were extremely chewy, sticking to the teeth, but I'm not sure if this is the nature of the cookies or simply the batch we received.  We opened each box, finding all cookies in the same condition -- messed up chocolate sticking to the package, cookies overtly sticky.  If I can find these in a b&m store, I'll update, but won't order online again. Trader Joe's triple ginger cookies have a better texture and taste so we'll have a piece of dark chocolate with those for the desired combination. I may try dipping those cookies in melted bittersweet chocolate, leaving an edge free for easy holding.",2

There are probably around 12 cookies in 1 pack.  These cookies are a bit too sweet for me but I'm the type of person that doesn't eat too much sweets.  The chocolately cocoa crackers are very crunchy, not too hard, not too soft and the filling is like a marshmallow texture but it's not marshmallow, it's a creamy vanilla filling.  It doesn't ooze out when you take a bite into it. (That's a plus for me because it keeps my hands clean.)  Overall, very good.  They should make them in low-cal and low-fat versions. :)",4

B001LG940E,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the ""Shasta Black Cherry"" soda that I drank occasionally as a kid, although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike the ""Shasta Black Cherry,"" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 130 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created 12 ounce cans and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.",3

However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?",1

B0041NYV8E,"In quite a lot of the world, ginger is used as a quasi-medicinal agent in foods and beverages.  It's delicious and adds a pit of heat to everything from curries to hot tea.  I've been a fan for some time, but frankly, ginger is kind of a pain to deal with on a ""casual"" basis - it dries out if not consumed fairly quickly, it's difficult to peel and it's not always available at the local grocery store.<br /><br />I especially miss it in a late night tea.  There's something about it I find relaxing, and this product fills that need without a lot of mess.  The lemon / ginger / honey bland tastes great.  The Gold Kili brand is widely touted as a digestion aid (as ginger is in general), and though I can't claim any problems with digestion (!), I do like to brew a bit to enjoy with Thai or Indian food.  My only complaint about his product is that it's a bit on the expensive side (as I write this.)  Otherwise, it's definitely worth a try.",4

After further searching on the Amazon website, to find a way to return a damaged product, and not having any luck, I gave up.

My Grandson loves it for his snak but I dont give it to him on a regular basis as I think its got too much sugar for a regular diet. All and all I think this is as good as any presweetened cereal I have had but I couldnt eat it more than a couple times a month.

B004BLQ45O,"The FedEx truck just dropped off my shipment about 10min ago. I couldn't help myself but open up the Cookies & Cream pint right away.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the top was REALLY hard to open. I had to almost rip it to get it opened. Actually I did rip one side of the cover.<br />The second thing I noticed was the color, it looks like a light colored black bean mush. Yeah, I know weird right?<br />But I mustered on.<br /><br />Picked up my spoon and tried to dig in. And tried and tried ... nope, the spoon only made a teeny tiny dent. So I nuked it for about 15secs. Finally I was able to get a taste.<br />Hmmm... can't really figure out what the taste actually is. Really, I'm not joking. It definitely does not taste like C&C. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible or extremely unpleasant but definitely NOT C&C. It also has an after taste. I wish I could pinpoint what it tastes like but I really can't. Sorry.<br /><br />Then the last thing I noticed was after I nuked it for 15 sec, the melty product was a bit stringy. Rather strange.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in the C&C flavor.  I haven't given up on this product line yet because:<br />1. It has 32% of your fiber in the whole pint.<br />2. On a bad day with the kids, I can see wanting to eat a whole pint of ice cream by myself and this might just save me from that.<br />3. You'll work off the calories you eat just by scooping the frozen ""ice cream"" from the container... :D<br /><br />On to the Strawberry.<br />I finally had a chance to try it after it sits in our freezer for a couple days. I found that I had to let it sit on the counter for awhile again before I could scoop it out.<br />The taste is a little bit better than the C&C. It has a tiny bit of the strawberry taste but definitely not like strawberry ice cream in any way or form.<br />It's more the consistency of a sorbet than ice cream.<br /><br />I probably will try the other flavors to see if there is one that I could strongly recommend. However, if these are the only 2 flavors available I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone based on the taste and cost.",3

B000FKL0EU,"Altoids wintergreen mints were once my favorite flavor of altoids. They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list ""color (blue 1)"" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.<br /><br />July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color ""blue 1"", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!",1

B004JRKEH4,"I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, ""Flavored mayonnaise"".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, ""Yo no quiero Taco Bell"".<br /><br />Not recommended.",3

Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet-about as sweet as the sweetest breakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.<br /><br />I would not go so far as to call this a ""wholesome"" breakfast.

The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be.

It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like peanut butter AT ALL. Zero peanut butter taste. How does a company get away with such blatant false advertisement like this.

B003SRWR5I,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.

B004JRKEH4,"I'm going to resist the urge to say it's not hot enough, because I don't care; some things are very hot, and good or bad, and some things are milder, and good or bad.

If the basic flavor is all right, you can always add peppers with no harm done.<br /><br />I had tried the Taco Bell Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce and liked it quite a bit, more as an ingredient than straight. I do not think this is as good. It does have a bit of smoke flavor, and that's pleasant, but I find it has a noticeable artificial taste that was missing from the jalape&ntilde;o sauce. It's almost a rubber-like taste (not texture--that's fine), and I'm not sure how much it would have to be diluted to make it go away. We tried it straight on tacos, and while my husband said it was good enough, it still tasted a bit like a tire to me. I'm not sure whether this means I am a delicate and sensitive flower, or that he is an oblivious lout with no sense of nuance. I will allow that I might have been looking for it after taking a taste directly from the bottle--not the best idea I've ever had.<br /><br />I'll work with it some more to see if I can find a dish it goes with well; it's not a total loss, and we'll finish the bottle--eventually.",3

B007RTR8AM,The main problem with the product is that it leaked a lot in transit.  Luckily it's packaged very well so the package didn't arrive dripping but it was a mess to clean.

The fresh, crisp almonds are beautifully complimented by their coating of cocoa.  They're lightly sweet, too.  Just enough to give you the full flavor of both chocolate and nut.  The only problem I have with them is that they're sweetened with sucralose, which is an artificial sweetener, and which may or may not be good for us.  There doesn't appear to be a great deal of it in the mix -- it's the last listed ingredient -- but for some it might be a problem.<br /><br />As with the Marcona almonds I tried earlier, these nuts have persuaded me to think of Emerald as a better brand than I originally thought.

B002BCE9JS,"I knew it was a pipe dream to think this product would be 'good' pho, but as an avid pho lover, I had to try it. The verdict? It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of ""pho"". It still isn't quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done.",3

B001CPUPMA,I have little yorkies so I generally take products like this and cut into smaller portions.  This stuff was so hard if you tried to snap in half it crumbles away a big portion of the piece.<br />I finally put it on a cutting board and when I tried to cut with a meat clever I got scared the knife was gonna slip sideways.  The pieces still crumbled.  I mean we are talking serious dry.<br />This product is touted as quality and american.  This product is much more expensive yet is the worst I've ever purchased.  It is like it was outdated.<br /><br />Do not buy this product.  It is poor value,1

I will keep it and try using it as a flavoring in cooking.",2

B004JRKEH4,"In order to get some valid feedback, I offered this new sauce to four teenage boys who love eating at Taco Bell.  Not one of them liked it. Their comments ranged from ""Too smoky"", ""Tastes like French dressing that went bad"" to ""It leaves an aftertaste"". I was quite surprised by their responses. In order to fairly evaluate the product, I added it to my own turkey and cheese sandwich wrap. (It is not a low-cal condiment.) I'm sorry to say...I agree wholeheartedly with the boys. Perhaps this product is better suited for just tacos and not sandwiches or salads. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this product.",1
B001AJ1ULS,"My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.

In fact I wonder, how weak must Gevalia's mild brews must be.<br /><br />I was excited about the variety of coffees when I purchased my Tassimo but so far I have been disappointed by all except the Starbuck's blends (which are pricier).  I made a special trip to the US to purchase a few packages of these since many comments pointed towards a comparable alternative to the Starbucks.<br /><br />Having gone through a few now, I'd argue that it's the same as the Nabob Morning Roast sold in Canada.<br /><br />Now back to the size argument, if you had an extra 3oz to the Starbuck's house blend, you will have much richer tasting 12 oz cup of medium roast coffee.",2

I was hopeful this digestive support treat would work out. I gave him one a week for 4 weeks and every time, within 12 hours, an incident followed. Though I can't directly connect the two (treat=incident), 4 timing  coincidences was enough for me to stop short of giving him the last 2 treats.<br /><br />He LOVED them ... which is why I gave them two, and not one, stars.

B00139C3P2,"Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors.",3

I ended up splitting one packet into 4 mugs of usage and it ended being perfect. A great lemony taste w/ a huge bite of ginger aftertaste. Even diluted to 4 mugs, it was still a bit strong.

B000V1D19A,I just made this and it was quite good. I added sweet onions and mushrooms which really added depth to the dish. I'm sure this would taste great plain as well.

Try making some homemade naan bread to go along with it.,4

I was very excited to try this since I do not drink regular milk and I wanted a nutrient rich substitute for cow's milk to give my 1 year old son.  My review is not based on taste. I've never tasted this product and it arrived faster than estimated.

Nonetheless, You can research it for yourselves and make your own choice.",1

I was most surprised when first drinking this beverage mix, added to hot water, at the strength of the flavor and the bite it leaves on the tongue.  There is nothing tepid about it.  However, if the drink is too strong for your taste, it can be weakened, but still taste good, by putting it on ice.<br /><br />The flavor of the honey and lemon is easily distinguishable.  So you have to be a lover of ginger in liquid form to really appreciate this instant drink.  I like the fact there are no bags, it's easy to prepare.  You just pour.<br /><br />It's really up to one's individual taste as to whether or not this drink will be appealing.

They're a great treat, even if the temptation is to keep popping one in your moouth after the other.<br /><br />The problem here is that a single package doesn't travel well.  Consider the way a lot of boxes can be tossed around in mail and UPS trucks and you start to get an idea as to the problem.  About half of the cookies that were in my shipment were either broken or crumbly.  That kind of detracts from things.  And before you have images of some small package delivery guy tossing the box every which away, this wasn't that kind of damage.  This was the kind of crumbing and breakage that's almost unavoidable in a small carton... IF... it's going to be shipped through any method other than a shrink wrapped pallet.

B005YYFHCS,"I purchased these for their ""0 effective carb"" rating, but was surprised to see that they actually have 7 carbs of erythritol per can. However, the can claims that the carbs don't impact blood sugar, and I believe that must be true, because though I am new to low-carb dieting, these did not move me out of ketosis, even though I had approximately 20g carbs from other sources for a given day.<br /><br />I liked most of the flavors in this variety pack, but will probably just focus on one or two in the future, since they weren't all hits for us. Also, it felt weird drinking a clear grape soda, but I appreciate that they don't use artifical colors. Over all, I would buy this product again, just probably not the variety pack, but it is good if you want an experiment in flavor options.<br /><br />On a final note, the ""Mountain Zevia"" and grapefruit flavors are not returnable at our local (Oregon) automatic recycling center, because their bar codes are difficult for the scanner to read, but this is just a minor issue in general.",3

After reading other reviews here, I realize that it must be the sucralose.  I consider it not only very misleading advertisting for each cup not to be labeled as ""diet"" in some way, but sucralose also happens to be my least favorite of the major artificial sweeteners.  I don't know what the calorie count on these things would be, but if it happens to be low then I'd recommend trying this only if you're dieting and really desperate.

While they are quite tasty (yes, I will be finishing the bag!), the expectation was that there was actually going to be pomegranate as the main ingredient. The name is misleading and, like many food companies, this seller is jumping on the bandwagon of adding the smallest amount of the fruit in the mix and using its name in the title. The pomegranate juice concentrate is mixed with several other fruit juices, and there is no indication on the package of how much pomegranate is actually in there. Trader Joe's version is actual pomegranate arils covered in a small amount of chocolate - definitely could qualify as a ""healthier"" treat option. These, unfortunately, do not. Quite tasty, but don't kid yourself on any health benefits here - too much sugar! FYI: 180 calories and 26 grams of sugar in Â¼ cup (about 16-20 nuggets).",3

I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement.

The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies ""best if eaten by date"" was only 2 days after I received them!

The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.",3

My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).<br /><br />Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).<br /><br />My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.

B004ZIER34,"Puroast Low Acid Coffee<br />If all you want is low acid, try other beverages. With Data.<br />To start with I do experience occasional heartburn, reflux, etc, so this was a very exciting taste test. I brewed a pot of fairly well renowned regular coffee, and a pot of Puroast. I poured both into identical cups, no milk or sugar to start with. The regular coffee had a deep brown color, while the Puroast had a black brown color. I tested the pH of both, the regular was about 5-5.5 while the Puroast was indeed 7.0 or neutral as claimed. First taste was of the Puroast as I did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste. Good grief... It was wet, it was warm, very flat taste with no finish, hardly what I would call even an average cup of coffee. The best comparison is that to a day old coffee that has been left to evaporate and oxidize. Perhaps burned charcoal aroma with hints of bitter chocolate and caramel? The standard coffee by comparison had a rich coffee aroma, and the taste was wonderfully balanced coffee bean with tinge of vanilla, and a pleasant finish with a slight kick (the balance finish kick is unfortunately from the acid).<br /><br />I now added some whole milk, and as expected the regular coffee mellowed out a bit, but all of the wonderful flavor still came across. Incredibly when I added milk to the Puroast, it turned a poor tasting cup into an awful tasting cup. The flavor now became that of  mostly spoiled milk! This was such a strange sensation that I had three more people confirm the sour milk phenomenon. To top things of, the color had now become that of black brown mud.<br /><br />So all in all, this was a bad experience. If you have a need to drink a low acid coffee do this. Get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead.",1

B000X1Q1G8,"I was so excited to see this product because, as another poster mentioned, I tend to eat way too much regular peanut butter! I spread some on half of a pita and some fruit preserves on the other half, and the taste was terrible. They did try to make it nutty, but it almost had a really salty taste to it. It probably wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, and I will try to make myself tolerate it, but it just isn't good.",2
B003VXFK44,"I bought this grudgingly because my favorite Timothy's Italian Blend was out of stock...... and I was very happily surprised! It's not as ""big""  and winey a brew as my favorite, but was flavorful, had a delicious aroma and was smooth. I tend to like rather potent coffee but I have clients who prefer a little lighter cup..... this will be perfect! I will happily keep buying this coffee. Thanks Wolfgang!",5
B004HOLD92,"These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.

B0016PKA1C,"My wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism I gave it a try. It seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the ""seal the deal"" moment was when I put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where I mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later (we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation) I opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. I doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy $10 to justify.<br /><br />It's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods.",5
B003CK2BQG,"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~",3

B0012XBD7I,"Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.",3

B005K4Q37A,"I do enjoy Hazelnut flavored creamers as well as french vanilla creamers in my coffee, I know the flavors aren't exact but  since I enjoyed them in coffee I might like them in cappuccino as well.  I love the french vanilla flavored variety they sell, so much so I've had to purchase additional (early) shipments from subscribe-n-save.  Unfortunately the hazelnut isn't so great, and not b/c it's 'convenient store' cappuccino either.  I prefer that over 'real' stuff.  It smells wonderful, but just something in the flavor that's lacking and it leaves a weird after taste.  Just wish I didn't buy the 36 count.  Definately buy the French Vanilla variety if you are trying to choose between the two.",2
B00196U7OI,"I was looking for some nutritious snacks - with fiber - and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal/flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked, but there is no ""artificial"" taste at all. They're generous in size (3-4 inches diameter, almost an inch high) and though not calorie lightweights (120-140 each depending on the variety), they have 3-4 grams of fiber each. Highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast.",5

B000KFU6RW,"I love Green tea, I love Pomegranate, and I love flavored teas.  The reviews were good so I bought this based on that information.<br /><br />But I cannot gag this stuff down.  It looks very appealing in the cup and smells like it should taste good, but I really really do not like it.  I tried it for several days thinking it must be one of those aquired tastes, but it is still really gross to me.<br />I ended up giving the entire case away to a neighbor who did sort of like it.... so it isn't ALL bad.  Must just be me.<br /><br />In my opinion -- if you have not tried it, find someplace that sells it and give it a try before you buy a whole case.",2
B001LGGH40,"This flavor of this drink is the better of them. Really nice and sweet. Not overdone, not weak, just right. My only complaint with these drinks is that they are carbonated. I wish they weren't. But if I had to choose between this and the other... I would choose this flavor again.",4

B000CRHQN0,"My husband kept buying boxes of these to take to work (thinking it was a good thing) so I also tried them.  Every flavor tastes awful with the peanut butter being the least awful.<br /><br />The worst part, though, is we both GAINED weight and his cholesterol went through the roof.  That is when I checked the ingredients to note that, though sugar free, they are very high in fat - 8 grams of fat per bar!  And this is a bad fat because after my husband stopped eating these, his bad cholesterol went back down.<br /><br />Bottom line is there is NO substitute for eating a sensible, healthy diet of REAL FOOD and getting exercise.  No such thing as a meal in a pre packaged bar that is healthy and certainly not these.  If I am going to eat something unhealthy (as these are) it better taste really good to be worth the sacrifice.",1

B000FBQ594,"These are decent cookies when bought at a discount from Amazon. They're light and not too sweet, but unfortunately are pretty crumbly. While it's nice that Bahlsen doesn't use trans fat, the hydrogenated filling has the cheap and greasy consistency of Crisco, and is loaded with saturated fat. Palm oil would make these a little healthier, butter would make them taste much better, but alas manufacturers must always use the cheapest ingredients possible. Since Bahlsen's price is much more reasonable than other manufacturers, and since they are superior to most brands (except the crumbs!), they are worth considering.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim these have a hazelnut filling have sensitive palates. While these cookies may or may not contain traces of hazelnuts, their filling tastes mundanely of cocoa.",3

B0040WHJQM,"For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles. However, if you're not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all.",3

B004MO6NI8,"THE CAN: The can itself says it's a ""Super Energy, Supplement"". Nothing about which flavor it is or is not. Sounds like they are trying to market to those that are addicted to 5 Hour Energy, Liquid Energy Berry, 2-Ounce (12 Pack) shots and the like.<br /><br />SMELL: Yes, I wanted to know how it smelled before I drank it. It completely smelled like I was about to drink a grapefruit drink. I'm personally okay with that but know others may not be too excited and wonder if it would have a bitter bite to it like grapefruit.<br /><br />TASTE: I was pleasantly surprised! Drinking the other brands there is always this ""bite"" that makes them sometimes hard to drink. This has the best flavor of them all!! And it did NOT taste like grapefruit, but sort of a fruit punch flavor.<br /><br />COST: Currently at $2.33 per can on Amazon (includes shipping), I guess the prices is average. But for about the same price I could get a grande house coffee with an extra shot of espresso from the overpriced Starbucks. I would still get a boost from Starbucks AND with less ingredients going into my body.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: First three ingredients are: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid.<br />Really? The cheapest and one of the worst product to put in your body is, HFCS.<br />An easy Google search on the health dangers of HFCS will reveal that HFCS is related to health problems as weight gain, dental cavities, poor nutrition, and increased triglyceride levels, which can boost your heart attack risk. No thanks!<br /><br />The print on the can was very difficult to read, so I couldn't really tell you what other ingredients are in this thing. It does have an allergen warning of ""Contains Soy"".<br /><br />ENERGY BOOST: I'm use to having one(1) cup of coffee a day at that. So when I drank this I was wired within 15 minutes. It definitely had the boost!!<br /><br />OVERALL: Still nothing replaces healthy eating, exercise and a good night's rest for living a high energy life. But since we don't always get that, a supplement such as this drink does come in handy.<br />It taste great and gives a good boost, but at the cost of damaging ingredients.",3

It tasted very similar to regular Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, but no matter how little I tried cooking the pasta I could not get it to an al dente state such that the noodles didn't fall apart as soon as I started stirring to create the cheese sauce.  I think the last time I made it I cooked the noodles for 5 1/2 minutes (the box recommends 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 minutes) and they still fell apart.

So, it was with hesitation that I tried the vanilla ground coffee. I did not expect much, but I also really went into it with a hopeful attitude that this time it would taste delicious.  Unfortunately, my previous experiences held up to be true once again.  The taste was bitter and sharp, not smooth and had a yucky ""fake"" taste.  I will say that the vanilla flavoring tasted more natural than some flavored coffees that I have tried, but it still wasn't great.  I'm really not a coffee snob and will drink just about anything else (!), so I hate to sound so negative, but this was my opinion of the product.",2
B0000CEPDP,I'm not convinced on this brand yet but we are trying it. A crf cat needs low protein and low phosphorous. The data on this from Tanya's guide for Crf cats shows this has pretty high phosphorous for a renal food.  .72% vs .38% on the K/D. Also has 36% protein vs. 28% with the K/D. Its more equal to senior formula foods than the prescription foods. It might not be the best choice. It does have high fat though vs other brands which is my hope for keeping some weight on my 18 year old crf cat.,3

B0018CJZ64,"As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.

However, I was disappointed when I realized that one of the 6 boxes of tea in there was Peppermint and not actually Morning Thunder.

The only problem is sometimes I get the seeds stuck in my teeth! They have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin. The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry. Within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet I have noticed my insides are thanking me. Golden berries are naturally very anti-inflammatory. They have an addicting flavor that I will gladly continue to feed into.",5

B00120U5DY,"This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It's very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.",2
B000PDY3P0,"Packaging is very easy to open, for me it does taste a little too salty but still enjoyable. I have a 6oz. popcorn maker however when I use the entire packet towards the end it want's to pop off the top so I may try the 4oz. next time. The only complaint I have is when I received this package due to the extreme heat we have had this summer by the time I received it some of the packets the oil/butter had leaked through and was a little messy as I had to wipe off each packet and throw away a couple.",4

B003GYZBK6,"The Butterfinger has been around since it was introduced by the Curtiss Candy Company of Illinois in 1923. In the 1990s, they put a new wrinkle on the trademark by making Butterfinger BBs. Those were good, but they really outdid themselves when they invented the Butterfinger Crisp! The Butterfinger Crisp is made of baked wafers sandwiching layers of Butterfinger flavored cream. Then, the whole thing is wrapped in chocolate.<br /><br />Yeah, this candy bar is great, a real improvement on the original. It has that same great Butterfinger taste, but without that stick-to-teeth consistency. If anything it even tastes better! The normal-sized Butterfinger Crisp contains 210 calories, but a nice thing is that it comes in the form of two bars, which allows you to eat one as a (roughly) 100 calorie snack and save the other one for tomorrow's snack. I wish that they did that with other candy bars.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like Butterfingers, or if you like wafer-candy, then you will like Butterfinger Crisps. Go for it!",5
B000V1D19A,"This is very easy to use and it is good.  It is not as good as the butter chicken curry.  It is good with onions - I like it heavy on onions and bell peppers and just a bit of chicken - about 1 cup cut up.  It does complement rice well.<br />I can really taste the cinnamon in this one, and that keeps the balance off just enough to make it good and enjoyable, but not GREAT.",4
B00213ERI0,These cookies are the best.  They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream.  The reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something I can't taste at all; these are yummier than all the wheat-based commercial sugar cookies I've tasted.,5
B001KQM74K,"I'm a sucker for cinnamon, so of course I had to try the Cinnamon Matcha. It smells so good. Sooooo good. Not like fake cinnamon hearts (which I adore too), but like real cinnamon. I want to slather this matcha on toast...but that would be weird. This is another matcha that inspires me to bake. Matcha snickerdoodles? Don't mind if I do! I need to start actually trying some of these recipe ideas. Like cinnamon matcha cinnamon toast! Or a cinnamon matcha apple pie! Nom nom nom.<br /><br />At first sip, it was delicious. At second sip, it was delicious. At third sip...well, you get the idea. There is something I don't care for about it, a bit of a tangy aftertaste, but that's not enough to keep me from drinking it! I'm excited to see how it will taste when blended with the vanilla. Ooooh, I should see if they have an apple matcha, that would be yummy mixed with this. Or pear! Oh dear, my list of desired matchas is growing longer and longer...<br /><br />But really, I just want to dump a whole mess of sugar into this and make some cinnamon raisin toast. And bake my little heart out! I think this is a matcha I will end up mixing more than making straight, but that's okay. I am seeing a wide world of possibilities coming from this little beauty. Cinnamon and I were good friends before, but I think is safe to say that this tea has pushed us over the edge into best friend territory. Plays well with others, makes me feel better, and encourages me to eat tasty, tasty sweets! I can see this becoming a staple in my cupboard, sitting right next to my beloved vanilla.",4

The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed. Maybe then I'll get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive. My vote is G/F with Betty C!",2
B001EO5NIA,"This may be labeled a medium roast but the cups it brews more closely resemble dirty water. It takes a lot of grounds to brew a cup that has any flavor at all. I generally enjoy light and medium roasts, and when this is brewed correctly there is a decent if unremarkable flavor. But I have to pack the filter to get any taste at all. I do appreciate the lower caffeine content, as I generally enjoy an extra cup of coffee in the afternoon. I can't recommend this - following the directions on the label produces undrinkable coffee.",2

B006BXUVPY,"The good thing about a cheese like cheddar is that is packs a lot of flavor in it.  This translates well to secondary products like crackers.  Mozzarella - not so much.  Mozzarella is so mild that when you try to put it into a product like a cracker, it will inherently have a too mild flavor, so you'll need to enhance this somehow.  The easy thing would be to add salt, but Kellogg decided to use spices.  This makes the product taste closer to ""Ranch dressing"" more than cheese.<br /><br />The product is also marked as ""Creamy & Mild"".  True enough but just what the heck do they use to make a cracker taste ""creamy""???  It is kind of weird to me.<br /><br />I'll stick with the original.",3
B002IEZJMA,Found this to be very strong and bitter tasting. Also I'm not used to drinking espresso as a cold drink so it was a strange experience for me. Can't really recommend this as I didn't finish the can. On the good side it's marked as being only 50 calories.,3

You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD ""It just sounds more alive""---she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about.",5

The two of them love, love this dry food and I have to ration it or they would chow day all day. I don't leave food out for any pet, cat or dog, to eat at will.

B0002UM1AA,"I am in love with everything rose. I wear rose lotion ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087L6T"">Rose Milk Skin Care Lotion - 8 fl oz</a>), I burn rose candles (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00069ZDJS"">Yankee Candle Large 22-Ounce Jar Candle, Fresh Cut Roses</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEWDH6"">Votivo Aromatic Candle Rush Of Rose</a>), I use rose lip balm (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049XKXRY"">Rose Love Balm (Limited Edition) - 15ml/0.5oz</a>) and I drink rose tea (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTRI"">Teas' Tea Rose Green Unsweetened Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>.) I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I"">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4"">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO"">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on ""a bouquet of roses and a box of candy"", I highly recommend these rose preserves!",4

When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha, I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy, like nutmeg and cloves. It wasn't unpleasant, just totally unexpected. The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste, where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty, rich pistachio flavor. The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor, and I can't help but wonder if the spiciness isn't at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground. Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink!",4

Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!",5

B007K449CE,"Well don't REALLY join me in my shower - just virtually join me while I describe this shampoo. It's thick and rich enough that a little is all you need to use, and it stays in your palm until you smack it on your noggin and start scrubbing. I also give points for the bottle design, which is easy to grip, squeeze, and close with one hand.<br /><br />Despite being an anti-dandruff shampoo, it doesn't feel harsh - nor does it have a medicinal smell. In fact, despite some reviews mentioning the perfuming ingredients, I didn't really pick up a strong scent at all.<br /><br />As far as its ability to control dandruff and flaking, I'm not particularly knocked out. Perhaps it's effective if such flaking is only from dry skin, as the shampoo seems like more of a moisturizer than medication. But for that same reason, it leaves my hair feeling slightly greasy (albeit looking nice). Overall not a bad shampoo, but not my first choice for actual treatment of an active dandruff problem.",2

B0041CIR62,"We're Gluten Free, so we eat rice noodles on a regular basis. Whenever I see a new brand come along I usually give it a try and most of the time they aren't as good as Tinkyada <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4P5UK"">Tinkyada Brown Rice Pasta, Spaghetti, Organic, 12-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, and this product is no different.<br /><br />First off, I never follow the instructions on noodles - I cook them all the same way I was taught by my mother...boil the water, put them all in with a bit of salt (oil optional) and test them until the right texture is achieved. I did the same with these - I'm not up for soaking, or  boiling water, putting in noodles then letting it sit off the burner for ""x"" amount of time or any of that. So, that may make a difference. Anyways...<br /><br />Many of the noodles were broken, so be aware of that if ordering vs. picking them out yourself in a store. I personally don't like noodles so thin - they are harder to work with and to me just don't contribute much to the overall meal. However, I do like the really thin rice noodles used for Pad Thai, Pho and dishes such as that and they cook super quick as well! My favorite of those are: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CRKNPK"">GLUTEN FREE Vietnamese Brown Rice Noodles with Organic Green Tea - JUST NOODLES, 8.6 oz, 4 SERVINGS per box (Pack of 6)</a> These are very long and skinny, cook really quick, and an be used like spaghetti noodles or in any way you might want to use noodles. I suggest you buy those instead.<br /><br />My suggestion is to go with Tinkyada noodles for any type of ""regular"" noodle dishes you need, and the Just Noodles <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CRKNPK"">GLUTEN FREE Vietnamese Brown Rice Noodles with Organic Green Tea - JUST NOODLES, 8.6 oz, 4 SERVINGS per box (Pack of 6)</a> whenever you need super quick cooking noodles or for Asian, Thai, etc. type dishes.

My main concern with this product is that these do not have much, if any, ""cocoa"" or ""dark chocolate"" flavor like they advertise. It's just a very light dusting of powder on each almond, and the taste really doesn't stand out. The almonds themselves are fine, and I've never had any real issues with any of Emerald's line of canned nuts. So if you're looking for a relatively healthy snack item, these would satisfy your cravings. Just don't expect a burst of chocolate flavor.",3
B0018CJJ9W,"My Black Russian Terrier has had chronic vomiting and dry heaves for six years. Multiple vet visits and and a trip to MedVet for a thorough workup could not pinpoint the cause. I tried many meds/supplements/foods to try to solve this problem with no results. After seeing the reviews of this food I decided to try it even though the price is outrageous - desperate times call for desperate measures! Titan's vomiting and dry heaves have decreased dramatically since being on this food (he's been on it for about 1.5 months now). Yay! Since it worked so well for him, I decided to try it on one of my other dogs, a PBGV with major stinky anal gland issues. Even though I hadn't read any reviews about this food working for that, I thought it was worth a shot. I was told that more fiber in his diet might help to bulk up his stool and this food seemed to have more fiber. Jack has been on this food for about a month now and we haven't had any stinky anal gland issues so far. My only issue with this food is the price (a 110-pound dog goes through it like crazy).

B004YV80OE,"Okay. It's a Velveeta skillet dinner; we're not talking about a four-star prix fixe experience in Paris. My expectations were fairly low: it only had to taste pretty good. The included, freeze-dried broccoli florets were dusty and powdery; they didn't add much to the dish's flavor or appearance. The included seasoning had a kind of unusually sweet flavor to it, which I found initially interesting but was ultimately displeasing. The pasta was more like orzo (large rice, basically).<br /><br />It's a hyper-tasty meal: it has plenty of fat and carbohydrates (and, if you elect to add chicken - protein) per serving. Each serving isn't particularly large, either; I could easily eat two, though at 390 calories, I don't think I'd want to. It's inexpensive - a bonus! - but isn't a good choice as a staple. For an occasional, easily-prepared indulgence, though, it's a good venture and can be a welcome change from spaghetti.",3

Maybe it's a better product for cooking, but not for smoothies. I tasted a little on its own and the alcohol base is what overwhelmingly stood out to me over any vanilla flavor. I'm going to keep looking. Hoping to find something natural with a big vanilla bang for my buck and little to no added chemicals. Fingers crossed!",2
B000FKIYEO,"I just purchased some of these mints at the store. They don't have that great of a taste and they aren't strong at all until you bite into them, and then the mint flavor quickly disappears and doesn't leave your mouth minty in the least bit. I don't know where all these high reviews are coming from. They taste like cheap mints in my opinion. I've had better.",1
B000ETAJZI,"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.",2
B000E1HVF2,My husband LOVES pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner. This is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat.

I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem.<br />After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that!<br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase.",5

I packed this because we were going to a local festival and was worried there wouldn't be much there she would be able to eat.  She appeared to be chewing the spaghetti and seemed just fine.  All of a sudden she began choking and I had to clear her throat.  The spaghetti had ""gummed up"" and formed a ball in the back of her throat.  The experience was absolutely horrible.  Please keep a close eye on your little one if you choose to feed this and be sure to feed extra slow!",1

(In Texas I was called a ""baby-mouth"" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips.

""Natural"" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein.",1

B000W5N16S,"Out of all the commercial grade dog foods, this one is a higher quality, but do not let that fool you. First, the ingredients are listed by weight, not by content so there is not as much chicken in the product as you might think. To make matters worse, there is only chicken and chicken meal in this product for protein. Soy meal is only a filler for dogs so they get no nutritional value out of it. If there were more meats and less fillers I would be more pleased with this product. I have a beagle puppy who chows this product down, however, this really means nothing. Just because your dog eats it doesn't make it good for them. Make sure the first few ingredients are meat, and the product has little to no grain (rice, oats, barley are GOOD; corn, wheat, soy, etc are NOT).",2

B004VLR4XA,"I did a wheat-free trial diet for 30 days, and one of the snacks I had on hand were these lentil crackers from the Mediterranean Baked brand.  Plain Sea Salt Lentil Crackers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Crispy crackers don't leave you feeling heavy after snacking.<br />- Different dips or toppings can be paired with it.<br />- Great list of ingredients<br />- Gluten-free<br />- 5g protein in a serving.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Rather bland and tasteless.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I found the crackers to be pretty bland.  They're not overly salty, which is nice, but I guess lentils just don't carry enough flavor on their own.  These crackers are good if you have a dip or topping for them, as their bland flavor makes a great base for just about any dip flavor.<br /><br />These are an okay snack for those on a gluten-free diet.  If you don't need to live gluten-free, find another cracker, for your tastebuds' sake.",2

They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now.

To my mind, however, nothing that costs over two dollars -- I paid $5 for a little bottle -- should contain both corn syrup *and* trans fats.  (Why does a spice need fat?)

I even resorted to trying to wrap it in bits of ham the way that we administer pills to her. She is very picky and sometimes once you can get her to at least taste something she comes around and decide she likes it.<br /><br />In this case, it didn't work out. She ate the ham and spat out the dog food. After repeating this on several different occasions I took the hint and quit trying to get her to eat the food.

B000FDKUSO,"I am so happy that Amazon got these back in so I could order my second case. I don't eat wheat, it packs the pounds on me around my middle. Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.<br /><br />I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.<br /><br />Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.<br /><br />Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!<br /><br />Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them.",5
B006Q7YFLQ,"When I saw Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats in the Chicken flavor, I thought it would be a nice treat for my four indoor cats. I opened it up the very night the package arrived and gave one to each cat. They were interested in these treats at first, licking at them, sniffing them, and one cat even nibbled a little of it. That was the extent of their interest, however. All four treats were still laying on the floor 24 hours later. I've never seen these cats turn their nose up at a treat and they have never left one alone that long.<br /><br />I set cat food on the porch for some of the neighborhood strays, and along with those kitties I see raccoons, skunks, and possums visit my porch every night. I took the four treats my cats turned down and put them on the porch. The next day I found that not even the scavengers liked these treats.<br /><br />The package says these treats are for cats or dogs, so I took the rest of the package to work, where my boss brings his dog every day. CD (the dog) wasn't so sure about the first one, but took it anyway and ate it after looking at it for a bit. After that first one, she ate another right away when she got it and seems to enjoy them without hesitation now.<br /><br />I would say that these are probably not a good buy for your cats, based on my kitties' reactions, but your dog might give it a shot.",3

I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened.

Like I said just a little bit of pressure & the drawer slides out no problem. Believe me if it had issues I would never hear the end of it from my wife.

The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.

A suggestion: Just charge the 30 cent difference ...or, even an extra 89 cents is fair if the ingredients cost more ... but the full price is an 'insult' to the customer.<br />The sales clerk apologized & said that ""It didn't make sense to her, either!""",3
B0062A87HA,I usually buy this at our local Whole Foods or Harris Teeter it's a great product but when I ordered it from Amazon all but 2 out of 12 cans arrived dented. Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans.,3
B002C4HZ00,"Received Different than pictured. Labels Just say ""certified"" not ""D.O.P. CERTIFIED"". Don't know if that is the same and after a couple of orders I am not going to put the effort in to find out.<br />Also came with Basil. I want tomatoes only. Not Basil.<br />A couple cans dented like others have said.<br />My case was $44 now its $60.<br />I'm over the tomato thing. I'll buy what I want in the store.",3

B000E65OF6,"Tea has a great flavor - almost what I'd call 'spearmint' flavor which is great with honey or sugar with or without cream. I drink it hot and if it does cool, it's still good.  It does help me relax and go to sleep when I've had a long day.  My grandchildren love the flavor and we often share a pot of tea as it is perfectly safe for them.  Celestial Seasoning Teas are great teas always but Sleepytime is one of their classics! I'd recommend this tea to anyone, as out of all of Celestial Seasonings teas, this is probably ranks as close to number one on my list of favorites.  And I do have a lot of their tea in my pantry -- my son swears I must own stock in it, LOL.  If you like tea, try it, I really think you'll be glad you did as I feel Sleepytime truly is one of their best teas. :)",5

B004A6F0Z0,"This is a pretty nice starter kit for the price.  My only complaint would be the light damage done to my tree by the display box that it was obviously in for too long.  But just a few months later, and my bonsai is doing just great now!  There is new green growth on the old damaged branches, which is nice.  Still, overall a good deal for the price.  Would make a great gift!<br /><br />Ok, it's been 5 months now, and the tree is doing absolutely great!!  I woudn't worry AT ALL about how I said it came in the box... very strong and dependable tree regardless.  I'm VERY pleased with this tree, and it's now been moved to a bigger pot as it's doing so well!!  By far my FAVORITE of my 8 different bonsai trees ordered online!!<br /><br />Almost a year now, and still growing strong!  I've had three other bonsai plants die from different companies, but this one continues to thrive!  I'm now using the small pot it originally came in for another bonsai.. yes the pot it comes with is small, but it's very durable and great for starting small bonsai or other plants.  I'd still strongly recommend this starter kit to anyone interested in starting the art of bonsai.. and even for experienced growers.  It's such a wonderful kit.  The tree is healthy, the pot is durable, and the soil works great!",5
B000NMGB4E,I thought that I purchased the larger size box which would have been a good price but by purchasing the tiny box the cost was more than other places.  I am using them in Welcome Bags for a wedding in the Boston area so they still will be a fun item for the bag.,3

I can't say its a problem with the product, which arrived quickly, well-packaged and in good condition.  But the plain one she has chewed on for weeks, whereas she showed no interest in these.  Fortunately it wasn't terribly expensive, as I think the remaining hooves are going to the neighbor's dog.",3

I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer.

The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.<br /><br />The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege.

B001RVFDOO,"These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.",3

B0007ZLRUU,"I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic.  Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid ""bite.""  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one.",3
B001LG945O,"...and you'll have a pretty good idea what this tastes like. The tangerine (and/or the added flavoring) provides a nice 'tang' to the flavor. I found it to be quite tasty and refreshing.  I'm not sure why they are packaging it in the small 8.3 oz ""energy drink""-size cans, unless it's to keep the calories per serving down. At 140 cal.can, it certainly isn't low-cal, but there is no added HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) or sugar. The surprisingly high price is also a downside. True, real juice is a lot more expensive than water and HFCS, but at this price, I'll give it a pass.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good taste, not too carbonated<br /><br />Cons:<br />Small can, expensive, fairly high calorie/oz",4
B001LGGH40,So how does it taste? Well depends on how sweet you like your drinks. It is tasty but it's not as the container would leave you to believe that it is good for you. This is no better then drinking a soda filled with corn syrup because of the amount of calories and carbs it contains. It's all sugar and it shows not only going in but around the mid section if you pounded these things for a few months straight.<br /><br />Pass.,2

B001M0ALFG,"First, 2 of the cans in the order were dented.  Amazon was very good about shipping out a replacement, and one of those cans were dented as well. There was absolutely no damage on the amazon boxes, I can only assume that the damage was pre-shipment.  However, with Amazon's great customer service, it just takes a little more effort to get a complete order of undamaged cans.<br />Second, there is added sugar in the ingredients. If I had known this before ordering, I would not have ordered this brand.<br />Third, they are absolutely delicious.  They beat out the taste of canned flame roasted red peppers hands down.  These peppers are small and packed full in the cans.  This can contains more peppers than a 24 oz can of normal red peppers (flavor wise, this can may have more flavor than a #10 restaurant can of normal flame roasted red peppers)<br />Ordering through Amazon, this is less than half the price of buying in the specialty shops, not even including the cost of gas.

B004CLCEDE,Okay so my noodles came today and I was really excited to try them. I read good reviews and bad reviews..but I still wanted to try on my own. I opened the bag and just like the reviews it did have a fish smell...the smell wasn't as bad as I would've imagined..it's tolerable not as bad as a smell of after taking a dump. I washed them with cold water for about a minute..the smell was there a bit. Boiled them in hot water for around 5 minutes and the smell was kinda gone. So I put them in my already cooked meat sauce. Let it cook up for around 5 minutes. I tried just one little noodle...goodness..let's just say I didn't want to try again. The taste well it DOESN'T taste bad. The TEXTURE!!!!!! that's where the problem is....it just felt like I was eating a raw worm!..no I've never eaten a worm..but you know how soft warms are and imagine eating it and you feel that soft crunchiness...that's what I felt while eating it. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat the whole pack. Some reviewers said it was like rubber band....well...at least rubber band has a more harder texture. A worm is the closest thing of a texture I can tell you.<br />Do I recommend this: Of course not haha good luck. I bought mine at iherb (2 packs) for &lt;$4 so I feel sorry for those who bought 6 packs and had to throw them away.,2
B005K4Q37A,"I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more ""real"" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)",2

B000CRHQN0,These are the best protein bars that I've ever eaten.  It's a huge plus that no sugar is added and they are gluten free.  LOVE THEM.  I've purchased them twice from Amazon and was very disappointed (both times) in the condition of the product.  The chocolate looked dull and old like they had been in Grandma's freezer for too long.  Further the taste and texture were also a bit off.  My 4 and 5 year old boys love these.  They will split one before a soccer game or a mid afternoon snack. My advice is to buy them elsewhere and you will be pleased.,3
B007RTR8AC,"A couple of months ago I started using the Clear brand shampoos. I began with the ""Strong Lengths"" shampoo and conditioner, and my primary complaint was that it seemed to rob what little volume my hair had. So, I was excited to try the ""Volumizing Root Boost.""<br /><br />I will say that I did see an increase in volume. But, my hair is very fine and I just got it cut pretty short. So, if I didn't see an increase in volume to some extent with this shampoo, I'd call it a flop. The problem I have is that my hair is now more fly-away and less sleek and shiny than it was with ""Strong Lengths.""<br /><br />Here are my primary observations:<br />1. My hair has appeared much healthier (and I have received comments from others to that effect) since I switched to Clear shampoos. That includes both product sets that I have tried.<br />2. I would love to have tried the volume boost shampoo and conditioner set before I got my hair cut, but with short hair I'm not sure this would be my first choice. As much as I hate to use other products for volume, I think that might be the better solution for me.<br />3. I have not tried using this shampoo with one of the other conditioner options, although I did try the volume boost conditioner with the strengthening shampoo. I don't know that I saw much of a difference mixing those two.<br /><br />So, bottom line - I still really like the Clear brand, and I don't dislike this particular product from the brand. I'm happy to have it and use it, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way, with my hair cut and type, to purchase this product over other Clear products.",3
B000EMQFZI,"I was disappointed to learn that General Mills sold this product to Diamond Foods (the nut company) in early 2009.  Since then, Pop Secret Homestyle has become unrecognizable.  The kernels are larger than they used to be and they have so many husks that it chokes you to swallow it.  Not to mention the fact that you need to keep toothpicks and dental floss nearby! Oh, and make sure you have something to drink handy while eating it because of the choking issue. It it really unpleasant!  They also did something to the flavor.  I suspect that they no longer use real butter because now it has no flavor at all.  It is just salty and greasy.<br /><br />I used to have trouble keeping Pop Secret in my house because it would be devoured as soon as I bought it.  Now I have had 4 boxes sitting in my pantry for months that nobody will touch.  I don't believe I have ever before experienced such a drastic and disappointing change in a product that I used to love so much.  Guess I'll have to switch to Orville now.",1

B001ASZV78,"After trying the Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whiskey Cake, I found it dull and a disappointment to a palate that has been gifted with some of Britons finest Cakes. It is not moist as it should be. It has only a slight hint of Whiskey certainly not obtained from the top shelf. It became pasty as I permitted it to blend in my mouth. The pecans are ground so fine they are lost in the breading and produce only a hint of flavour. If one was to remove the Irish Whiskey from this product you would have a basic run of the mill raisin nut cake that is best eaten with a tall glass of milk to assist in washing it down. In my years I have had numerous authentic Irish Whiskey Cakes including living 3 years in the midlands of England. Tasting a good Irish whiskey cake will initially produce a moist nutty texture on the tongue followed by a moderate but not over powering bath of Irish Whiskey to the palate. It blends with the saliva and becomes similar to a bread pudding texture almost immediately complimented by the raisins. As one swallows, the aroma of the Whiskey remains in the mouth and can be sensed in the nose. It should be moderately sweet, the Whiskey delicate, and the nuts and raisins a compliment to the texture. Even at the low price I would not purchase this product again as it insults the refined integrity of a traditional Irish Whiskey Cake. Most Irish Whiskey cakes will cost you in the neighborhood of $15-20 per pound. I would regard this product to a good Irish Whiskey cake the same as Meatloaf to a Prime Rib.",1

B000ETAJZI,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.,1
B002ZJ3C18,"I agree with earlier review. Generally I would say, ""buyer beware!"" and ""read the label, and set a better table.""<br />What it says on the front is ""Dry Roasted Peanuts."" the other kind is ""salted."" It wasn't until I got them home and popped the top that I noted they were flavored and saw the MSG listed in the ingredients. I would not have bought them otherwise.<br /><br />I didn't mind most of the other flavorings, but the MSG is just not a necessary ingredient  Furthermore, there is NO contact information for the company on the label. It was only looking them up on the web that I discovered they are part of the Diamond Nut Company. Will not purchase again.",1
B002LO5SFA,Very happy I made this purchase.  It is exactly what you think it is and is a good value.  Arrived very quickly.  Spike is honestly the best.,5
B001EQ5IPQ,"I've tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water, though slightly more dilute.  The ""wholesale"" price here doesn't make much sense to me.  It's about $5.75 per liter in an 12 pack.  I get it for $4.99 at Publix.  The only disadvantage is that they only have maybe 4 or 5 at a time, but I'm one of few buying it and I sweep the shelves of it (LOL).<br />  I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated.  I don't experience any leg cramps like I did during my first pregnancy.  I think the potassium makes a huge difference.  And with a tendency towards gestational diabetes, the low sugar content vs. other sports drinks is a huge advantage.  They should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes (with no renal issues).",4
B001FCLLM8,"I'd had a bulk bag of St. Claire's Ginger Snaps and really liked them. When I finally ran out, I looked for them again, found these Ginger Sweets and though they were the same thing.  They are not quite the same - they're a lot larger, much softer and very prone to disintegrate into a lot of white dust.  My shipper did a valiant job of packing them, and even so, the dust was EVERYWHERE in the package.  Fortunately it stayed IN the package or I might have had the FBI on my doorstep.  They really aren't suitable for mailing long distances.  I sure wish that St. Claire's would bring back the smaller, harder Ginger Snaps, but oh well.  I won't order this kind again.",2
B006K2ZZ7K,"I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",4

The Bigelow is also much less expensive (175 bags for about $7.00).  I've had better tea than all of these in Asia, but don't know the brand names.<br /><br />Also, if you go to China or Japan, green tea is usually not green.  It varies from dark brown to pale green, including many shades of amber depending on growing conditions, processing and harvesting time.<br />[...]",4
B000KFXEYE,"I love this stuff!  This is my favorite of the flavors I have tried.  I do feel like I have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that I like, but that is okay.  I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all.",5
B000GAUKP4,"I didn't purchase this fruit from Amazon, I got it from my own grocery store.<br /><br />The bag I bought was very heavy on the plums but they were good. I didn't like the apricots at all, they were huge and had some sort of grit on them that crunched my teeth when I bit in.<br /><br />A positive though is that everything was nice and soft - even though it's called dried fruit for a reason that doesn't mean I want petrified. Also all the pieces of fruit were larger than what I usually get, at least two bites per piece.",4
B0016FRI8A,"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.",4
B002TMV3E4,"I remember the cool, modern Melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago. A visual delight of glass and wood (without a hint of plastic), they were elegantly ahead of their time. I wish I could say the same for their coffee. It's fine coffee. Good, actually. However, nothing really special. I would buy it again if priced right, but probably would not go out of my way to get it, and certainly not at a gourmet price point. I must be honest and say that with the Melitta name, I expected a little bit more. Maybe I just got a an ""off"" batch. Let's hope so.",4
B004776JPW,"I purchased this tea along with several other kcup varieties for a coffee maker that gets occasional use.  Unfortunatley, the expiration date on the Celestial Green Decaf Tea purchased here on Amazon is within one month.  I know I will be throwing away most of this tea because it will expire before it is used.  All the other kcups purchased have at least one year before they expire.<br /><br />The shipping to return the tea would have cost half the price of the tea.  I don't think I will purchase any more food items on Amazon.",2
B005K4Q1VI,This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.<br /><br />Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.,3
B007I7Z3Z0,"Blackberry Pomegranate has never let me down before when it comes to flavored drinks.  When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.  From a packaging stand point, I love the way these little packets can be thrown in a glove compartment, purse, diaper bag or book bag.  They travel well and open easily.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet I would pour the powder into a standard water bottle (16.9 fl oz.) and shake very very vigorously.  I found that if the water was not ice cold and I did not continue to shake vigorously for a minute then there would be flavor crystal sediment on the bottom.  If the water was ice cold, the powder would incorporate well.  The color does stain, so that may be a concern for some.  Now for the flavor aspect...  Personally this Iced Green Tea mix is just too sweet and artificial flavored.  From the first sip I was assaulted by a cloyingly sweet and rather sickening flavor.  I resorted to sort of holding my breath and guzzling down.  When it came to the last quarter of the bottle I would always dump it; just too sweet.  For me, it tasted very much like what I remember red Kool-Aid tasting like when I was young.  I personally don't allow my children to drink red Kool-Aid.  They loved this stuff!  A bit too enthusiastically for my liking.  They would fight over the bottle, which was just plain odd.  Two days passed and when I returned to the cabinet I had discovered that the kids has been sneaking the packets and polished off the whole box.  My husband on the other hand, hated it and he loves sweet drinks.  He didn't like the sweet 'fake' aftertaste (his words).<br /><br />If you like very very sweet tasting drinks and prefer when drinks have that fake 'aspartame' taste then this should be a winner for you.  Our kids aged 9, 8 and 5.5 loved it.  They found it easy enough to mix on their own apparently.  I just wish that the product was a bit more natural and less 'diet'.<br /><br />Recommend only if you fit the the profile of a customer that would enjoy it.  If you love Kool-Aid mixed with way too many portions then you might just enjoy this.  Kudos on the packaging, which is very much like Crystal Light... thumbs down on a very kiddie oriented flavor profile.  Blackberry pomegranate sounds very adult... Kool-Aid not so much.",3

B00472I5A4,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.

B001KUUNP6,"We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.",5

B00866AM2G,"I purchased a couple of cases of Vita Coco coconut water on a whim, having heard great things about it from others and having read positive reviews for it online.  First off, for anyone unfamiliar with the product, or coconut water in general.  Coconut water does NOT taste anything like what you'd think.  I mean, come on, coconut water.  Sounds delicious right?  I hear coconut water, see the picture on the box, and imagine myself sitting on a beach banging open a coconut with a rock and drinking the sweet sweet juices inside.  Coconut water, unfortunately, does not match these expectations.<br /><br />When I first tried it, I couldn't quite place the taste.  It wasn't until a student of mine tried it and cringed, made a face, and commented that it tasted like glue that I recognized the flavor..no, I've never tasted glue, but if you taste the Vita Coco you'll understand what I mean.  There's a slightly unpleasant aftertaste as well.  I've never tried any other brand of coconut water, so I don't know if this is specific to this brand, or just what one should expect with all coconut waters.<br /><br />With all that said, the product actually isn't that bad when frozen to a slush.  I froze a half dozen of these and took them to the ball field with me, and after a half hour of baseball, these did a fantastic job of quenching everyone's thirst, with minimal wrinkling of noses.<br /><br />So to sum up, the product, if you are purchasing it primarily for the high potassium content and as an all natural sports drink, does its job admirably.  It rehydrates you and definitely helps in preventing any muscle cramps.  However, if you're thinking about purchasing this merely because it sounds as if it'd taste good, I'd suggest you think twice, or try a single box first to make sure you actually enjoy the taste(I believe they are sold at many supermarkets, I know I've seen them at Whole Foods before).",3

B0006M13WG,"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.",2

B000J2DQJQ,"After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to getting these.  The arrived and I excitedly opened a can.  The texture was soft and the fish fell apart at the slightest touch. I could barely pick it up with a fork as it broke into a million little mushy pieces every time I touched it.  I thought it must be a fluke- an odd can that was abnormal.  Every can I have opened is the same.  The flavor is fine but the texture is totally off-putting.  I'll not buy any more.<br /><br />B. G.

B003ZXCFQ6,"Kellogg's Corn Flakes cereal contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that Corn Flakes contain GMOs. Corn Flakes are NO LONGER G-R-RRREAT. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled. Kellogg does not use GMOs in these countries. We are boycotting all Kellogg's products.

B001EQ55RW,"Being an almond farmer myself, I am always interested to see what new flavors come out. Emerald is a subsidiary of Diamond Walnuts. The description indicates that this flavor is a substitute for the  chocolate covered nuts you may have already had.<br /><br />These merely have cocoa baked onto them. It does give the nut a nice earthy flavor. They have been roasted to the proper crunchiness. But these are not very sweet. If you are looking for them to be a dessert type snack you will be disappointed. The flavor is slightly more savory. The cocoa does not come off in your hand as much as you might expect... a good thing. These would be a nice classy addition to a party/gathering.",4
B002NGQSK0,"My mother loved them. However I wasn't too fond of them. What they are is a sugar wafer type cookie enrobed in chocolate. It's quite large but airy and crispy. The flavor lacked a bit for me, but as I said my mother enjoyed them. She wants more yet they don't seem to be available.",3

The 8.8 oz package says it is two servings but is really only one serving -- and has TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF FAT, 10 of them Saturated Fat, and 580 calories.

B001AWFBDI,I bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation. Compared to regular prune juice which has about 1.5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume. The ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each. Clearly it's more apple than prune. If your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere.  What a waste.,1

You get a short burst of minty flavor and then at least an hour's worth of a synthetic/chemical aftertaste which is quite unpleasant. I'll not buy them again unless Wrigley's returns to the original recipe. I guess they are saving a few cents by changing the recipe, but they are going to lose a whole lot of customers in my opinion.<br />  I would have rated the old Wintergreen Altoids with all the stars in the firmament, but the new ones rate none at all.

In addition, the plant STILL arrived in good condition. Its growing very well.<br /><br />A few things to note: This plant is, as stated, in a 3"" pot. Don't expect a giant man-eating plant. My plant came with about seven heads and a flower stem, which will hopefully bloom soon. The one thing that this plant does not come with his any sort of terrarium or other habitat for it, though the plant's robustness makes up for it. Make sure to follow the special care instructions with it and the plant will grow fine. It is definitely worth the cost and it makes  a perfect pet plant.",4

B0027Z8V4S,"We love French roast coffee and my husband must drink decaffeinated coffee.  His doctor recommends against all the standard variety decaf coffees as the caffeine is removed by a chemical process which the doctor does not like for long term health reasons.<br /><br />We discovered this ""Swiss process"" coffee in Canada last summer, bought it and loved it.  The taste is excellent for all those who love French roast coffee and one cannot guess it is decaffeinated.  We searched the internet for Swiss process decaf coffees and were delighted to find the Kicking Horse decaf on the Amazon site.  All our friends who have had it have enjoyed it as well.<br /><br />We have signed up for the procedure of having it shipped to us automatically once a month, and even save money doing so.  The price is right for this excellent product.<br /><br />We highly recommend it to all!",5

The coffee had a strong grip, but not bitter, and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used (note this coffee works well with a soy creamer).  You do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a 'decaf' option!  With such a strong grip, I would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is!",4

The main thing I noticed is that I have to scrub the hell out of my mouth and tongue after drinking it, because the flavor really, really stays around. I never noticed having to do this with Tully's. It's a gross, smoky taste. It's like having smoker's breath without smoking.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish this box...",1
B0010EI0QG,"I bought this because I'm grasping at straws. I was diagnosed with CLL (leukemia) in the latter half of 2010. Everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend. This was one of them. It, along with the other homeopathic remedies has done nothing to arrest the condition. My counts continue to rise (into abnormal range). Will it work for you? Some swear by this product as helpful. My suggestion: Buy three bottles. Take the recommended dosage ""religiously"" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply. Have monthly blood tests. If you notice an improvement, bravo. If you don't, then you are only out about $20. Is your life worth that? I hope so.<br /><br />Update October 20, 2011: I finished all the product I had purchased and reordered 3 more boxes. I still have not realized any improvement, in fact, my last blood test came back the highest (worst) it has ever been, by a considerable leap. Still it is the ONLY thing I am doing with any consistency and it gives my wife a sense that I am not giving up on myself. However, personally, my results cannot testify in favor of this product.",2
B001P05K8Q,"I have been buying these for quite some time now - they were recommended by our vet, and our dog simply loves them. They do a fine job of keeping her teeth clean, occupying her while we eat dinner, and best of all they don't seem to have any ill effects on her digestive tract (which is always a concern of mine with rawhide products). They seem well-made and thoughtfully produced. My sole gripe is, as others have mentioned, the uniformity of their size. Our puppy is only 50lbs, but I've found myself having to order the XL size package to ensure the bulk of the package is reasonably sized chews. I originally ordered the normal size package, but the ratio of S:M:L chews was definitely skewed in favor of S:M. Even with the XL size package, where the ratio is skewed M:L, we still get a number of very small chews - chews so small our dog can swallow them nearly whole after just a few minutes of chewing. This creates a serious choking hazard, and I sometimes find myself just throwing these tiny ones away. Obviously the size issue hasn't stopped me from buying the product (I'm very happy with it), but to earn a 5-star review some better size control would be required.",4
B0081XIAOQ,"I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the ""spin"" and ""flip"" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a ""cheater"", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a ""project in the works"", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!",2
B000G6RYNE,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.",1

B0045X7H9A,"I'm a college student, and therefore I thought this product would be right up my alley: energy drink, cheap, bulk purchase.

Five hour energy works, coffee works, monsters work, but Red Rain does nothing but put miles on the heart for no reason.<br /><br />I'd steer clear of this product.

B004X3VRLG,"Our trio of canine treat testers have mixed opinions about the palatability of this product.  Yesterday I gave one FunBite stick to each dog.  Gypsy, my female Shepherd cross, dropped hers on the floor and ignored it.  Jasmine, my female Collie cross, took hers back in her sleeping area in the indoor back porch, but come morning today, it was still untouched.  Sherlock, my male minature Schnauzer, absolutely LOVED his -- by morning he had gotten all the filling out and reduced the rawhide to a soggy chewy lump, which he has now eaten.  Of course, he's always been more of a chewer than his 2 pals, and he is also a smaller dog, so maybe it was easier for him to hold the treat between his paws?  At any rate, he will get the rest of the package eventually, but I'm not likely to buy any more.<br /><br />It's hard to say just why a dog does or does not like something.  Jasmine loves the raw eggs from my pet goose, while Gypsy will not touch them, but loves raw chicken eggs.  And all three dogs love matzah, which seems REALLY odd, since it is rather dry and tasteless.  Anyway, back to the FunBites, I guess you will just have to try them with your own dog(s) and see what happens.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After reading some of the other reviews here, I want to say that Sherlock doesn't seem to have any bad side affects from eating this, but then, he's always been something of a garbage can who eats anything (He's a rescue dog, knew serious hunger before we got him, so he is not picky about food -- ANY food.  If he had been a dog with a sensitive stomach, he never would have survived what he went through before we got him.  So he may not be a typical case here.)

The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.

B000I1OLT2,"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before.

Our pump is acting very funny, sometimes pumping out a full cup and other times just a half cup.  We have used ours hard for about 4 years i.e. 10 cups per day average.  I guess we will have to invest in another Keurig.  I have had Mr. Coffees for years without any problem, but love the ease of brewing one cup at a time and never wasting a whole pot.",4

B008O3G25W,"My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.<br /><br />One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.<br /><br />I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.<br /><br />My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.<br /><br />It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.",3

B00139TT72,"Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets.  After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.  Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.",4

Strong enough with an earthy, winey taste and smoothe finish (my description).  I eagerly tried their Daybreak, to my disappointment. Just ordinary. I don't often write reviews, but if this can get someone else to enjoy Mahogany it is well worth the time. If you have similar taste in coffee give it a try!! (and no, I don't work for them.)",5

B00141UC9I,"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?",1

We walked into the kitchen after buying it, saying, ""What is that smell?"" It smells distinctly fishy, like someone left out tuna or something.

Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over.",1
B00018CWZC,"Like the same vendor's Wasabi peas, these peas are use Yellow 5 and Blue 1 dyes to color them. That is a needless addition which no one needs. They also fry these with what they term 'vegetable oil' which according to their package adds about 1.5g of fat per 1 oz serving. Their Wasabi peas are said to use Palm Oil and add 3.1g of fat (almost 1g of saturated fat) per 1oz serving, so I wonder what 'vegetable oil' really means for these peas. Other products from this vendor have nutrition information that is completely wrong (like 0% for everything), so I wonder what really goes into these peas. They are salty and crunchy, but it would be nice if they did not have a bunch of dyes in them and there were clarity about what oil and how much really is in them. Fresh wokked English Peas will be a whole lot better for you, if not a convenient snack at the office...",3
B004YV80OE,"I consider this in the category of what should be quick, easy, edible food. However, the instructions are a bit more complicated than I like for food in this category. If I open this box, it is because I am short on time and need something quick and easy. However, here are the instructions:<br />1. Brown 1 pound of chicken (cut into 1 inch pieces) in a large skillet<br />2. Add 2 1/2 cps of water, seasoning and pasta. Bring to a boil<br />3. Cover and stir often for 7 minutes. Add broccoli; cover and cook until most of the water is gone, about 2 - 4 minutes. Remove from heat.<br />4. Add cheese with Velveeta cheese sauce pouch. Stir in cheese sauce<br /><br />Since some of those steps actually have multiple steps embedded inside them, this goes from and easy dump and heat meal to a more complicated recipe. For the same amount of work I can this same meal - just with fresh broccoli and ingredients I can actually pronounce.<br /><br />Now, I am no food snob - I actually enjoy the microwave version of the Velveeta broccoli and cheese pasta. Its just that the instructions for that meal is simply open the cup, dump in the broccoli dust, fill to line with water, microwave and stir in cheese sauce. For this amount of effort, the pretty much a similar product - I will pass in the future.<br /><br />Now, if you just really like the taste of Velveeta over other brands of ""cheese sauce"" and want a meal where all you have to do is add chicken - this is for you. However, this doesn't fit the bill for ""quick and easy"" and the flavor doesn't compare to fixing the same meal, in the same amount of time - with fresh or frozen broccoli and your own spices. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible; just not the ease I would be looking for in a box.",3
B001E5E29A,Let me start by saying my family loves this stuff.  It has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla.  It cooks up nicce and light.  My problem with this product is the recent price increase.  It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own.,4

However, if you are craving a snack: crunchy, salty, buttery satisfaction, minus the preservatives and unhealthy ingredients of normal snack foods, Grandpa Po's is the way to go!  It is the closest you'll get to guilt free snacking that wasn't found in the fruit/veg aisle in the supermarket.  4 simple ingredients make this crunchy popcorn soybean snack extremely satisfying and ""not-so-naughty"" when compared to the million other snack foods out there, not to mention the many unpronounceable ""mystery"" ingredients included in them - not the things you want to put in your body.  For my destination wedding, I brought a few cases of Nutra Nuts to put in my guests' welcome bags.  Well, no one even mentioned all the other local gourmet treats that were in the bags -the Grandpa Po's were the hit!  Everyone was walking around w/ their Grandpa Po's Originals pouch in hand: ""these things are GREAT!""  Clever packaging allows you to reseal and keep them fresh for the next urge to snack - although usually not necessary for this customer!",5
B003EML8PM,"The product itself is great, it's the bag that needs work.  I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty.",5

B002MG33XG,"We got hooked on Scottish Breakfast after a week in Speyside. Taylors of Harrogate brand is probably the closest to what you actually get in Scotland. This is not quite as malty and rich as that tea, and tends to brew up a slightly lighter color, but if you are buying in bulk, it's about half as expensive as Taylors. It can also be a bit sharp if over-steeped, but that can be said of just about any black tea - it just seems like Taylors is a bit more forgiving. So even though it gets three out of five for overall quality, it should get five of five for value - for $10/lb, if you can get free shipping, it's quite a good deal. Have this tea for an every day cup, and save the $20/lb Taylors for special occasions.",3
B004JRKEH4,"So my husband enjoyed this sauce and added it to things that he wanted a little kick to.  It is tasty but not spicy.  The sauce has a little kick and was something hubby would use when he just wanted to add a little flavor but not too much spice.  He actually liked it as a salad dressing to change up the usual rotation.  All in all the ingredients are not too bad but not what we typically eat.  If you want a creamy sause to add some flavor to a bland dish, this would certainly do the job.",3

I don't think you can ask for much more than that from a dog treat.  They are pretty hard and a pretty good size, so the dog seems to have a little trouble getting it broken down (she's a relatively small beagle).  Really small dogs might need these broken up a bit.  I don't think it's a problem that they take a while for the dog to consume, since that means she eats it a bit slower and it's longer before she comes back to me begging for some more.",4

B000EGX2EG,I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.,1

B0013NUGDE,"I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.",4

You start to sweat a tiny bit, but it doesn't burn your mouth.<br /><br />Would I buy this regularly? Probably not, it isn't healthy enough, but would I buy one or two of these to stick in my office cabinet in case I have to work late and haven't made alternate dinner plans?

I had it mixed with his old food for 2 weeks and have been feeding him only the Royal Canin for the last 2 weeks.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this food is his fur has gotten thicker and his skin isn't flaky. Aside from that, a cat who has NEVER had stomach problems has been experiencing diarrhea and vomiting in the last week. His poop smells WORSE and he hasn't had a solid poop in 2 weeks either. This food has truly been an awful experience and I will not be buying anymore.",1

B0042395CA,"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.",2

B001LGGH40,"I don't generally drink anything but water, coffee and tea, do not like soda, and only use juice in smoothies, so was surprised that I like the Switch juice drink as much as I do. I've only tried two flavors, the Kiwi Berry and the Black Cherry (Note: I did this review on that flavor also). They are pretty similar but I slightly prefer the Black Cherry. The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.<br /><br />The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor. There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days. Because it is juice only and a slight amount of carbonation, there is no after taste.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find these drinks to be too sweet at all, and I fully expected to considering all juice usually tastes pretty darn sweet to me. I think the carbonation may tone down the sweetness of the juice?<br /><br />For me this is a ""special"" once-in-awhile treat so I don't mind the price.  I like the 8.3oz amount; it is just the right amount -- forgot to mention in my other review on the Black Cherry flavor that this amount fits perfectly into a wine glass which really adds to the ambiance!",4

B001E5E0A6,"Caveat: I'm pregnant, and I bought these to head off nausea when I get hungry (which occurs about every 90 minutes). I don't have too many food aversions, just HAVE to eat, so I'm pretty sure that this is not just being pregnant, but it could be my taste is off. Having to eat so much, I really wanted to get something which wasn't QUITE so bad in terms of corn syrup, additives, etc., but I may have to go back to Nutri-grain bars, which I know I like the taste of. The filling on these was good, but the graham surroundings just tasted weird to me. The texture of the crust was also slightly off. I force myself to eat these on occasion as long as my stomach isn't heaving, but I wish I had bought a single box in the store to make sure I liked them before buying a lot off Amazon (though at the time, I didn't feel like going to the store at all). If you are at all picky, you might want to do the same.",3
B007I7Z3Z0,"The Lipton To Go Stix Strawberry Acai drink has a very pleasant flavor.  Unlike some flavor additives for water (cough...Mio...cough), these are not overly sweet.  The flavor is very well-balanced and refreshing.  Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't really taste like tea at all.  For some people, this might be desirable, but I would imagine that most people buying this product would be expecting the green tea flavor to come through more strongly.  In addition, the mix is slow to dissolve.  It didn't seem that any amount of stirring/shaking would completely eliminate the powder.  Over time, the powder dissolves more on its own, but this is definitely not ideal for an instant drink mix.  Overall, I'd say this is worth a try, but not quite living up to the quality I'd hoped for.",3
B0001IVR8A,"Just wanted to add my two cents in defense of the company. I too received a gift box that the glass was broken in, but one call to the company and about a 45 second phone conversation fixed my problem. They sent out a replacement  with no hassle whatsoever.",4
B0012AOIZK,"I confirm another review here that perfectly describes the texture and taste of this product as like chewing on a cellulose sponge! OMG! I love tofu, by the way. This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.<br /><br />I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think ""sponge"" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good.",1
B004CLCEDE,"I ordered these noodles, (6) Packages, because I wanted pasta and was doing the hcg diet.  There is a slight odor of fish when you open the package.  I dumped the water out and rinsed the noodles(no big deal really), boiled them and then and put them in the pasta sauce.  The noodles don't really have a taste themselves but there is a strange consistency when you chew them.  Sort of like jelly fish--chewy.  My husband could not get past the consistency of the noodles.  I didn't mind it as much.  Like I said there is no taste to them really and I will eat the rest of them myself.  The packages are small probably meant to be individual servings.",3
B002AR2IQ0,"I bought this product thinking I could use it to make chicken salad, not possible.  It was a can of jellied, mushy tiny pieces of chicken with only a few pieces large enough to use in chicken salad.

B001BSBFUO,My doggies give me a hard time when I have to give them a pill. These work especially when I give them fish oil for their coats. I split the pockets as they are too expensive to use on a daily basis.  They love the flavor. They do not like cheese - go figure??,3
B0081XIA1E,My dog enjoyed getting her treats from this toy.  I had watched some videos of dogs playing with the star before I purchased it and those dogs were pushing the star around with their paw.

B0018LHYCM,"I almost hesitate to give a review because this is my ""secret ingredient"" in so many things.<br /><br />My husband is from SLO and when we first met I thought it was so weird that the only thing he wanted from his mom for birthdays and holidays was Pepper Plant Sauce (I don't do spicy so I never tried it).  Then he got some of the seasoning.  Now I understand.  We use it in and on everything - eggs, steaks, popcorn (tip - put it in the butter!), chilli, black beans, soups, cooked vegies, tuna salad, guacamole, develed eggs (my fave).  Somehow almost every time I am ""making up"" some sort of savory recipe, this stuff makes it in there.  Just 2 weeks ago I had the idea to make dip with cream cheese, sour cream, the sauce and some seasoning.  It was a total hit at the play off party.  I just made it again today for our pre-superbowl potluck at work and got rave reviews again.  Heck - while typing this up I had the thought that the seasoning would make an awsome variation to garlic bread or crostini. Mmm - I might have to try that tonight.  You have to promise not to tell anyone though!",5

B00503DP0O,"This product has many claims, making it appear healthy. A quick look at the nutritional information, however, shows somewhat otherwise. Each bar is 180 calories, which is a good mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. Total fat, though, is 9g, with 2g saturated fat. Fortunately, it provides 2g of fiber and 2g of protein. Everybody's needs are different, but this product is just outside my range of what I consider a ""healthy snack"".<br /><br />Most of the ingredients are ""organic"", which is a plus. They are also sweetened with agave and coconut sugar. However, for my personal taste -- and I have quite a sweet-tooth -- this product is too sweet for me. Perhaps it's the chocolate, or one of the other sweetening ingredients, but by the time I finish the bar, I'm reaching for something to drink to cut the sweetness. The benefit of this is that the bar is a good candy-substitute if you are craving a sweet treat in the afternoon hours.<br /><br />The texture is good -- this bar is like a heavy oatmeal cookie. There's nothing hard or crunchy in it. It's very soft and chewy.<br /><br />If it weren't for what I characterize as an extreme sweetness, I could give this product a higher rating.",3

B004CYLW7A,"Three members of our household tried this cereal, and in general it met with favorable evaluations. Only one of us pours milk on cereal and he was impressed that even after 5 minutes it still remained crunchy - probably because of the sugar coating. The other tester has the philosophy that nothing is ever sweet enough and this met their criteria (yellow corn meal is the first ingredient  and sugar is the second). The third tester was a bit disappointed that there was not as much of a peanut flavor as they expected. The cereal pieces are not as textured with peanut slivers as they look on the box picture.<br /><br />We all came to the conclusion that we would buy it, except for the price that it is presently listed at  ($29.95 + $7.71 for 4 boxes). That seems a bit high for many budgets.",4
B004R8FKO2,"I bought Planter's creamy PB since I'm a big fan of their packaged roasted nuts.  I was hoping to find a tasty peanut butter from Planter's as well, but this product just tastes bad.  First, it looks really shiny in the package.  It does spread well, but it's so oily--and I'm not talking about the natural variety either--that it slides off the sides of the bread.  I suppose this might be related to the fact that hydrogenated vegetable oil is the third ingredient on the list.<br /><br />Second, this peanut butter leaves a bitter aftertaste.  It doesn't really taste right.  I had to take a drink of water after every single bite to get the piece of cinnamon raisin toast I experimented with down.  It wasn't the cinnamon raisin bread I used either because I have bought the same brand--Sunmaid--for years.<br /><br />I do believe I will be sticking with my usual brand of peanut butter from here out.  I've never had an issue with Jif, the brand I typically buy, tasting bad. It's too bad because the price was really good on the Planter's brand.",2
B002DVVP6W,"Let me start by saying I really like these snacks. I've not tried the salt or cocoa flavors, but the pepper and salt taste very good. Very nutty with just the right amount of black pepper bite. These snacks are derived mostly from wheat and sunflower seeds with some sesame seeds. In addition to the black pepper flavor there is a slight hint of jalapeno and even less of garlic. While these are a great alternative to peanuts, they are not a low fat or low caloric snack. Each piece, or cracker, is about 10 calories and a serving has 10% of your RDA of sodium. Indeed, they taste very salty and suspiciously are difficult to stop eating.<br /><br />If I like Somersaults so much, why just 3 stars? If you look at the ingredients it seems odd that a high sodium snack has salt as its last ingredient. In fact, modified food starch comes before salt. Where is the rest of the sodium coming from? Look closely at the ""seasonings."" In parentheses the seasonings used in the snack are listed in order of abundance. The very first ""seasoning"" is ""spices"" and the second seasoning is ""yeast extract."" Yeast extract is an analog for MSG (processed free glutamic acid). In short, the sodium is mostly coming from a form of MSG. Please be careful eating these if you are sensitive to MSG.<br /><br />So what do we have here? A tasty snack that contains too much sodium and has a flavor enhancer derived from a form of MSG. I still really really like these snacks and I will continue to buy them, but with so much sodium and the use of yeast extract I can't rate these any higher. Note that this company is not by any means alone is labeling something as ""all natural"" while using a form of MSG.",3
B006QQ2P3M,"Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep.",3
B001LXYA5Q,"A friend referred me to these and told me that they were ""freaking awesome."" I decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well.  I found that the taste of them, while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid, but nothing I couldn't tolerate.<br /><br />After it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it.  We cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did.  The lemons tasted like a 'lemon drop' candy, and the limes were very refreshing.  We then expanded our horizons and started trying other things to see what it was like. We found some other foods to be excellent, and others not so much.  All in all it's very fun.<br /><br />They are, however, quite expensive. The effects on me lasted roughly 1-1.5 hours.  So as a novelty, hurray for these.",5

I don't think it would have mattered as all I tasted was a cold cup of your standard cheap grocery store brand coffee.  Even my wife who drinks much more coffee than I disliked it.  It wasn't that it had a rich, strong capuccino taste which I actually like - the coffee tasted bitter, had a strange after taste, and would have needed ALOT of sweetener for it to be even marginally palatable.

Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.",2

Then you stir in the Velveeta cheese, and dinner's ready.<br /><br />I had a few problems with the meal.<br /><br />First problem, the recommended cooking time for the pasta, made for a too-soft consistency. Better to reduce your time by a few minutes, I think, for a more ""al dente"" consistency.<br /><br />Second problem, the saltiness!  Even with the addition of the very creamy Velveeta cheese, the flavor of salt was overwhelming. I don't know if I can recommend using less of the packet of ""seasoning"" since I don't know how that would affect consistency or flavor of the dish.<br /><br />Now, the box says this contains 850 mg of sodium.

On top of this there was no effort to redo, what is in my mind, a major wrong.",1

B007TGDXMU,I don't care for the San FRancisco coffee. It has a bitter aftertaste perhaps like the Cajun coffees with Chicory or something. I don't care to purchase anymore of it.,2
B001E5E2GS,"This product cannot be cooked more than 1 package at a time, and even then you will need to watch and stir it lot (be prepared for a workout).  The consistency is like rice not pasta. So the water becomes milky and if you don't cook it correctly (which is difficult if you really want it al dente), it can be very chewy.  The taste does not lend itself to authenticity.  I wish I had not bought it and am stuck with the other packages :(",2
B000G6MBUA,"Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.  But normal people, please do not try this at home.",2
B001E5E29A,"I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them.",4
B000F52NU0,"I've never been addicted to candy.  In fact, I don't usually like candy with the occasional exception of Halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet.  But these little guys, watch out.  It might SEEM like a 12 pack is a lot, but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue.  A 12 pack will seem like there's a shortage of caramels in the world. LOL.<br /><br />I tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and I just can't.  To me it's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like ""Ahhh, that's it.""<br /><br />I can only hope that the gubment doesn't put a tax on it like cigs because then I'd have to put myself into an institution.",5
B000ER5DFQ,"This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.",1
B004MO6NI8,"The text on this can of No Fear Super Energy Supplement is very blurred, like the red ink doesn't line up with the rest of the print on the can, so I didn't try too hard to read it before I started drinking it.  I was a little more than halfway through the can when I realized that there are two servings per can--does anyone save half a can for later?  If you can figure out a way to do that it's probably a good idea, since each serving will give you 33 grams of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup.  I could have eaten a candy bar and come out ahead.<br /><br />All that sugar, plus 87 mg of caffeine (per serving) did give my skull wings, right before the sugar crash that followed.<br /><br />The flavor is far too sweet for my tastes, with kind of a weird fruit flavor.  It felt like the inside of my mouth was coated with syrup, like I'd been drinking cough syrup.  Come to think of it, this would probably make a great flavor for kids' cough syrup.<br /><br />It wouldn't work as a kids' drink, though.  The label warns: ""Not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine.""  Those who are allergic should know that it also contains soy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sugar boost but couldn't possibly eat another bag of Skittles, this is for you.

B000G1X45G,"I first tasted yuban while visiting my brother 20 years ago. he offered me a cup of coffee one morning, and I really liked it. It had a taste that was way different than I was used to. I asked him what it was and he said yuban and to my suprise, it also was decaf. I have never liked decaf, but this was better than any coffee I had ever tasted. We were all in Yuma for the winter. when we got home, we started drinking yuban decaf. I have since switched back to regular yuban, but my wife still uses decaf. we were drinking maxwell house at the time. Found out later that yuban is part of maxwell house. Yuban costs about a penny a pot more that I am more than ready to pay for the better taste. maxwell house is great coffee, and my 2nd choice. we carry our own coffee and coffee makers with us when we travle. We live in S W missouri and can only find yuban regular here, so we order it from amazon, and have had good luck dealing with them. We have had several friends switch to yuban after tasting ours.",5
B001JTIFUI,"UPDATE: After receiving order . . .<br /><br />My first review was a shimmering adoration of Argo tea, and this tea in particular. Now that my order has arrived and I'm drinking a cup, I have to ask: what happened? I used to be addicted to this stuff when I lived in Chicago and could go into an Argo store and buy it off the shelf. I remember it . . . differently.<br /><br />So--either I have changed, which is possible, or the other reviewer is right. (And my apologies for assuming he or she was misjudging.) There is something off about this tea, and I don't know what. But it does taste artificial and out of balance. Maybe it needs Chicago Municipal water to make the right chemical combination essential for the flavor I miss. But wow; what a disappointment. Proves the adage, ""you can never go back.""",2

B001EQ55RW,"If you're a nut lover this may be just what you are looking for. After all, once you get beyond proper roasting, there isn't a whole lot you can say about nuts other than what you add to them. If you bury them in salt, or immerse them in chocolate, you are getting more flavor, but the trade off is unwanted cane sugar, and/or salt; so these make a pleasant bridge.<br />Extra added flavor with the thin coat of dark chocolate cocoa powder (that doesn't get on your fingers by the way), while only ingesting 25mg of sodium in a single 1/4 cup serving.<br />When I first started to eat them, I thought the dry unsweetened cocoa powder didn't add anything desirable to the flavor, but as I progressed to finishing about a 1/4 cups worth, I began to realize that this could very well become a strongly acquired taste.<br />If I had to be critical of the entire presentation, I would note that the plastic ""jar"" has a threaded top with 2 half circle single threads partially overlapping each other that results in a not so very snug closure. With very little effort you can snug them at closure and skip right past snug to loose again, so much so that if you dropped the container the lid may pop off, spilling the contents.<br />I am not commenting on the way they are sealed though, they did an outstanding job of that. You have to pop open the plastic seal over the top of the lid edge, just to remove the screw on top, and then once open, there is an internal air tight seal to keep the contents fresh, and they are. Overall highly recommended, especially if you are nuts about nuts.",4

I dont think I will be buying these again unless it turns out this one can was a fluke and the others are more full.

True, Keurig is made for convenience, but really how much more convenient is it to add water and a kcup than to rip open a pack of cocoa and heat water in the microwave.

Nevertheless I stumbled upon this granola and figured I give it a taste.<br /><br />I must say that this granola has a good taste.  It could be easily used as breakfast cereal, put into yogurt, used in baking or just eaten out of the bag.  However, I was really surprised at the serving size versus the calorie count.  A half of cup of this ""all natural"" granola is 220 calories.  That seems like a lot.  Then if one reads the ingredients, it is quite plausible why the calorie count is so high.<br /><br />Overall, this granola is good, but nothing to get excited about or shell out a great deal of money for.  Besides once you read what is in it and how ""unhealthy"" it is, you be wondering how you are getting back to nature.",3

B0088OIA66,"I bought this variety pack so my cats could try the chicken flavors without fish, but they hated it. However, they did like a couple of flavors...so I will order those (if I can remember which ones! argh)<br /><br />My BIG questions/concern: the fine print on the bottom of each can says ""feed one can for every 3 lbs of bodyweight daily""...<br /><br />One of our cats weights 16 lbs (Maine Coon) and the other, 12 lbs, so I will need to feed a total of 9 cans/day. (who can afford that?) This MUST be wrong info?<br /><br />What cat would eat that much food in one day?<br /><br />Makes me question the company. (they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't ""caught up"" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats ""need"" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau.

B007I7Z3Z0,"The box proclaims ""Sweetened with Honey"", and honey granules are listed as the first ingredient, so I thought, finally, something that is just lightly sweetened.  Uh, no, once I tasted it I double checked the fine print ingredients and saw that there is Sucralose in it.  While honey granules might be the largest ingredient by volume, by taste, it is overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener.  When a maker is so deceptive in the presentation of the product, it makes me wonder what else is misleading in it.<br /><br />I tried diluting it, in order to reduce the sweetness.  Well, the berry flavor receded into the background, but it was still too sweet.  Too bad.....<br /><br />It tastes like punch, and the convenience factor is great.  I love the way there are so many of these little single serve water flavors available now, but the artificially sweetened ones are way too sweet, as is this one.  For now I stick to True Lemon unsweetened, and the other unsweetened flavor products from that company.<br /><br />If you like drinks to taste sweet, with a sweetness that lingers in your mouth for many minutes after taking just a sip, you'll probably like this product.",2

Fortunately, my dog is such a hog that she wolfs up every last crumb. Obviously she loves the flavor but my dog isn't picky so I would be shocked if she didn't like these. I would buy these again although probably not very often due to the slightly high price which is  a little higher than what  I usually pay for treats.

But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.""<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, ""Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is"". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from ""soaking the flesh of the older coconut"". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, ""OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!"" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)",2
B001HTJ2BQ,"I did not have any problems receiving an inferior product. I applaud this company's use of BPA-free cans, but the use of guar gum seems unecessary. Whenever I open a can it has separated, so the guar gum doesn't seem to be doing what it is intended to do, so why not leave it out and sell an additive-free coconut milk? I would like one that is both BPA- and additive-free.",4

B000GDAWRC,"Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!",1
B000X2CWTM,"Just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that I did before.EXCELLENT! They are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful. Really fresh. I did the subscribe and save and am happy that I did. My husband and I really enjoy this brand. The boxes are larger than I realized, But I still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me. The boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box. I can't find one bad thing to say. No dissapointments at all.",5
B0032BOIG6,"I tried integrating this into my German Shepherd puppy's food.  He is currently on California Natural Lamb and Rice puppy formula, but I have a hard time finding it - so I thought I would switch to this Royal Canin.  He loved it.  But then he started getting diarrhea.  The diarrhea may have been from something he ate in the yard and not the Royal Canin.  Regardless, I donated the Royal Canin to a dog shelter.  This is after I read reviews on it, and discovered it has some bad reviews.  It has lots of fillers in it.  I prefer a more natural, healthier dog food (this is my opinion after what I've read).  There are good websites to compare pet foods and read professional reviews on them.",2

B002IEZJMA,"There is something very odd with the sweetener in this drink, I think. It tastes at first like strong black coffee, almost burnt, with some sugar and no cream added to it. Quickly, however, a really strange acidity overwhelms the rest of the taste. It's a little like that cheap liquid ""diet"" sweetener from the 1970s, which tasted like chemicals if you had it by itself.  It would probably be okay in this coffee if the coffee itself didn't taste burned, or if it balanced with more cream-type taste.  In fact, I finished the rest of the can I had by mixing it in with about 2 ounces of pre-made iced coffee in a carton, and that made a huge difference.<br /><br />I drink coffee daily and really enjoy other illy issimo products. This one just is not that good.",2
B003JHLY7O,If you are talking ounces you would be better off getting a 12 pack for 19.99 at petsmart. These are tiny. They are only as big as a pencil in diameter one way. They are flat and about half pencil size the other. I do not even know if they are truely pizzle sticks as the ingredients only say beef chews. I personally never saw a cow with a pizzle this small! Must be calf ones.<br />I have small dogs so I am sure they will love them. They did come on time and were boxed appropriately. But for $50.00 it is not worth the price! As a shopper for dog treats for over 30 years these are worth about $25-$30.00 if you compare to whats out in the regular pet stores. Won't purchase again.,2
B001HTJ49G,"I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.",1
B000ZILM3G,"I was skeptical because I've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this.  But I'm glad I jumped in and decided to purchase it.  First of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift-wrapped free which is cool.  Second, the glass works great which is most important.  Its double-walled so when I poured my boiling hot water in the glass I had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my bedroom and barely feeling any warmth.  The filter/strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea.  This is the first time I've used something like this and it works perfectly for me.<br /><br />The blooming tea comes in three small containers.  I'm new to tea so I can't tell what kind it is...most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good.  The first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out.  Anyway I hope this helps people that are on the fence like I was about buying glasses like this.  This package is legit and well worth the price.",5

B003LIQ9US,"As the title of my review suggests:  I thought this jerky was a little rubbery but had good flavor.  Overall, I would say it's okay.  Worth trying to see if you like it.  I thought the price was fair (I know beef jerky is generally very expensive).",3
B001LG945O,"I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)  I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.  I have not seen this in the market yet, but I would be willing to try other flavors and add Switch to the many beverages I enjoy.  Really, for a fruit drink, it is pretty darn good!",5
B0041NYV8E,"Wow, gingery! I really like ginger, so for ginger LOVERS, this is a great drink. In fact, it's so gingery, that one may want to add a little more than the 250 ml (a little more than a cup) of water. I'm fine, I like it strong. The only detraction is that it's sweet and I'm not much for sugary drinks, but maybe adding more water will solve that problem too. All in all, I really like it. BURN BABY BURN. :) It's very gingery.",4
B004T80BYE,"I absolutely love Nutiva's coconut oil and so I thought I would love their Coconut Manna as well. Unfortunately that is not the case.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the container to soften the product so that I could mix the oil back into the coconut. I ended up using an immersion blender to thoroughly mix it which worked very well.<br /><br />I find it almost inedible. The texture is gritty and very thick. It sticks to the inside of my mouth and leaves an unpleasant dry sensation. It doesn't ""melt"" in my mouth as described on the container. I don't enjoy the taste either. The pure taste of coconut oil is there, but with another taste mixed in that ruins it and leaves an aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. I'm planning on trying another brand of coconut butter and see if it's a problem with the Nutiva brand or just my own taste/texture preferences. It's not anywhere near the expiration date, it doesn't taste rancid and the container was properly sealed, so I assume that the product is fresh.<br /><br />Update: 2-13-2012 - I purchased some Artisana organic raw coconut butter and compared the two. I have to say that I like the Artisana brand better. It's smoother and the color is lighter. It's also packaged in a glass jar which I prefer. The taste is also somewhat better. I now know that I don't really like coconut butter, it's just not for me. I would recommend that if you buy coconut butter buy the Artisana brand.",2
B000I1RHMU,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...,3
B004DBS2TI,"I hate calling out an entire brand, but sadly, I must. I accidentally ordered this thinking it was a different, very similarly named brand, and didn't realize it I brewed a K-cup. It was so bitter, typical of this brand (this is my third attempt with this brand). And of course, I just had to accidentally buy the jumbo 24-count pack. Even with a 1/4 c of cream or a whole packet of hot cocoa, it still has a big bite to it. Anyway, it's just not for me. Good price, though, and arrived on time.",2

He didn't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all--I feared for the worse.

Apparently it rises during the baking or something.<br /><br />Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.<br /><br />We've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far; I'm sure that will be delicious as well.",5
B002GWH6IE,"I've been trying various teas since I had to give up coffee years ago (blood pressure problems).  This is the first one that I've questioned whether the dominant taste I perceive is a contaminant.  The taste is quite strong, and unlike any tea I've tasted (and I have tasted a variety of English breakfasts, Ceylons, and Assams, among others).  I've given it 3 tries (interspersed with pots of other tea), and established that the taste is not the water or the vessel.<br /><br />I concede the possibility that some people may value this taste, but I don't.  Now I'm going to compost it and move on.",1

The store in my area stopped selling this kind of brand, sucks! I have to purchased it on-line now.",5
B004ZIER34,"Puroast Low Acid French Roast<br /><br />This is a dark roast coffee, and it was difficult to find out if it was decaffeinated or caffeinated, but it appears to be caffeinated. The packaging is not reseal-able to maintain freshness. The grind is a very fine powder, but works great with my French press. The taste and smell of the coffee was on-par with local brands and the name brands. I didn't find it to be particularly better than the coffee I normally drink, and the low acid part wasn't a big seller for me. I always take my coffee black without any cream, milk, or sugar, and even with double the normal dosage I use, the coffee didn't give me that jolt I wanted. The good news is that the after taste isn't as strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, great if you like coffee but cannot handle the acid, but I didn't find it to be a better coffee than less expensive store brand coffee.",4

I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!",4
B000CQ25QO,"I ordered this to try to get away from additives in food.  That I was able to accomplish with this, however, this was not nearly as good as the box leads you to think.  If you want a chalky, salty taste, then this is your pasta.  The pasta alone was not so bad, I think it was the cheese sauce.  For one, it is very hard to get all of the clumps to disolve.  Second, DO NOT ADD SALT otherwise you will have a very salty meal.  I made this tonight because I love pasta, especially Alfredo.  It took longer than most foods to cook.  The first bite was horrible.  The second and third was not so bad, but by about the fifth bite, your body is going to shut it off completely.  It leaves a nasty after taste.  I only ate about six bites and have not felt well since.  My stomach feels like the pasta is swelling inside.  Like I said, I love Alfredo, but this is NOT the usual Alfredo I have.  This is a poor imitation.  Maybe if you didn't have to buy in bulk of 6, and could only purchase 2 boxes at a time, it would not be so terrible, but unfortunately, now I have to look at 4 more boxes of it sitting in my pantry that I know I will never eat again.  Good luck to whoever is brave enough to try this stuff.",2

B000KNCZ2I,"The best thing about this gum is the packaging.<br /><br />Where to begin on what is wrong with this gum? About 30 seconds after the start of chewing, the flavor is gone. The gum devolves to chewing flavorless cud. Each piece of gum quickly reduces to nothingness while chewing. I had to chew about three to four pieces just to have an approximate equivalent to a ""normal"" piece of gum. If there's any benefit to the all-natural ingredients, I don't know what they are.

It's a great alternative to buying the expensive pre-filled K-cups; not only were the pre-filled K-cups expensive, but they don't offer my favorite coffee blends.  I was using the reusable K-cup filters which are quite expensive to purchase, so I only had 2 & they leaked while brewing & were messy to empty and wash to re-use.  The DisposaKups work much better--just as well as the pre-filled K-cups, no leaks, no mess!  And I can re-use them again if I want by throwing out the filter, rinsing, & using a fresh filter (just have to line up the holes).  Great product! I highly recommend it.  I love my coffee machine again.",4
B000QF90PA,"I just cannot understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  I am truly baffled.  The added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  It ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />Why buy dried mango?  If you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  Canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  There are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  These enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  These ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  Since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />The best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  If you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  Keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  They last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  Prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. Your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />However the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  Thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar will come off in the liquid found in the meal.",2
B0002NVKWC,"When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled ""from Italy"". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another brand.",1

B001O2IX8E,"I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.",4
B001LGGH40,"Switch certainly lives up to its name - it is definitely a switch from your normal drinks. Packaged like an energy drink, the Kiwi Berry Switch almost has the texture of a soda, and almost tastes like a sweetened fruit juice. Its a little of both, and actually manages to pull it off.<br /><br />Some people might find the drink a bit too sweet, but I found that the excessive sweetness wasn't accompanied by a lingering aftertaste, or a sticky, sugary residue that just makes you thirstier. It actually is quite refreshing, which is remarkable for a drink which almost tastes like liquid candy.<br /><br />The kiwi part of this kiwi berry drink it almost nonexistent, but the berry flavor almost makes you forget this. The size of the can is the perfect portion size for a drink of this nature; you wouldn't want to drink too much of this in one sitting. But the serving size is perfect for a taste of something sweet and refreshing.",4

B003SC0Q4C,Bought this flavor and brand for the first time. I have powered Stevia that I have been using to add sweetness to certain things and was surprised and my liking Stevia. I love ginger and love strong flavors. This ginger drink made me cough because the fumes got in my nose and throat my first sip but I did not have ice to make it less strong. If you love strong ginger flavor like I do this is a good sign and if its natural then the flavor is fine. I liked it and will buy it again and want to try the other flavors.,4
B0041NYV8E,There is no question that Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from ginger. The smell and taste is strong. I would suggest you start off light and continue too add the mix until you reach the strength of flavor you desire. I could not imagine how strong a bite this drink would have if not cut with honey. I do agree that with the advertisement that this is a strong ginger drink with a unique taste. My first sip shocked my taste buds that I almost did not continue to drink any. I did continue too and as I started too adjust to the flavor. The drink was not bad and it still had the ginger bite I wanted but this is not a blend I would seek out. I would drink but never buy it. Though flavorful; I did not find the experience enjoyable. The crystals do instantly dissolve to make this spicy beverage. And with the taste...I hope it is good for you.,3

The sensation faded to a tingle and finally passed, but for me, this drink is too strong.  The taste was fine, just not the sensation.  A second sip was all to similar to the first and so I passed on the rest of the cup.",4

I find it to be misleading that they call it ""Original.""  Original had the gift inside.",3
B001EQ55RW,"This product looks so good but tastes so awful. How can you ruin cocoa? Emerald has. This is not the adult treat it appears to be, but something only the kiddies will love. Way too much fake vanilla and not enough 'get down' cocoa flavor. What a serious disappointment. Just awful.",1

B001ACNWY8,"I was expecting bread like the package says, NOT! Its like eating a sticky chewy pancake.  And on top of that its pretty much tastless.  Im not impressed at all.  The only reason I gave this 2 stars is its better than nothing.  But for the price I paid I expected something special.  I won't buy this again.  Also it says on the package to ad cheese if you desire.  Its like a whole cup of cheese, and cheese is expensive.  I haven't tried it without cheese but I will try the next batch plain.  Oh well still searching for a decent bread substiute.",2
B000N62EKK,"These treats are the BEST for training, whether its obedience or agility. They were recommended to me from my dog trainer after learning she used them while conducting obedience training with my pups. They can easily break down into smaller bite-size pieces which is great for constantly rewarding good behavior (without overindulging or making them chew) during training. They are also great treats to be used as a small snack for your dog. I highly recommend them!!! My dogs will listen to anything I say when I have these in my hand.",5
B001LXYA5Q,"The mberry tabs work by altering your taste receptors and make sour tasting foods more sweet. I'm a high school science teacher, and I used these both in my classes and for my science club. The students love trying out different sour food items to taste the results. I've used this brand several times, and it seems to be pretty consistent in it's effectiveness and quality. The best way I can describe the effect of these tabs is it makes a lemon taste like a lemon ""shake-up"" from a fair/carnival. It does not create a super ""candy-like"" sweetness (which I think would be really weird anyway), there is still a hint of sour behind the sweet taste. Also, they do not last anywhere near an hour, more like 15-20 min., so just be warned, and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth. In my experience, there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective, maybe between 5-15% in a group (1-3 people per 20). The tabs are somewhat expensive, but as a pretty unique experience, I definitely recommend trying it at least once!",4
B004OV6X6Q,"With a consistency like a Little Debbie Brownie and a taste like the no-Pudge brownies, these will not be for everyone. However, if you are on a restricted diet (no soy, no gluten, no dairy), these bars fit the bill. They are not overly sweet, although there are 25g of carbs in each bar. The main ingredient is dates, so that is what provides the majority of the texture. The bars soft and dense, sweetened with agave nectar with no other sugar added.  It does contain 5g of fiber and 7g of protein, but only has 10% iron and 4% calcium RDA.<br /><br />My biggest issue is the calorie impact: at 190 calories, I want something that has a little more flavor, especially if there is little added nutrition (these can't be used as meal replacement, just as an occasional snack). The wrapper says ""Your chocolate prayers have been answered."" I seriously doubt anyone eating this bar would agree with that statement.",3
B000W7PUL0,"Very disappointed in this stuffing mix. There was hardly any flavor.

Nothing like the ""Chicken Everyday"". Now THERE is the perfect seasoning!",2
B003QNJYXM,"During a scooter tour of the southwest (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizon), a group of us decided to try one of the 5 hour energy drinks (I think I had the Berry 1.93 ounce, regular strength).  I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again.",1

Worth the extra $$ to buy them at a local store so you know they are in good condition.",1
B004FELBH8,"When I opened my package the smell was enticing, sweet... and really familiar. It was like a slightly sweeter honey graham cracker.<br />But the taste didn't live up to the smells promise. It was bland. Not graham at all, which wasn't what I was expecting until I smelled them, and not the adult cookie taste I was expecting from the description. Big let down, not bad, but not knock my socks off great either.<br />The 'fruit thins' did have nice bits of fig/fruit in it, but they were too sticky. While nice in taste the fruit bits just didn't contrast well with the thin crispy cracker texture.<br />I will probably serve the rest of these with, say, tea. When there is an expectation for a not too sweet, crispy accompaniment. But, I won't get these again otherwise.",2
B004CYLW7A,"I am beginning to think all Honey & Nut cereals are the same. I did not find Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal to be any different in taste from the other leading brands. It has the same sweetness, crunchiness and texture as the others. I would suggest reading the nutrition facts to compare this cereal to your usual brand of honey & nut cereal to see if one is nutritionally better. According to the box, a serving is 3/4 of a cup of Crunchy Nut cereal and contains 140 calories with 1/2 cup of fat-free milk. Each serving holds 1g of fat, 125mg of sodium, 23g of carbs (10g from sugars), and 2g of protein.<br /><br />On a side note, I am finding Amazon to be in line with grocery store prices, especially if you sign up for automatic deliveries and purchase in bulk.

B007M83302,"I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to ""pop"" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a ""use by"" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.",4

B001EO7GYY,"From a coffee snob's perspective, this coffee is really good.  It's not great, but it's good, and I'm drinking it, which says a lot.  What I really love about it is I'm supporting fair trade, a cause I support.  So I get to drink coffee and help someone at the same time.<br /><br />It's not as good as the Green Mountain National Wildlife Blend K-Cups, which I have also reviewed.  But it's good and I'd buy it again.  Hope this helps those of you who don't believe a pod coffee can measure up.",4
B007R1PGVS,"I tried this product at a local store and went back for 2 boxes because it is non-caffeine and non-sugar.  As a diabetic and someone who suffers from reflux, this is great.  And the $1 or so each is so much better than the $3 for those 5 hour drinks.<br /><br />A bit of common sense caution however; do NOT drink one close to the end of a work day no matter how much you need a pick me up.  I did that once, just once (never again) and I had difficulty sleeping.<br /><br />Second, if you are going to dump it into a bottle of water, drink about a quarter of the water (or pour it out) before adding.  The thing fizzes and can get quite messy.<br /><br />Third, do not take if you've an upset stomach or feeling nauseous as it can make one gassy.<br /><br />Otherwise, as I said, money wise, health wise, this $1 a pop, no sugar, no caffeine is great!",4

B002TMV3E4,"Normally I would not purchase coffee online as I have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance.  I saw this and figured ""why not?""<br /><br />This coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where I had to use scissors to open it.  One thing I tend to avoid is pre-ground coffee.  I usually like to grind my own beans as I find the taste is better.<br /><br />The smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic.  Usually, there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something.  There wasn't anything distinct about this coffee.<br /><br />I used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but I suspect it would not matter as I was surprised that there really isn't a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which I drank black.<br /><br />The taste was kind of bland.  I did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help.<br /><br />Overall it's an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado.  However, it's not something I would add to my list of brands I purchase.",3

Attracted to the product by its bargain price, I'm reminded you often get what you buy.  While the coffee tastes OK, it's no better than most other brands I've purchased.  This is the ONLY brand I've purchased, though, that has a defect about 50% of the time.  Coffee goes into the cup and sprays into the cup holder which ruins the beverage.  With only about half of the cups working properly that effectively doubles the cost making it anything but a bargain.  I will not purchase again and, if asked, will recommend against purchases.",2

B002TMV34E,"My wife is Austrian and her favorite coffee is the Julius Meinl coffee. We like this coffee so much that we order it from Vienna (in our opinion it rates 5 stars). In order to test how good this coffee is, I substituted the Julius Meinl coffee with the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme. My wife drank her coffee and did not say anything. When I told her about the substitution she was quite surprised and she asks about how expensive the Melitta is. Ordering coffee from Vienna is very expensive.<br /><br />In my opinion, this coffee is slightly (very subtle difference) inferior to the Julius Meinl which is our gold standard. Given that the Melitta is much cheaper we will be buying this coffee in the future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!",4

B002TMV3E4,"Decaffeinated coffee is for most an oxymoron, for others an afterthought. It possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the ""gourmet"" coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives. Comedian Bob Irwin even compared the blend to ""kissing your sister."" The day's first cup comes with a sense of entitlement; subsequent cups transition through the day (work, afternoon, dessert), while wanting both coffee's jolt and cozy sociability. (Instant? Don't get me started!)<br />That's why this new Melitta Riviera Sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise. It carries a full, almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which, for many, defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle. (This isn't surprising since Melitta's ad copy references the breezy feel of European cafes, a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop.)<br />No less than Henry Ward Beecher once said. ""No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils.""  Riviera Sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesn't disappoint when poured.(Hold to the preparation instructions; yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic.) Its taste, not its caffeine jolt, is your wake-up call. Recommended as a tastier, if somwhat pricier, alternative to major brands.",3

They are the same thing. NOT! These chips taste like vegetable oil. I was hoping for a chip like the last that I had, crunchy tangy and sweet. But these are deep fried which are not healthy. I threw the bag away. If you are looking for a potato chip that tastes like an apple, these are it. If you are looking for a healthy snack, look elsewhere.",1

They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients.

B001LG940E,"If you like apple juice, you will probably like Switch Black Cherry soda since the predominant flavor is that of apples.  A look at the ingredients reflects that it contains four juices: apple, grape, acerola, and cherry.  Since ingredients must be listed in descending order, it makes sense that this drink tastes more like apple than cherry.  The inclusion of acerola juice is good from a health standpoint since it is very high in vitamin C (one can of this stuff contains 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C), but apart from that this isn't a particularly healthy drink since it derives all of its calories from sugars.  It's certainly better than a high fructose corn sweetener produced soda, but it's still calorie rich.  Anyone who's concerned about his/her weight would be better to eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juice or sugar/HFCS sweetened sodas.<br /><br />I'll confess that I'm not a huge soda drinker nor a big juice drinker, so that might be coloring my perception of this beverage.  Still, I found it disappointing that the flavor was basically that of weak apple juice and the carbonation was extremely mild.<br /><br />ADDITION ON 4/9/09:<br /><br />I just looked at some of the other reviews of this product and am perplexed.  How can some people find this beverage to have a strong cherry flavor when others like myself barely taste the cherry?  I can understand different people rating the level of sweetness differently, but the variance in the perception of the fruit flavor has me wondering whether the manufacturer has shipped this product out using more than one formula.",3
B004CLCEDE,"It definitely helps to try these out not expecting a perfect pasta replacement. These are way more like the noodles you find in instant cup soups. And yes they did have an odor when first opened, but nothing terrible, and it was gone after a few min. of washing them in cold water.<br /><br />Some have said they can't work as a substitute in spaghetti, and maybe that's true if you're expecting an exact replica for a flour based pasta spaghetti dish, but I did try it, and I was happy with the results. I followed the advice of rinsing them then patting them dry, I did 2 packages of them at once. While that was going on, I was boiling water. I am a stickler for calorie counting and portion control nowadays, so I pre-measure and freeze most of what I eat. I had a measured portion of low cal. spaghetti sauce in a ziplock bag I was heating up in the water, but put it in too soon, as the bag broke and I ended up with spaghetti sauced water. So I made use of the accident to flavor the noodles. I boiled some pearl onions in the spaghetti sauced water, then added the noodles. Let that all cook for about 7min then heated up a second pouch of spaghetti sauce. I strained the noodles, put them in a bowl with the onions and now heated sauce and added some diced tomatoes and a couple shots of hot sauce. I wanted the tomatoes to cook a bit so I further nuked the lot for a few min in the microwave. Then topped it with a slice of fat free american cheese. It was actually pretty good. The noodles were on the chewy side, but not in a bad way. And they do soak up whatever you flavor them with. So as long as that part is good, the whole dish should be good. I think with these noodles anything spicy will work best. Which is why I added the hot sauce, something I wouldn't do with reg. pasta. I'll probably try a hot asian dish next.<br />But it's really nice to know I can eat twice the amount of the low cal/carb pasta I have been using which was 175cal a serving, and actually cut the calories of the dish down to basically just the 40cal in the sauce and 25 cal in the cheese!!!",4

The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.<br /><br />The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.<br /><br />That being said the black cherry was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks.

B0014WYXQK,"Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a nice alternative to the normal breeds of soda such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Dr. Pepper.  It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.<br /><br />The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.<br /><br />In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.  Give it a shot if you are looking for a Coca-cola subsitute.",3

B000VHJPKI,Not recommended for those with taste buds.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it's 0 calorie - so it has every right to taste awful.<br /><br />Would never buy again. Please god don't ever let me buy again.,2
B0013CF7XY,I ordered this hoping it would be a stronger blend.  It is good but not very strong.  I have to use two pods every time and it is still not that strong tasting.,3

B0031U9VI8,"I always taste the baby food before offering it to my baby. I thought this one tasted gross and had a grainy texture. I was expecting the baby to spit it out, but he loved it. He doesn't like many veggies, so that is a plus. We'll be buying this one again.",4
B000SSXTAM,No obvious taste! So perfect for decorating cakes!!<br /><br />Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3-4 at your local craft store - $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com.,4

Hopefully I can figure out a recipe to copy these things because they do work well.",4
B000MXJR40,I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.,1

B001CWV4PA,"I used to love these crackers and bought them all the time.  Even my family members who do not have to follow a gluten free diet thought they tasted good.  Then the company started adding sunflower products to the ingredients.  I knew with the first bite that the crackers now had an unpleasant ""twang"" in the taste.  I gave some to the rest of my family not telling them about the awful taste. They ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past.  As soon as it hit their taste buds, they said, ""YUK!""<br /><br />When checking out the ingredients, to find out what had happened to these crackers, I found the sunflower addition.  Unfortunately, besides the bad taste, I am allergic to sunflower products, so will no longer purchase them.<br /><br />I wrote to the company asking that they return to the original recipe, but never received a reply.",1

I have also complained to Libbys to no avail -- they simply issue the typical corporate lie as if they're responding to a first time user.",3
B003SWCZG4,"Ghirardelli isn't the finest chocolate you can buy, but it's pretty good, and the Intense Dark Assortment is both inexpensive, and provides you a few possibilities.<br /><br />I've lately taken to unwrapping a 60%, 72% and 86% cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer, to serve as an after-dinner sampler with red wine or Scotch. That's been a pretty popular approach. A similar approach also works ""therapeutically""---if someone's having a bad day, sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isn't a bad path to feeling a little better.<br /><br />I do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag; that's the only downside. Of course, if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests, you'll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras. Darn.",4
B000SANU8Q,"I purchased this tea to make iced tea and found it to be extremely weak in comparison to similar teas from other brands.  My recipe calls for 12 teaspoons of tea.

B001EQ5L0I,"By the way, this is not a loose tea but compressed cubes which is easier to take with you if you travel. I started drinking this tea when I visited China last year. I read about how it aids digestion after meals, so I drink it late at night. I noticed a great side effect of reducing my cravings for in-between meal eating and junk food. In that way, it can be used as a weight loss aid. It also helps get rid of excess water weight. I try to drink a cup at least every night and sometimes in the morning if I ate heavy meat the night before. This is not the same quality as the loose tea I buy in China but it will do until I get back to stock up. The true loose tea is much better because you can control how much you want to drink. For the reviewers who said their items smelled like fish, I have not smelled bad pu-er tea. The Chinese say it can keep for years if you refrigerate it or keep it in a cool dark place. I gave this only 4 stars because I have tasted better but I may order this again if I cannot get back to China.",4

B000HX8AC0,"I usually use Only Natural Pet Easy Raw dehydrated food, however I wanted to try Honest Kitchen's brand just to see how it compared, it looked & smelled like a pile of mush grass.  My dogs avoided it like the plague even my little girl who eats anything that is not nailed down.  I was panicking thinking I just wasted a huge chunk of money on something my fur kids won't eat when the Mail<br />Man rang and my delayed shipment of Only Natural brand freeze-dried chicken & beef patties came.  I was soooo happy!!!! I ripped open a bag of chicken, took a sniff, OMG it smelled so good!!!  I quickly crumbled the patty into the pile of green mush and my dogs scarfed it down in 5 minutes.  This food is so great & convenient.  Since it is expensive, I'm going to use it as a flavor enhancer in combination with other raw foods.  The Honest Kitchen food is very nutritious and easy to rehydrate.  However, it needs to be enhanced or combined with other ingredients such as meats (beef,turkey,chicken,buffalo, etc). I also add fish oil for shiney coats and sometimes add a raw egg as well.",3

B001BSBFUO,"Hiding gelcaps inside the pill pockets work very well for me. I grabbed the large kind and cut each one in half, then squish them between my fingers a bit to get the pill pocket nice and soft before shaping it around my dog's medicine. He doesn't love these, but he prefers them to raw pills.<br /><br />The only con about this product for me is that a lot of the time, many of the pill 'pockets' arrive in the bags completely smashed together or torn up into bits and pieces. I guess it isn't a big problem since I cut them up anyway, but it would be nice to not have to pick out pieces of them from inside the bag to mold together.",3
B001LG945O,"If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but it's too much of a hybrid for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).<br /><br />The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to ""spend"" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  I've tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess I'm just not ready to make the Switch!",2

B007M83302,i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip,3

B0058AMY74,"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.",1

Noodle texture was off, but edable.  i.e. at no time eating it, did I think teriyaki noodles, and I like teriyaki.<br /><br />Ok, so high end it isn't.  It was alright overall, and if you don't think about it too much, its not bad.  The veggies were a bigger surprise, as a lot of small bits went in, but actually had large pieces of green leaf material after cooking.  If using as a starter to a bigger meal, I think I would just start with a ramen pack and build from there.  It seemed to need more water than it called for.",3

She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did.",1

B00444ZAQM,"Olives are yummy and a good diet snack, but I just can't quite give this 5 stars. Why?<br /><br />Because first of all, the flavor is occasionally too overly strong with some of the packs I've picked up. I love the taste of chili powder mixed with olives, but sometimes the flavor just isn't as consistent from pack to pack. I'm fine with some changes in taste, but some packs have it packed on while others have been fairly weak. This isn't enough to keep me away from this flavor, but it can be aggravating.<br /><br />The only other issue I have is that I wish that this was resealable. I don't often eat all of these in one sitting and I don't really like having to bring a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion I don't eat. It would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of adhesive fixed to the bag. I didn't deduct a star for this, but it's something I'd like to see.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a great product. The olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size.

Since I tend to use good products, this actually means it appears to be a decent shampoo.  It just didn't rock my world in any way.  For the price, it is a nice choice.  Certainly better than some of the drug store cheap shampoos that dry out your hair.",3
B004YV80OE,The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was not as good as the Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit.  I think the primary difference is the pasta used.  I prefer larger pasta and this particular kit had pasta the size of plump rice grains.  On the other hand the Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit has nice large yummy pasta that don't get all stuck together.  So I'll stick with that Kit and pass on this one.  You can always buy a nice mac and cheese regular kit from the store as well as Velveeta cheese and add what you want for a greater cost savings.,3

The mix of organic popcorn and organic soybeans makes a great alternative snack food and we love the re-sealable pouch. With just the right proportion of soybeans to popcorn this product comes from a company that celebrates food. Hooray!",5

You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner.",5

I guess the sugar all comes from the 100% juice itself. So much suger level is such a small can. That's kind of high...<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste and I think it's an enjoyable drink.

I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you.",4

B001O2IX8E,"We had the same issue with this product. Half the flat was improperly sealed, and resulted in an expired food issue.  But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up & turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these ""bad"" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to break.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Our baby did love this meal though - it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods.",2
B0029K0HBG,"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats",2

B003VXFK44,"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.",2

Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues.

B003EM7J9Q,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.

I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....",2

B000FFILBA,"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it.",4

Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills.",1

B0015UX574,"The texture and chewiness of these Winegums is just like the real deal.  They're not too soft like many of the imitation Winegums tend to be, so in that aspect, they're close to perfect.  However, the flavor is not the same, that's why I can't give them 5 stars.  These simply don't taste as good as the Maynard's, Bassett's, or some of the other kinds that can be found at European candy stores.<br /><br />The price on these is so incredibly fair that I had to give them 4 stars.  Also, once you've eaten a few of them and you overcome the initial expectations, the flavor actually begins to improve and they can be enjoyed quite vividly.  I love eating these while studying for my exams.<br /><br />I recommend them as a good alternative for the thrifty Winegums lover who is stuck in the USA and doesn't want to pay $50 on shipping to get the originals from Europe.",4

B002TSHYSW,"I was expecting some ""serious flavor"" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.",3

There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience.",1

I use the Keurig machine solely to get the hot water to brew the tea.  I have not tried the K-Cup Bigelow Green Tea, but I am wondering if the taste using the K-Cups justifies the much greater cost?  I am giving a 3 rating since I do not think the cost would be justifed to use the K-Cups in comparison the the Bigelow Green Tea Bags.  I welcome feedback from individuals who have tried the Bigelow Green Tea and the Bigelow Green Tea K-Cups.<br />Please read my updated comment.

Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa.

B002YLEPP4,"I purchased because I could no longer find the Target Archer Farms kettle corn flavor in my local store or online. This was not bad and much better than the stuff I'd purchased in my local grocery store, but not quite as good as the Archer Farms.  The only thing that was a bit of an annoyance was that it is very fine powder so it makes a mess when shaking onto your popcorn. Also the sodium is a little bit high per serving (75 milligrams per 1/4 tsp).  I wish that information had been in the description before I ordered it.  If you can tolerate the sodium this a great find and I would rate this 4 stars.  If you are watching your sodium then this may not be the product for you.  The 1/4 tsp serving size is not enough for 3 cups of popcorn.  For the sodium content & annoying messiness, I rate this 3 stars.",3
B004867T24,"The product came attractively packaged in a vacuum packed flat resealable plastic pouch. The tuna had a strong tuna smell, which immediately brought our cats running over to inspect. At 4.1 ounces, this is more of a meal than a treat. While you could cut off a piece and save the rest for another time, this isn't what I think of when buying kitty treats... Kitty treats to me are crunchy and small, so that I can shake the container to call our cats over and then sprinkle out a couple of treats at a time.<br /><br />With this prodcut, we replaced our usual Fancy Feast dinner and served our 2 cats the entire 4.1 ounce pouch. I found that it looked a little dry, but I will say that the cats gobbled up the food like it was their last meal.<br /><br />Overall, our cats seemed to like it, but I have some issues with the way the product is marketed. If this is to be used as a treat, it needs to be easier to serve in small pieces. If it is to be used as a meal, then the price needs to be lowered ALOT. I would never purchase this product as is.",2

BUT!!! Last time we bought Kamahi from the same Fast-Pak Trading Inc. in the local store-it was different honey! Although label says it's the same,but I know the taste and can say for sure-they put something different in the jar. It's more like clover honey,something cheaper and less tasty.

B000EVOSE4,"I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.",3

B003VKR0J0,"My son is 3 months old and was just diagnosed with reflux, we were told to try this formula as it is supposed to be the holy grail of formula's to help babies with reflux and spit up.<br /><br />My son did not seem to have a problem drinking this formula out of his level 1 nipple, as it is a heavier formula.<br /><br />As for the spitting up, which the thicker formula is supposed to help prevent by helping keep food in babies tummy versus mommys shirt, it was a nightmare. The amount of spit up my son experienced did not go down, if anything it increased. Ontop of that, of course it was a thicker, oatmeal like consistency. He spat up so horribly on this one time it soaked his whole front of his shirt and it was horrible to wipe off, you can't wipe off the chunks easily...<br /><br />Also, inside the tub in the scoop wrapper there is a pamphlet that says their special formula won't make your child constipated, could not be further from the truth!!! My baby has been on 4 other formulas for his reflux and has never had a constipation issue. I literally fed him 4 bottles of this formula and the poor kid had major poop issues.<br /><br />I would not reccomend this to a parent with an infant with reflux, research other formulas first and use this as a LAST RESORT! Not worth the $$.",1
B0014WYXQK,"Izze Beverages offers a variety of aromatic and refreshing line of drinks that are healthier and better-tasting alternative to soft drinks. Consisting of all natural ingredients (70% juice and sparkling water) and with no added sugars or caffeine, Izze's drinks are simply a better choice for you and your body. With a creative blend of juice concentrates -- for example, the pomegranate drink consists of apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate juice -- the taste experience is far, far superior to almost any drink you'll be likely to find in your local vending machine.<br /><br />Interestingly, Izze is packaged in 8.4 fluid ounce cans. A trade-off in using natural fruit juices is higher calorie content, so perhaps the tall, slim design of the can and its smaller volume is intended to help offset, both psychologically and materially, the reality of consuming an 80 calorie drink.<br /><br />However, Izze does not fare as well with competitive products from R.W. Knudsen whose drinks are made with 100% juice and are offered in 12 fluid ounce cans for about the same price as Izze. But perhaps more tellingly, Knudsen does not feel compelled to fortify their drinks with needless vitamins nor do they wear their corporate philanthropy on their sleeves to the extent that Izze feels compelled to do. One wonders if all this might be due to Pepsi's acquisition of Izze in 2006; the benefit of Pepsi's sales and distribution network might have come at the cost of marketing hyperbole and the production of a slightly less desirable product.<br /><br />Still, Izze shows that the soft drink industry is on the right track. If you normally consume artifically-sweetened soft drinks, choosing to enjoy the unique taste experience of Izze's all-natural product line (with delicious specialty flavors such as grapefruit and pomegranate) should be an easy decision for you to make. But if you are a little more finicky and prefer an 100% juice drink, you might also look into some of the other alternatives that are available to you.",3

B002NHYQAS,"For those wanting dark chocolate, this simply is going to do the trick.  It's 54% cocoa solids and really quite sweet.  In terms of texture, it's a bit grainier than average.  It's not shiny, but kind of matte, and melts pretty reasonably.<br /><br />Each 2.25 oz (64g) bar has six large-ish squares, making portion control a little challenging.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, this definitely earns a solid three stars.  It's really not bad at all, like a very reasonable cocoa.  It's so sweet that it tastes a little like a really high end milk chocolate at first, with a good finish for a milk chocolate.  All in all, for a dark chocolate this is better than Dove (less ""smooth"" because it's grainier, but definitely a better finish), but can't hold a candle to a good high end dark chocolate like Lindt.<br /><br />In terms of organic chocolates, Green & Black makes a darker, smoother, better finishing chocolate, and the bars are bigger, too.",3

B000Z978SS,After using erythritol in several recipes I've found that it tastes far better than alternate sweeteners like Splenda.  It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.,4
B006VY2THQ,I orderd the tea just for the tin. The regular tea came in just a box (I also ordered a refill) but he elephant tin never came even though it said it was in stock.

B001EO5UT2,This was exactly what I was looking for. My local Trader Joe's used to sell this during the holidays but stopped selling their liqueur cakes so I thought I was out of luck because I'd looked at other stores in my area. I never even thought of getting online to find it. It was a bit more pricey than I bought at the store but still delicious-so delicious I almost thought of using it as my wedding cake. It does have a very strong amaretto flavor which I love but my fiance thought it was a bit too strong.,4
B005CUU25G,"These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the ""lick but don't bite"" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors. The dogs didn't distinguish among them so unless you have a finicky pet, choice of flavor may not matter.",3

The beach sand residue left in my mouth from this thing is horrible. I've got half the bar sitting here in front of me, and I really don't think I can finish it off.

I'm a big guy, and I need a screw driver to actually open the damn thing - the lid and pull tab do not give enough torque to actually remove the lid without breaking the pull tab - or your finger. The top of the can says - in vey large letters around the pull top: ""OR USE CAN OPENER"" - but the lid is so recessed that a conventional can opener will not work, and the bottom of the can is too rounded.

B000I6PXLC,"The first batch I got must have been a bad batch, because it seemed to have a ""burned coffee"" smell, and smelled a bit more like chocolate raspberry or some other flavor rather than pure chocolate. It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor, and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Since then, I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times, however, when those burned flavor notes creep back in, depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon, Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker, oilier, and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder, more like Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee, even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean, as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices. Those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table I do not buy any longer. So this brand is no longer one that I will purchase. Plus they engage in farming activities that are not ecologically sound. I suggest starting with Intelligentsia.",5

B001EO5YAC,"This was my first time with Lavazza. The coffee was weak, light, flavor was OK but not what I was expecting from an Italian coffee. With the milk (cappuccino) it was barely present as taste.<br />I drink cappuccinos every day and I use a very good espresso machine and I can change the type of grind, and the strength and all that. No matter what combination I used it was just barely Ok.<br />If I could I would have returned the coffee.",2
B0007YZSYW,"I have to use a whole lot to have a little vanilla flavor, so it's not a good value. Vanilla extract works better everytime.<br />The bottle is beautiful, but not practical; the wire on top is very hard to move in order to open the bottle. Also, it's not a shaker; you have to spoon it out, because the metal cap (with holes in it) is held by a plastic cap underneath (which doesn't have holes)... What's the deal?",2

In fact I had gotten sunburn on my scalp in the part of my hair and this felt very gentle on that tender spot. So if the price suits you, it would be okay.",3

B003ANFMY8,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

B000S4DAF0,"My first cup of Rooibus was Numi which was very good to excellent. The only problem with it was the cost, about six bucks for 16 tea bags, locally, the Twinings was half the cost but so I decided that I should give it a try, I was terribly disappointed with the taste, aroma or lack of aroma, I also noticed that it didn't have a nice red hue like the Numi, it's more of brown color. I seriously doubt that I will finished the box, especially since receiving a 16 oz Bag of Davidson's, which I find very satisfying.<br /> Davidson's is my first bag of loose tea, it's a little extra trouble, but I believe that I will begin to prefer loose tea, I am already beginning to experiment with the recipe.<br /> In summary, with all the positive feedback for the Twinings Brand Rooibus, I would say give it a try, it's not expensive, but then try either the Numi or the Davidson's, with taste being so subjective, it's impossible for me to say which you will like the best, but I hope there is one that you will find satisfying.",2

B001CWV4PA,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these crackers - I am always a bit wary of trying GF products since so many have a strange taste and/or texture. These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.<br /><br />Good:<br />- They taste good and have a really nice texture.<br />- I don't think they are exceptionally bland - they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers<br />- I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Cost<br />- Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of broken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.<br /><br />That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3-4x as much as ""glutinized"" crackers) for a box of broken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally.",4

B001EO5OSO,I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.,1

B0013NUGDE,"But healthier than most of the other snacks I cram into my mouth(and that's gotta be worth something right?).  They taste good too!  Kinda sweet, kinda salty.  They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.  Another interesting Popchips feature is that they are ""popped""(hence the name, again, makes sense) rather than fried or baked... gives it an oriental rice snack kind of consistency.  All in all very pleased with these, give them a try for yourself, whether a health nut or not(a .8 oz bag of these is about 1/3rd the fat and half the rest of the nutrition facts numbers of a full oz of Lays for the record).",4

The other reviewers are right that this repellent only last for a couple hours at best.  But when it is still fresh, it does remarkably well.  My backyard was full of mosquitos during the summer & it was hell mowing my lawn back there.  After applying a little of this, you could actually see them wanting to approach you or landing on you and they then they start flying away in disgust.  It doesn't have any offensive odors as well.  But I decided to go with another repellent that claims 6-hour coverage, but was a bit more expensive.  So, in the end, this would be an excellent product if it could last longer & was water resistant.",3

I brewed my first cup this morning & it smelled VERY strong of coconut so of COURSE I couldn't wait to try it.  After it cooled down a bit I took my first sip.  AMAZING!!  It is quite delightful & I STRONGLY recommend it if you like coconut coffee.  No bitter aftertaste, either & no soot @ the bottom of my cup.  Awesome",5

I occasionaly add hazelnut non-dairy creamer as a sweet treat to my coffee and the bitterness still comes through over the hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />My latest on the go experiment that seems to make it more palate tolerant, is brewing 7 ounces of Revv and adding 5 ounces of a milder medium roast coffee to it in the travel cup.  It still has the bite, but with a reasonable amount of sweetner the bitterness seems to be dulled to an acceptable level.<br /><br />K-cup container 1 star if not less.<br />I've made 5 cups of this coffee,  The  5 K-cups I've used today have had the lids come unsealed during brewing, resulting in a god awful mess of coffee flowing around the K-cup holder, out all gaps in the brewer itself and coffee grounds all over the place, in the coffee, in the brewer, in the K-cup holder.

B000G6MBUA,"The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette.",1
B0043FC4GQ,"First of all, I have to say that I got excellent service for a product that was not sold by Amazon but, shipped by them.  They came in the same shipment as another pumpkin-flavored product, Carbon's Golden Malted pancake and waffle mix, that I had ordered.<br /><br />The waffles were and are wonderful!  The Pop-tarts tasted dry and stale.  The frosting kind of cracks off and there is not much filling.  The filling does not taste like pumpkin!  It tastes sugary but, not particularly like anything else.  I opened two different packets and had the same result.  They were bad.  I tasted them and ended up throwing them out.  I tried one plain out of the package and I tried toasting the other.  It didn't make any difference.  What a waste of time and money!",2

B001LGGH40,"Switch Kiwi Berry is a good tasting, lightly carbonated fruit beverage that offers the great taste of natural fruit juice without any preservatives or man- made chemicals. Switch blends fruit juice concentrates with just the right amount of carbonation for a balance that is refreshing without being too bubbly.<br /><br />Switch manufactures several different flavors of its beverages and kiwi berry is one of several fruit- flavored options. I tend to prefer the taste of citrus, but I love the taste of berries also, provided the blend is just right. Switch Kiwi Berry offers a very good- tasting blend that captures flavors like strawberry and kiwi, along with apple, grape, raspberry, and other natural flavors. The kiwi and the strawberry are most noticeable, but if you search, you will also realize there is a small amount of grape, apple, and other fruits to produce the right balance and right smoothness.<br /><br />Switch Kiwi Berry is great for those who are concerned about their health. This beverage is all natural, contains no preservatives, no added sugar, no corn syrup, no artificial colors, and no gluten. Of course, the fact that there is no added sugar doesn't mean that no sugar exists. There is actually a pretty significant number of grams of natural sugar in each serving, as well as a significant number of calories. These numbers will make Switch unacceptable to those on low carb diets.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, however, Switch Kiwi Berry is a very tasty beverage with lots of sweet berry taste, a full day's supply of vitamin C, and no preservatives. It offers all- natural composition with a taste that is sweet and satisfying and a carbonation level that is just enough to make it refreshing without going overboard.",4
B004565GV8,"I am addicted to this gum. It tastes so close to the real thing and doesn't lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry. This best flavor of all of this series, along with the mint chocolate chip.",5
B0031U9VI8,"It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal.

B000SATIG4,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling.",2
B004391DK0,"Like the title says, I have tried (nearly) all the brands, spent a lot of money, and in the end these are the best Gluten Free Pancakes I've had.<br /><br />I am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. But a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.<br /><br />I am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. Other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.<br /><br />Compared to the many other brands, these do not have a ""funny"" taste or smell from odd flours. These are made mostly from Rice and Potato flours. You just feel NORMAL.<br /><br />I hope they will come out with a ""whole grain"" version from Brown Rice and Bean flour.<br /><br />TIP: To get the fluffiest texture use BUTTER instead of oil.

B000IHNCQO,"They are hard and crunchy, very salty, and with a hint of a burnt taste. They are gritty after chewing and need to be washed down with some water.

They were not packed very well when shipped and arrived somewhat damaged, I had to glue two of the boxes back together.The salt is of medium coarseness, the salt to herb ratio is 3/4 to 1/4 respectably. It's not a great deal initially but the boxes are reusable and it is quite easy to make more using the ingredient list on the side of each box!",4

B002NHYQAS,"I am surprised to see so many strong negative reviews for ""Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar"". Personally, I find the taste to be delicious; it (the taste) is rich in chocolate flavor, while also avoiding the overly-sweet sugar taste that is common with lower-end chocolate confections. ""Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar"" also manages to minimize the bitter taste that is common for dark chocolate, which is a huge plus for me, considering that I am not a big fan of dark chocolate in the first place.<br /><br />In all, highly recommended.",4
B005SPQENY,"The tea and the passion fruit flavor were good, a little on the sweet side for me. Plus it left an aftertaste that was a bit too intense. It didn't have a refreshing feel to it like I usually get from tea or fruit drinks. Also, there was a lot of pulp in the bottle. It was thick, plump, big and chunky. I tried shaking the bottle vigorously but that didn't help break it up. The pulp stayed consistently firm. It ruined the drink for me. You might like this if you enjoy lots of pulp and in fairly large pieces but it wasn't right for me.",2

B001OCKIP0,"I'm a muesli eater who tries a granola every once in a while to see if I've changed my mind and decided I like it any better. Like other granolas, this one did not convince me to switch. My basic gripe about granolas is that they get that crunchiness from sugars. That's true here as well, although the sugars have fancier names -- plus you have chocolate added.<br /><br />The ingredients of this product are as follows: whole grain rolled oats, semi-sweet chocolate chunks (chocolate, sugar, dextrose, cocoa butter, etc), evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, brown rice flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, molasses, vitamin E (to preserve flavor), natural flavor.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, but since I really enjoy muesli more anyway, I guess I still don't see much of a reason to switch to granola. I'm glad I tried this product, but it seemed pretty much like a typical granola to me.<br /><br />If you want a chocolaty granola, this could be a great product for you.",3

B002IEZJMA,"This Illy ""Italian Espresso Style"" drink is one of an entire series of coffee-in-a-can style beverages.  This particular product has 6.8 fl oz and contains 155 mg of caffeine. That's pretty typical of a regular cup of coffee.<br /><br />The taste was pretty basic. In fact, it really just tastes like chilled coffee. It has that bitter coffee bite, somewhat toned down by sugar. It isn't too strong, but if you're looking for a smooth, milky taste then you won't like this drink. Overall, it was okay but certainly not my favorite. It'll do in a pinch as an iced coffee substitute, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.",3

One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3.

B0045XE32E,"I'm one of those fussy dog owners that read labels and annoy others and so I really like the ingredients in this and think this would be a 5 star product for a lot of owners. My dogs certainly liked the flavor, but they aren't a fussy crew -- still, I feel good about this biscuits. The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs -- my greyhound and my sheltie -- are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to break into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years. My dachshund also has to work to crunch through it due to the size -- remember, couldn't break it -- and the hardness, but she managed.<br /><br />If you have a medium and up dog with good teeth, them this is quite highly recommended. If you're constantly looking for a softer treat, they're less ideal and might at least need a little soak.",4

B004R8J8E0,"I have never tried any of the Shake N Bake products before.  I was mainly attracted to it because most breadings made from scratch require egg or milk and some sort of crumb, and I don't always have those ingredients on hand.  The Shake N Bake for pork only requires a bit of water to dampen the chops and the contents of the pouch -- couldn't be easier.<br /><br />I used some very inexpensive ""special purchase"" chops; they were thin but huge, not the conventional center or loin cuts, and one of them was more than enough for dinner.<br /><br />I was only making three big chops, so instead of putting the mix in a zip bag, I just poured some of the mix on a plate and dipped the chops in.  Very easy.  There was plenty of mix left, so it was a very economical meal.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, it was okay, not bad but not great.  We specifically tasted paprika and onion powder.  I would prefer flavors that blend a bit better.<br /><br />The cheap chops came out very juicy and tender with the Shake N Bake.<br /><br />The covering was also a bit unexpected.  It is very fine and a bit grainy, not a bread crumb texture.<br /><br />We microwaved the leftovers the next day, and I would not recommend doing that because they got soggy.  The chops probably should have been warmed up in a toaster oven or maybe a skillet on low heat.",3

B0062A87HA,"I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  ""caveat emptor.""",1

B002LANN56,"""Grilled Sirloin"" sounds great for a dog food, and my dog was sniffing the package and followed me from the door to the kitchen with intense interest. He was more interested in this food than many types of treats he has had. So, if your dog is a picky eater who would lose weight rather than eat a food that doesn't interest it (I have had a dog like this), then this might be a viable choice for you in order for you to get your dog to eat.<br /><br />On the flip side, if your dog has no problems at mealtimes and you want to provide him/her a healthy meal at a fair price, you may want to keep looking. My dog eats 4 cups of his regular food, maintains his weight and energy and has good stools. With this food, he needs about seven cups and a couple more trips outside each day. More food and more waste, because less food/volume is being absorbed by the dog. Less nutrition and more fillers. Pet food manufacturers often split up a filler food into separate types (soy meal/soy flour) so that a meat type will move to first in line of ingredients. First up is ""Beef"" although not specified as grilled sirloin or not, it is still generally better than foods that start with four types of corn product or a meat byproduct. This also has poultry byproduct meal, plus 3 soy ingredients, 2 wheats, brewers rice, corn, barley,  and 4+ artificial colorings. While it is not the worst dog food on the market, it is certainly not the best, and certainly not at this price point.

If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird ""tin can"" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product.",5

B000F9Z1WI,"One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

I admit, it smells better than most cat foods.  They prefer it at room temp.<br />The reason I listed the lack of fiber is that one of the cats has taken to ripping up the carpet with his teeth!

I would have never been able to drink it it was so strong.  That's the part where I am unsure of -- I am definitely not a fan of strong coffee.

B000SDKDM4,"I tasted Lavazza many times being in Italy as well in France and excellent quality (taste, smell) of it can't be confused with anything else. Have to regret - I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with this ""Lavazza Super Crema"" beans from Amazon - it's under-roasted, bitter and acid taste, weak (yes, there was a typo) and unpleasant smell and crema....well, even relatively old coffee beans from TJ Maxx produce better crema with proper grind&tamping or even just with the pressurized portafilter.<br />I'm using semi-automatic espresso machine (DeLongi BAR32 before and now Saeco Aroma, Breville BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder) about 5 years (I mean I'm not a novice for espresso), and have tried this beans immediately after the bag was opened (1st ""news"" - very weak smell), used fresh grind, careful and dense tamping, machine is properly heated and primed.<br />The consumption date on the package marked as October of 2011 and I know that Lavazza's shelf life is 14 months - therefore, received in March 2010, it's 6 months old roast, not too fresh but I had used much older roasts without any problems. Not sure how it works for latte but as espresso coffee it's wasted money and lost expectation. Don't be fooled by positive reviews - some people never tried the real espresso and some even don't like it but coffee-infused milk drink. Also note that Amazon sells some Lavazza coffee's for much higher price and no ""subscription"" proposed. The attractive price($16 per kg with subscription)is definitely result of poor quality - something wrong with this ""Lavazza Super Crema"" coffee.",2

B00471KCZG,"I really wanted to like this syrup, first because I can't eat much sugar and second because it's made in my home state and I like to support local businesses. Also the ingredients are high quality and all natural.  I picked 4 different flavored bottles up at a Home Goods store and was anxious to try it. Unfortunately this was really bitter for me, as almost all products with stevia are. (Truvia in iced tea seems to be an exception, perhaps because the bitterness enhances the tea flavor.)I'm a supertaster, which means I have more tastebuds than most. It also means that anything with stevia will always have a funky bitter taste to me, no matter how hard it is masked. I was hoping the Lo Han Guo would help ease the bitterness but it didn't. I tried it in milk and the only way to get rid of the bitterness was to pour a lot more milk in the cup, but then the almond flavor washed out too. In short I'm giving this a three, because even though I didn't like it, the quality of the ingredients will ensure that it will probably be very tasty for others who are not supertasters.",3

B000W5SLB8,"My dog has severe allergies to just about everything it seems, so I was advised by my vet to switch to some rarer foods, like venison and fish. The feed store didn't have anything pure venison, so I got this instead. I have no idea how my dog would have reacted to this food, if he would still be allergic or not because he flat-out refused to eat it. He went a day and a half without eating anything, and getting worried, I put back down the food I knew he was allergic to. He gobbled it up the second the bowl touched the floor, so I know he was hungry, just not wanting to eat this food. I know the old food didn't have anything to do with it either, because after that fiasco, I special ordered California's Best new venison formula food, and my dog loved it. He just doesn't like bison apparently, which is odd because the food he was on was the red meat formula of EVO. I would think going from beef to bison wouldn't be that big a change, but it was to my dog's nose. So I'm giving it three out of five stars; this might be a good food health-wise, but smell-wise, it turned my dog off to the point he was willing to starve himself rather than eat it, and he's a food motivated dog. He never turns his nose up to anything. Oh, and if it matters to anyone, my dog is a 65 pound boxer/catahoula mix.",3

B001BDDTB2,"Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat.",3

B000FFPXJ8,I bought this product based on [...]<br /><br />I liked the taste but it has very high sugar content.I am trying to lose weight and more than 15g of sugar per day severely affects belly fat.<br />So after using couple of times I gave away rest,3
B001HBTGI8,This stuff is outragous. It is simply the best olive juice on the market. I tried another brand and it did not come close to Boscoli. This stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. I would highly recommend this product.,5
B000OK7UDG,"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing.",1

B002PO09MS,"Fondarific usually has glowing reviews... everyone on the cake forums seems to love it.  My batch was either old or just crap.  Very disappointing.  Will go back to making marshmallow fondant.... cheaper and WAY easier to work with.  Also bought the black but didn't open it because the white was such crap.  Had to use it because I ran out of time to make MMF for the cake I was making... DUE TO THE FACT THAT I PRE-PURCHASED fondant to use.<br /><br />I love working with Fondant, and thought that maybe I'd use something easier this time, but it wasn't.  Good luck with this.<br /><br />Taste however, was quite good.",1
B001710K60,"I bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a ""good"" steak at home.<br />The first ones we cooked....could hardly cut with a steak knife.<br />The second time we tried them, I tenderized for quite some time.<br />They were more edible that way, but still nothing better than I could have bought at the local grocery store.<br /><br />Except for the packaging, there is nothing good I can say about these steaks.<br />If you figure the price per pound, these steaks should cut with a butter knife.<br /><br />Will never buy again.",1
B002AQP516,"These are good in a pinch, especially since they don't need milk, which I always seem to be out of (no little ones at home). Although the other Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that do require milk has a better texture and fluff up better, with these you just need to watch the amount of water, or they'll end up too thin. They have a slight butter taste without that fake butter taste. Serve them up plain, with butter, with gravy, or any other way.<br />Now, I'm off to order more...",4
B004EKO2HE,"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",1
B004CPCQBK,I ordered 3 bottles of Heinz Yellow Mustard (17oz Upside down).  What I received was 6 bottles of Heinz Spicy Brown Mustard (17oz Upside down).  I have tried to contact the shipper but to date........No response.  I wish I could make these purchases all of the time.......Pay for 3 and receive 6.  Amazon Marketplace really DOES NOT work for me.  I would not suggest using Amazon Marketplace to anyone.,2
B000EGX2EG,"The negative reviews of Mrs Mays products just because it is made in China are not really valid, cannot base on other companies' poor quality control and apply to every company in the country!  There are many bad quality foods that are made in the USA that's bad for your health, so just because it's labeled made in USA doesn't mean it is good quality.  As long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales.",5

B004CLCEDE,"NO RETURN!  NO REFUND!  The texture of all of the Miracle Noodle products is like eating plastic fishing worms.  I read the reviews and tried every way possible to improve the experience of eating this stuff.  5 minutes of rinsing, par boiling etc.  When you buy this item you are stuck with it.  Amazon.com will not stand behind the quality of your experience.  Don't take a chance of losing $80 like I did.",1
B004UHL0IA,I agree with the other reviewer. I bought this from a local store because I could not wait to try it....the flavor sounded so good. What a letdown!!! I was choking after the first sip from the completely awful taste! Don't waste your money like I did.,1
B000G6MBX2,"I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir",5
B001ACMCNA,"My SO and I love this crust.  When making it looks like it is not going to become dough like because so little liquid is used.  However just keep kneading and it will come together.  The first time  we made it, it did have a slight after taste but only two or three bites in the whole pizza.  So we used a recipe posted in the review about using 3/4 a cup of olive oil drizzled in slowly while kneading and the dough came out a almost the same as before but no after taste this time.",4
B000LRFVN8,this is the 1st time i have used the balocco brand. it worked well for the tiramisu although i don't think they tasted as good as the last brand i bought. i would buy this again but i would have to adjust my recipe to help the taste.,3
B00141QYSQ,"I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.  This treat seems to cause them to be overly excited and even after eating, they would go to extremes to try to get more.  Good motivator.  But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super ""high"" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.  I wish the pieces were a little smaller since they are about a quarter size (too big for my small dogs). Recommended not more than 2 pcs a day for small dog under 20lbs.",4
B0052UQ6M4,The package as well as the contents are small in this product.  You don't get much for the purchase.  Probably something to pass on even if you are a milka lover.,2
B0000DG4MK,"As usual, I took this sauce to work and had everyone try it as it wasn't that hot. To a person they all loved it. It is great on a roast beef or pastrami sandwich. Excellent flavor profile. You should be thinking of things mustard might go on when using this. Not really hot at all to me, but I just stomached a dollop of Da' Bomb The Final Answer so I can't really be relied upon in that aspect.",4
B002QWP89S,Just because you see 96 treats on the box your crazy if you think that's how many your buying everyone knows 96 really means 45,1
B0009OMU00,I absolutely love this mix.  We keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it.,5
B0015TZAY6,These chips taste great. I use them mostly as a topping on my garden salads I make at home. They give it a great crunch and sweet taste that makes the salad so much better. They also make a great and healthier snack.,4
B004WM0ZTS,I am a very picky coffee drinker...I was so surprised at the flavor of the Italian roast...8oz to 10oz of water is all you need. I run the water through the one cup coffer maker. It's important to put the coffee in first and stir while hot water is coming through. I guess you could just micro the water and pour it over the coffee in another mug...great for home or travel..we all know hotel coffee is terrilbe.<br />LLHB  ENJOY!,5
B000F4EU52,"I was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit (which I normally won't touch).  In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work, so that I can have a fruit snack easily even if I was too busy or forgot to bring lunch.  So far I haven't gotten a can that had any problems.  The watermelon isn't crunchy - of course not! - but it's good, and certainly not ""slimy"".",5
B000BPR1AQ,I am a fishing guide. I spend more time than most trying to ward off pesky misquitos. I have been useing cutter products with good success. I saw the reviews and decided to try the cutter advanced....Advanced means better right?...WRONG! ..Big Mistake!! This stuff is almost worthless. It may be better than nothing but I have apllied  3 times as much 5 times as often. Despite this..  I am continually being eaten alive by misquitos using this product. Its a wonder to me that it is still on the market? Do Not waste your money like I did.,1
B000CONMBS,Sent it to my daughter for a care package and she was blown away. Highly recommended for late night studying.,4
B003QBCUR6,I was a huge skeptic when this first came out but no longer.  I can't get over how good this instant coffee tastes.  It's better than what I can grind and brew myself.  I have these on my desk at work now for making decaf ice coffee in the afternoons.  It costs 1/4 of what they'd charge me at the store and I can get decaf.  Awesome.  I am truly shocked how good this coffee is.<br /><br />I just wish they sold it in large containers for making full pots.,5
B002GJ9JWS,Adds a great low calorie peanut butter flavor to smoothies.  Mix with jam and a fabulous peanut butter sandwich.  So many options ... so little time,4
B000X5Q984,"We have tried the log, thick slice, and thin slice versions.  The thinner the slice, the faster to cook and overcook.  We never found the correct way to cook this without causing it to dry out.  We never steamed it.  We prefer the thicker slice version.<br /><br />The high cost we assume is based on four factors; high density product, reduced fat, high spice content, and presumably using better cuts of meat.  When fat is reduced, the desired flavor profile requires more spices, but makes cooking more difficult.<br /><br />The texture is closer to hard (than soft) salami.  The fat content appears much less than bologna or spam lite.  Spam does have hints of ham flavor after slow frying; not discerned in (this brand of) pork roll. Excepting any ham flavor, the flavor profile is stronger and better than (regular) bologna and distinct from spam, in our opinion.  The first time we tried it, everyone designated it as ""Beverly Hills spam.""  Unlike my former acquaintances from Jersey and Philly, we were not won over, but understood their longing for memorable home foods.<br /><br />Our local Publix carries the thin sliced version and the one-pound mini-log ($8), whereas we previously ordered online or found it while traveling.  If you elect to try it, invite some friends over for a sharing experience...just ensure you have practiced cooking it to your satisfaction before offering it to a group.  We shared our log at a family gathering and also received the routine comment...""It reminds us of spam.""",3

B0030VJ97Q,I make my own baby food but when we travel I give my daughter plum organics and happy baby food. She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip.,2

B003WREBIK,"As others have stated, the Arctic Zero Cookies and Cream isn't what you expect. The cookie part of it is just crushed cookie powder mixed in with the ice cream and not the traditional larger pieces of chocolate cookie (like Oreo cookies) with vanilla ice cream. Also, the flavor was just weird. Not quite vanilla-like. There was a hint of nuttiness. Maybe hazel nut or maple syrup.<br /><br />After eating the Arctic Zero Vanilla Maple flavor, I realized that the base for the Cookies and Cream flavor are the SAME! All they did was add crushed cookies to it! And, that was where the nutty, hazelnut-like, maple syrup-like flavor was coming from!<br /><br />Pretty lame if you ask me!!!!",2
B004CH9U2G,"Just got a shipment of bulk candy for Christmas (reds and whites).  Honestly kind of disappointed in the taste, not horrible but rather chalky and artificial tasting.  Also I think the fact that they only use the ""sunflower kernel"" rather than a ""sunflower seed"" may make a noticable difference.  I got the idea after buying a few packs of Sunny Seed Drops[...] which are delicious but more expensive and I don't see any Christmas varieties on Amazon (they do have other varieties).  In this case you get what you pay for.  If I had to do it over again I would buy a smaller quantity from Sunflower Food & Spice Co.<br /><br />No issues with shipping, packaging, etc.",2
B000NCXRSM,"Wonderful seasoning for the barbecue ""rub"" on chicken, meats, etc. Smoky paprika really enhances the flavour of the barbecued slow roasted delicacies.

Hence: Barbecue.",5
B001CWV4PA,"These taste fine, like a fancy cracker rather than a saltine.  My only issue with them is the packaging.  They come in two bags inside the box, and many are cracker pieces.

B0062A87HA,"Ordered a 12 pack of 15 ounce cans of pumpkin.  Received the order and about 10 of the cans were dented or bent (some severely).  The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping.  The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box.  It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans.  I considered returning the order but needed it right away.  I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies.  The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable.  I do not intend to order from this vendor again.",2
B000HDMW6K,"To me these are just average.  They're not great, and there's nothing off-putting about them.  They're the medium size fishies that get called ""sardines"", and not the more expensive tiny fishes (which taste better in my opinion), and not the herring that show up in the really cheap sardine cans.<br /><br />The easy-open can is a great idea.  No more splattering tomato sauce over myself when despite my best efforts to open a metal can correctly I just don't do it with quite the right touch.<br /><br />The problem is that I've been spoiled by the little sardines, and I just can't see myself staying with these.  I'll finish off what I bought (and enjoy those easy-open cans, but I won't buy them again.",3

B003EML8PM,These are soooo good but make sure you shake the bag and evenly spread the pieces out within the bag and micro for about 70-90 seconds depending on  your microwave. Always keep an eye on the bag once it blows up to its full area DON'T let it go for any longer than 20 seconds or they will burn and with the hot and spicy your kitchen and your eyes will feel like you have been pepper sprayed. Little more difficult to cook but its worth it. Enjoy,5
B000EH2AMA,"In my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types, this is one of my new favorites.  Great taste, and although a hefty calorie count, the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run, if a real meal just is not an option!  VERY satisfying.  I also tried the white sesame crunch, and that is ok too, but this one wins for taste.",4
B000W4OQRW,"FYI:  These tasty-looking cookies contain fish.<br /><br />If you aren't vegetarian, none of this will probably matter to you.  Nor should it.  If you are vegetarian, read on . . .<br /><br />This product kept coming up in my recommendations here on Amazon so, when I spied it at Global Food, I picked it up.  Being vegetarian, I'm used to checking the ingredients of any new product I try.  I was disappointed to find that these cute 'lil mushroom cookies contain fish oil, so I can't eat them.  Too bad, considering how much everyone seems to like them.  I think it's kind of a bummer that I keep seeing fish oil used in cookies when there are other options that would make a product edible to a greater portion of the population.

Other than that I cannot say I would buy this coffee.  My husband liked it; I can take it or leave it.

B0041NYV8E,"If you love food that leaves your mouth burning long after a Mexican meal, and if you adore the taste of ginger, you'll love this beverage. Over-poweringly- piquant and heavily overwhelmed with the taste of ginger, this hot drink would really warm you up on that cold winter night. I am mad about ginger, and I crave spicy foods that burn my mouth for hours, so I enjoyed this beverage, once. All this said, I didn't love it, and I won't buy it. The ginger is overpowering, even for me, almost completely masking the light lemon and honey taste.<br /><br />If you are craving a rich, sweet drink to warm you up, this is not it. If you don't enjoy mouth-burning delicacies, this is not for you! However, ginger is very therapeutic for certain health conditions, so this may be a more appropriate use for this product.",2

B001LGGH40,"""The Switch"" reminds me a lot of carbonated apple cider. It has a carbonated sweet taste (with no sugar added, no preservatives according to the label). The label states that it has 100% Juice. To me it tastes light, on the diluted side, and very similar in taste to the apple cider bottle you serve kids for thanksgiving instead of real champagne. There is a slightly detectable taste of strawberry and maybe kiwi.<br /><br />Pros:<br />100% Vitamin C<br />Low Sodium of 15mg<br />Tastes good if you like the light carbonated Perrier-Like Taste.<br />Fat: 0mg<br /><br />Cons:<br />33g of sugar (although it says no sugar added)<br />34g of carbs - too much carbs if you're trying to cut down on carbs<br /><br />Conclusion: Keep in mind that this review reflects my personal opinion of the product beside the facts listed on the can. I personally prefer less carbonated fruit drinks with a stronger taste rather than the very light taste of this product. it is 135 calories for 8.3 fl oz. You also feel you need a glass of water to wash out the after taste. Overall, it tastes good and I can recommend it to anyone who's not trying to cut down on the amount of daily carbs or sugar intakes.",3
B000AY9U20,"Since this seems to be a main concern, I thought I would start with saying that all packages of cookies arrived intact along with a lot of other items I had ordered. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are very good tasting cookies. These taste like real chocolate chip cookies that crumble in your mouth and chocolate in every bite. The flavoring is great for packaged cookie. Yes, I would rather have a cookie home baked and out of the oven. But I will buy these again. I would recommend them for when you just don't feel like baking. For its price, it is the best chocolate chip cookie so far I have had shipped to the house.",4

They were obviously packed by an incompetent employee - who just put the tray of cans in the bottom of a much larger box and threw a couple of pieces of bubble wrap on top.  Both cartons arrived with no external damage, but the heavy cans had shifted around, in one carton 3 were open, with soup spilled around.  In both boxes, several cans were dented.  This was not the shipping carrier's fault - this was just incredibly poor packing.  I sent a photo and described the damage in the packaging review that was available right after purchase.  Amazon did not bother to even acknowledge that.  Beware of ordering any canned products from Amazon, I certainly will not do it again.",1
B005CUU25G,"I love the idea of the Lickety Stik:  a dog treat without all the extra calories.  Unfortunately, the design of this product makes it difficult to use.  The roller ball is very firmly fitted into the top so that it doesn't really roll.  It's mostly stuck in one position unless I manipulate it with my fingers (which are then covered in a strongly-smelling liquid that is difficult to wash off).  My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this ""treat"", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution.",3
B004K30HO2,"I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!",2
B004NNFEA6,"I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say, that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good, but spectacularly good! They have a very rich, buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting.",5
B0045XE32E,"My dog loves this stuff.  No dog I've offered it to has rejected it.  The treats are hard, so older dogs and/or dogs with teeth issues will have a hard time.  The treats, even when broken in half, are about an inch square and 1/4-inch thick, so small dogs may have problems as well.  They don't crumble easily, so transporting them in one's pockets doesn't leave one with a gooey mess after doing laundry.  I'm pretty sure they are pricier than the treats one gets at the supermarket, but I'd spring for them once or twice a year for special treats, as opposed to the ""normal"" treats I give Bruno when he is doing what he's supposed to do even though he'd like to be doing something else.",4
B006N3IG4K,I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.,5
B007TGDXMK,"I love my Keurig.  I was happy to find a less expensive product to put in it and I liked the concept of the plastic free packaging.<br /><br />But, this rainforest blend tastes like rainwater.  It smells like wet cigarettes.  We are very disappointed.",2
B004MO6NI8,"I thought this product was going to put me through the roof in a whirlwind of hyper activity. It did not. I didn't even get a boost of energy during or right after drinking it. I am not a caffine or energy drink user. I have 1 cup of coffee every morning and that is it so I figured this might really have an impact on me. It has not. It did not taste very good and made the corners of my mouth sticky. Also, one should not consume anything that shares the universal logo for poison.<br />On the plus side it does have a very large can, so while it may not taste great, at least you get a lot of it.",1
B001E5DZTS,"This is by far the best tasting thing that's come from a goat in years! Bullsburg Creamery, Man Chowder Dairy or Goat Coat can't hold a candle to this stuff. Drink it, bake it, snort it...it's all good.",5
B00283LQR8,"My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like ""people food"" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well.....",3
B000EDG4TE,"These came fresh, and sprout well for me. I am very pleased with them. They make a tasty and nutritious addition to our salads. As usual, Amazon delivery and postage was great with the super saving shipping option.",5

B003ZXG0VW,"Deliciousness procured without bracing cold winds and fellow greedy Girl Scout cookie fanantics in front of Walmarts, Kmarts, supermarkets, etc. There is one small difference that I want to note: the coconut is toasted more Keebler-wise, and is thus a bit harder to masticate. (Well, actually, you are just really conscious of the difference between the GS version and the baker-elves version while chewing; this ruminating causes you to either chew more or just think that you are chewing more. Blast it!) Other than that, all else is the same. Astounding. Exercise is a must afterwards. (Note: One star detained due to coconut being pretty close to dried grass. Also, the elves' version of ""Thin Mints"" is right on.)",4
B000FNB3AI,"The only good thing I can say about the Lemon Gluten Free cookies is that they really do have a good lemon flavor! The texture was like sand. In fact it was very much like a slab of wet sand with a good lemon flavor. Sorry to say, but I spent lots of money on this and am now stuck with what I consider inedible products.",1
B005HGAVGK,"We definately got a nice assortment of K-Cups but were really looking forward to trying the Peach tea which was not included in our shipment. I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog, French Toast, and a third winter type flavor. Slightly misleading from what is pictured.",3

B001TZU18Q,I love white polenta but most of what I find in the U.S. is very coarse.  It still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.  Moretti Polenta Friulana Bianco is amazing - the creamiest and finest I have ever seen.,5
B0036FOV2O,"I love dark roast, strong and robust coffees and thought this was a good choice based on the reviews.  Upon opening the bag, the aroma was pungent and acidic, and the beans appeared over-roasted and had an oily appearance.  When I made the first batch my wife observed that the aroma was off-putting, nowhere near the pleasant character some reviewers raved about.  The taste was simply awful - way over-roasted, with an unpleasant harshness that reminded me of burned Chickory or an over-strong Sumatran rather than a quality African coffee.  We finally decided to blend this 50/50 with a medium roast Colombian and that toned it down enough to restore some drinkability.  Most disappointing because I believe the reviewers who loved it likely got a good batch - we most certainly did not...",1
B000KFXEYE,"I ran into this product at a bed and breakfast.  Unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component, the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate.  You don't get just a hint of it that soon gets lost.  You taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip....very very enjoyable.  Highly recommend.",5
B000F9Z1WI,"Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.",4
B0002IZD16,"Bull Dog's Chuno has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen.  I've used it in everything: marinades, rice, stir fries, vegetables, etc.  I've also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces.  It also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce.  If I had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce.  Everytime I want to change a dish up a bit, I use chuno.  I've bought mine from somewhere else and didn't know it came in larger sizes.  The offering here is almost double the size, but it's also almost triple the price.  However, if the place I buy it from were to stop, I'd buy it here without fail.  I just wish they had the 50% less salt version.",5

That's why I call it heaven.<br />But who are you?<br />I am Sleepytime Judy and I am asleep.<br /><br />What welcome relief, knowing there is a pleasant, calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down. Just walk to the kitchen, put the kettle on, pull out a Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime teabag, place in a favorite cup--mine is a slender version of a Blue Willow cup, pour on water at just the boiling point, and wait for the tea to steep.<br /><br />Meanwhile, pick up the box--how many times now--and read the the words.<br />""100% Natural Herb Tea, Caffeine Free.""<br />""a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses...""<br />""...it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world...""<br />'The sweetest way I think of you is when the day is done.'

All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.<br /><br />I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping.

B002ESMUYK,"I figured this coffee would be great from seeing the good reviews. I'm starting to think they are from the company.

The coffee itself tastes okay, but it doesn't taste how it should. I expected better from this company since I love their other flavors.",2
B001ULH8NU,"I would never buy these peanuts again.  The're as crunchy in as almost tasting stale.  No peanut taste at all!  If you like VERY crunchy peanuts, maybe you might like them....not me. If you're ever in Jupiter Florida come by my house and I will give you both 32 oz. cans!",2
B001EQ5EJQ,"wow.  I read the great feedback on this product and took the plunge and was not disappointed.  We had bought some other walnut oil at WF and this one blows that out of the water.

B0058AMY74,"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo.

B0051OPWGC,"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore.""",3
B001ULH7P4,"It is marked as a 24 count on the web page, but when I recieved my order the box is only a 12 count.... makes the variety twice the cost as the individual flavors.  I love the product, just think Amazon should take the 24 count expectation off if they are only going to send one box.",3

Well, at first I wasn't sure about this one but as soon as I looked at the ingredients list and recognized EVERY item and seasoning I instantly became comfortable with the idea of this being edible; turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, rice milk powder, etc. This may not be macaroni and cheez but Namaste is a great tasting pasta meal so Im glad I chose to try it because I love it and maybe you will, too.",5
B0000WKU8K,"I have been making okonomiyaki quite often lately, but I have always topped it with American mayo, like Hellman's or Duke's.  I finally bought some Kewpie today because I kept hearing about how it's so much better for okonomiyaki.  I must say that I'm not really a fan.  It just tastes like Miracle Whip (I've always hated it) with MSG.  I'll be sticking with the American stuff after this is gone.",3

B000FF77YM,"As a gum addict, I was looking for a natural alternative to the artificial-flavor/artificial-sweetener varieties. This gum is great. Now, the flavor comes from real peppermint, so it's not going to last as long as the fake stuff, nor it will be as mind-blowingly intense as some of the new super-flavored gums.  But if that's ok with you and you'd like to chew something that doesn't put weird chemicals into your body, this is for you.  It's expensive, sadly, but what can you expect?

B001LG940E,"I really wanted to love Cherry Switch. I'm a big fan of cherry-flavored sodas and I like Switch's blend of natural juices, vitamin C, and filtered water. On paper, this seemed like the perfect beverage for me. In reality, it tasted like I was drinking a vitamin. You ever have one of those cherry-flavored acerola tablets? That's what drinking Cherry Switch is like.<br /><br />By no means if the beverage offensive; it's just not particularly tasty. I'll give it credit for being a natural product that offers vitamin C, but I'm dinging it for the taste. Would I got out of my way to buy this drink? Absolutely not. Would I buy it as an impulse purchase if I saw it at a deli? Maybe...but chances are, something else would get my attention.<br /><br />On another positive note, my wife liked the beverage because of its low carbonation.

I have heard and read so many great things about sams yams that when I saw them on amazon I got 4 bags super excited. When I got them I opened them up and gave one to my very excited dog he loved it. But as my doggie is small only 18 lbs I decided to cut them in half so I emptied the treats on my kitchen table to find TWO LIVE MAGGOTS! I was so grossed out I quickly took the treat away from my doggie and opened another bag and the same thing MORE MAGGOTS! I'm so disappointed please do not buy this product! I have pictures !<br /><br />I called the company and left a message since it was after hours I never heard back. Needless to say I returned them to amazon.

B000E7YPPK,"There's nothing wrong with this packaged mix, but it's just approximately 8 ounces of rice noodle and an ounce of tamarind sauce;  you must provide all the other ingredients.<br /><br />Rice noodles are cheap, and the sauce is just tamarind paste, sugar, and soy sauce--you can keep a jar of tamarind paste in the fridge for months.  For what this costs, you can get pounds and pounds of rice noodle and several jars of tamarind paste.

B0041NYV8E,"I found this ginger-lemon tea to be so-so. Although I mixed the powder and water quite well, I found the taste inconsistent.  Some sips had an overpowering ginger taste.  Other times the flavor was more moderate and the lemon taste was reflected.  In the end, I found that this had too strong of an aftertaste, a sensation similar to that experienced with some artificial sweeteners.  If you like Gold-kilis other products, or if you like very strong ginger flavored drinks, this is for you.  If not, you may wish to try another product.",3
B001LXYA5Q,"After reading most of the reviews, I was expecting the tablet to taste gross.  It does not.  It's not yummy, but it does have a slight (tart?) flavor to it.<br /><br />My first taste was of a strawberry.  It was way too sweet for me.  Almost tasted like I had put tons of sugar on the strawberry, or even sugar substitute.  Next I tried a blackberry, blueberry, pomegranate seed....they were sweeter, but I wasn't blown away by how ""good"" they tasted, just surprised at how my taste buds have changed.  Next up, a lemon!  Everyone has been right about the lemon, it tastes like lemonade!  I ate half of a lemon before I decided it was too sweet for me.  I put pomegranate flavored Greek yogurt over the fruit I just mentioned, and had a bite.  TOO SWEET for me!  Next up, some fermented spicy daikon (ever hear of ""Dave's Gourmet Korean food""?  Everything is fermented in vinegar and it is DELICIOUS!).  The vinegar taste was gone, but the spiciness remained.  Interesting.  I actually like the regular flavor, unaltered, so I won't be having that again.  Oh, I also tried chocolate flavored coconut water--yuck!  There was a chocolate CHALKY taste to it.  It has now been 30 minutes and I just tried the other half of the lemon.  It still tastes sweet to me.  And then I had a sip of veggie broth (from ""Dave's Korean"") which is the only thing that has changed in a way that was pleasing to my taste buds.<br /><br />I'm giving the mberry four stars because it DOES do what it claims, it's just not my preferred way of tasting things.",4

With the WakeUp Call apparently disappearing I tried the Tree Hugger as a potential replacement and am very disappointed.  The coffee is not bad at all, it is just nothing like the other bold offerings from coffee people.  If you like mild, low acid coffee with a subtle flavor, this will probably float your boat.  If you like a strong cup of joe with a lot of flavor and character, or like to brew the 12oz setting, look for a stronger offering.",3

B001LG940E,"Disclaimer: This review is a result of Amazon's ""Vine Voice"" program, which means Amazon supplied me with a free can of Black Cherry Switch in exchange for this review.<br /><br />The Switch idea sounds pretty good.  Much of the world has been programmed to identify with carbonated beverages.  Instead of champagne or cola, ""Switch"" is fruit juice with ""natural flavors"" and ""filtered sparkling water"", with no additional syrups, sugar, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />If it were either much better tasting or much more nutritious or had much less calories than it's competition, Switch might be worth the buck a can price.  The taste isn't better than the local carbonated diet fruit-flavored drink that I can buy for $2 for 12.  If I throw in a vitamin C tablet or an orange into the daily diet, it's not more nutritious either.  The carbonation angle is only a plus for someone who thinks that a beverage can be a beverage if it's fizzie.<br /><br />The goal in the marketplace should be to make a better mousetrap or a less expensive one.  ""Switch"" fails both of these tests in my mind.",3

I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors, deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it, and we are now enjoying a strong, healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats, their energy levels are better, and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies, then get this very nice product.

B000F9Z1WI,"As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!",4
B007OXJK3Y,"I was hoping for a delicious cup of coffee that tasted rich and chocolatey...unfortunately, that was not the case with the Donut House Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut.  This was my first keurig k-cup purchase so I was new to the game and did not know about all the different ""bold"" and ""extra bold"" terms.  This k-cup provides (what I would call) a ""light"" cup of coffee, as opposed to a ""bold"" cup of coffee.  I tend to prefer the ""bold"" coffees, so this particular product was not for me.  If you like a ""light"" coffee, then you will like this product (although I do not think the chocolate flavor was very strongly noted at all).",2

B000WFRMRW,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.",4

B004BCV53O,"My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!",1

B000FK52B2,"I find the trays are good but the smaller seeds plug up the holes and slow down drainage. This defeats the purpose so I got the hemp/flax bags and start the smaller seeds in those and then after they sprout I transfer to the trays so they receive more light. They I can also drain quickly by tipping on side and holding the sprouts in. I also keep the trays in the fridge after they mature. They stack and breathe so they are very effective. I plan on buying the larger trays as well for greater farming capacity. Also more hemp bags. I also plan on trying the nut milk bags for sprouting. My only complaint on the hemp ones is they smell a little musty, like wet rope. I am going to try a little H2O2 on them to see if that lowers the smell. To their defense, the smell rinses right off and they work like a champ! I am going to get another batch of three as well. The bags work excellent for bean sprouts all the way to maturity.<br />If anyone has doubts about the power of sprouts, give them a try, they are the apple of my eye!<br />I am now a sprout convert and a farmer in my own house.<br /><br />Cheers to living foods!",4

We bought the Saeco because it was priced in our comfort level, and we assumed it was the closest to the Spydem that died.  The Saeco makes an OK cup of coffee, however for the money it is really stripped of features we were used to. For example -no dreg drawer warning, no empty water warning, even though the manual says its there. Also no energy saving mode. Single boiler, and of course a lot of plastic. It seems all these machines are quite expensive for some reason - probably largely because they're built in Italy. Hopefully someone in the far East will catch on to the money that could be made if they were to start building these machines, and we could all be paying $300 for them.<br /><br />Added 8/12/12 - we've had the machine for about 2 years now and it has been very disappointing.  Makes an OK cappuccino, but not hot enough.  In spite of being cleaned regularly it has been temperamental, stopping in mid cycle and freezing.

B001LG945O,"If you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at, e.g., office holiday parties (where alcohol is verboten), you'll probably like The Switch: It does have a nice, ""fruity"" taste (kind of a ""sharp"" orange -- perhaps the tangerine's influence, although probably more the apple juice), with a bit of a bite due to the carbonation.  If this were one of my options at, e.g., the Medusa-esque soda dispensers found at 7-11, I would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some.<br /><br />But an indulgence it is... and that's why I'm not planning on purchasing more from Amazon.  In particular:<br /><br />-- You're paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda.  Please.  I don't mind paying more for higher-quality goods, but at least make it a decent value for the money... make it 12oz.<br />-- Calorically it's not a great value, having around half-again as many calories per once as Coca Cola does.  If you're some teen who can eat whatever you want, this doesn't matter... but for those of us who aren't blessed with such metabolisms... well... the calories are better ""spent"" elsewhere.

B001EQ55RW,"I really like Emerald nuts, and have been buying their smoked almonds and cashews a while. These cocoa roast almonds preserve much of what I like about Emerald nuts - freshness, not too much oil, high quality - but are more of a semi-sweet snack instead of a salty one.<br /><br />Their sweetness doesn't come from sugar, though. They are sweetened lightly with sucralose (the sweetener sold under the brand name Splenda).<br /><br />Note that the product doesn't contain chocolate, though it's described as ""dark chocolate flavor"". The cocoa is roasted into the surface of the nut, but the almonds are not coated in chocolate. The good part about that is that they don't make a mess, and they're a better choice for someone who is trying to avoid sweets. But I'm sure some have bought these expecting to get chocolate and were disappointed.<br /><br />I liked them enough that I'll get them again, especially when I need something to cut the craving for chocolate candy.

B001LG940E,"The product itself was OK, and the description was exactly correct.<br /><br />The Switch ""Black Cherry"" flavor tastes like someone took a small amount of Libby 100% juice cherry cocktail, mixed half of it with white grape juice, then added carbonated water.  It was a little overly sweet for a soda that has no added sugar in it, had a very ""white grape"" or ""apple"" juice-filler taste to it, and was middling on the cherry flavor.  However, this is not intended to denigrate Libby's juice, because I would prefer just a regular uncarbonated juice over The Switch.<br /><br />In comparison with other higher-end sodas, the Switch tastes a lot like Izze but the flavors aren't quite as well-blended (Izze's Blackberry tastes a little like carbonated jell-o in a can, and The Switch is more of the same).  It is just as overly sweet taste of Jones' soda, so if you are a fan of either of the above, you might like this.  If you enjoy lighter-tasting sodas like Hint or Dry soda, you'll probably want to stay away from this particular soda, as it can be a bit overwhelming.  I would probably not purchase this product again. Although it was not much better or worse than Izze or Jones soda, it was still a bit too sweet for me.",3
B008O3G25W,"The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'.",2
B004GU3YXU,"I was very satisfied with my purchase of Nutiva hemp seeds. I ordered a 2-pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly. They taste great on their own, but I usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile, or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture. My supply is almost gone so I'll definitely be ordering more.<br /><br />One of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but I didn't find any in mine.",5
B0029NTQ1K,"My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms. Not so sure about the soft filling, because she swallows them whole. Ditto for tartar control. It doesn't do much for that . . . maybe would be different if my cat would chew them.",4
B002DLXXHG,I purchased this item based on the description that stated all natural ingredients and no nitrite. Once I got it I happily consumed it before finding out it did contain sodium nitrite.  As far as I am concerned Amazon should not be distributing wrongly advertised products like this. A big disappointment.,1
B002QWP89S,"I have a (now) 6 month old miniature daschund puppy. I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog. I'd definitely recommend these if you want your dog's breath freshened!",4

B002MXSAD2,I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.,4
B003ANFMY8,"My cat has been eating this for years, and it seems that the bag keeps getting smaller and the price (for a while) kept going up!  My cat has very sensitive stomach - so this does the trick.  I just hoped it contained more meat verses fillers!",4

B002MXSAD2,"These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7-month-old, one cube makes about 2-3 servings of food for her. I love that it has a cover, and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out. But, it's pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food, and the fewer slots make it harder to mass-produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays.",4
B003TIVBSU,"We were running out of vanilla. I'd made my own before using vanilla beans and vodka, and the price of these was far cheaper than getting them locally. I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I was thinking, but half a pound of vanilla beans works out to something like 50 of them. It's hard to picture 50 vanilla beans, but this would be a good order to go in halves on with someone. Or quarters.<br /><br />The aroma is incredible. It's been a couple of months since we originally opened them, and our pantry still smells like vanilla, even though they are wrapped in two ziploc bags.<br /><br />As for the vanilla itself, it is fantastic. If you've never tried vanilla produced yourself, you are absolutely missing out. There is a distinct and definite difference between homemade and what you buy at the store.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, hit ""add to cart"" and check out. You'll be glad you did.",5

B003Y3NOP8,"I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty enough- but there are tastier out there, like Plum.",1
B004X3VRLG,"I gave this chew to a labrador.  It was probably a little small for him as he was able to put the whole item into his mouth and choked on it once.  It took him approximately twenty minutes to consume the whole treat.<br /><br />The fun bites have a hard rawhide outside and a softer center.  I liked that it was not a messy product; there were only a few crumbs left behind.  It does not have a strong odor.<br /><br />Not sure about the ""digestive support"", the dog got the squirts later but he seems to have a sensitive stomach and that often happens when a new item is introduced into his diet.<br /><br />Update - 8/4/11 - The labrador mentioned was just diagnosed with a bad pancreas, so this product neither helped or hurt his issue. He is now on a special diet for his lifetime.",3

B0013NUGDE,"Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :(",1

Forget it. Directions followed to a T, but this stuff just isn't worth it. No one at the table liked this stuff. Another disappointing gluten free pasta; don't waste your money.",1

B002UL1K6K,"I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!",5
B005TY2REE,"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",4
B004867T24,"These are actual slices of tuna that can be either a treat or a meal for your cat or dog. As others have mentioned, I too had trouble getting the package open. You are supposed to tear off the top and then open a resealable zip closure. But by the time I got to the tuna, the zip was ruined, so it became a meal for my cats. The tuna was easy to handle and broke up into smaller bite-sized bit without any effort. It also was not as ""fishy"" in smell as you might expect.<br /><br />Did my cats like it? Of Yeah! But the problem is price. $9.99 for a 4 ounce package? You can get 12 Chicken of the Sea 2.5 ounce tuna packages here on Amazon.com for $15.54 and this is tuna you can eat too!<br /><br />If it had a better price point and was easier to open, I would give it a better score.

B001E5E056,"This cereal is very misleading: the box claims to have blueberry clusters (photo shows abundant clusters) but contains at most two or three clusters PER BOWL, maybe 15 clusters PER BOX. As someone who rarely reviews anything, the extreme lack of blueberries and apparent false advertising was so laughable that I felt the need to find reviews on the Internet to see how others received it. I find it very surprising that there are so many positive reviews... Is the lack of blueberries a new thing? Perhaps the economic meltdown has led to Kashi grossly cutting back on including dried fruit in their products? I think the answer is yes. That, or maybe we should just all stop making the silly assumption that a cereal that claims to have ""oat flakes & blueberry clusters"" actually has blueberry clusters.",1

B000TRFGGM,"I received this item today and while it is indeed a Venus Fly Trap in a 3"" pot, I was disappointed to find it is the kind of plant that comes in the clear plastic packaging that is available at a few department stores and garden centers in my area. I specifically ordered a plant on the internet to avoid getting one of these.<br /><br />I still give 4 stars because it did arrive in pretty good shape, and most of the plants like this in stores are not very healthy. And, after all, I ordered a flytrap in a 3"" pot and that's what I got.

I carefully opened the package on arrival so I know I didn't do it. I'm not going to bother returning because it's not worth the hassle.<br /><br />Other than that, this stuff tastes very good, and even after losing one bag out of three, it's still a very good price for the quality.

I'd like to think I know a thing or two about hot sauces. Tabasco, Crystal, and many other hot sauces that have had heart and soul put into them have made their way onto my plate. But man........Dexter hit the money on this one. This sauce is truly amazing, for lack of better words. You get a burst of flavor when you first bite into your dish covered in Bandito, then a nice after rush of spice hits the tongue for a great ending. I really haven't found a dish that it doesn't go good on.<br /><br />I was skeptic at first, as I knew going in that I was only buying it because I was a fan of The Offspring.

Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.

B0010VO7HA,"This beef stroganoff mix is not bad--just bland, not a particularly tasty use of a pound of ground beef and a container of fresh mushrooms.  I thought it was worth trying because it's cheap and it's available in my local grocery stores. The stroganoff mix I'm comparing it to, Annie's Homegrown Organic, is less convenient for me; I have to order in bulk from Amazon or stock up when out of town.  And the Annie's mix is a bit more than twice as expensive.  Whether a box meal is organic isn't important to me, so I'm not taking that into account.

It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn't taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more ""orangey,"" but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice ""filler"").  Despite having ""no added sugar,"" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.

It creates a very stable platform.<br />The trees are absoulutely gorgeous!!!!<br />They look very close to the pics they show here.<br />Since they are hand made, each will look slightly different, but nothing that detracts from their overall beauty.<br />By the way, Bonsai-Boy does not manufacture these.<br />They are jobbed out to artisans in other parts of the country, hence the wait of at least 14 days to get your item(s.<br />They are truly works of art and I'd recomend these to anyone who has a love of these trees, but like me, does not have a green thumb.<br />The communicaton with Bonsai-boy is good and they endevor to answer any question you have.<br />Did I mention how beautiful these are? LOL!",5
B003KLSZGW,I like these crackers so much I just ordered a different flavor.  These are very crunchy and satisfying.  I put two crackers into a zip lock baggie.  Break them into bite sized pieces and this is my treat throughout the day and into the evening and they are very filling.  I do recommend them however I don't know how well they'd go over for those with dentures.  Because they are so crisp and because they have seeds of various sizes.  Very good find.  Love um.,5
B000OIWY8Y,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!!<br />Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more.<br />And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM!<br />smiles, grace in VT",5
B002DLXXHG,I'm not picky at all when it comes to food but this beef jerky was some of the blandest jerky I've ever had. Not much flavor at all. I got the Teriyaki flavored. Maybe other flavors are better.,2

B000FK63IS,"Before being GF, my main pastas were DiCecco, a common imported brand which cooks up authentically al dente, and Barilla, which in American comes from the mid-west (not as good as the real-Italian Barilla that we don't import).  Tinkyada pasta has a pretty strong brown rice tase and a slightly off aftertaste.  The texture is a little slippery, and it disintegrates a bit while cooking.  It's still pretty good if you serve it with a sauce that you would put on a plate of brown rice, i.e., a sauce with its own texture and assertive flavor.  It's not as good if the pasta is the star of the dish.  Of the brands I've tried, Jovial is by far the best.  The brown rice taste is minimal, even nice, and it cooks more al dente than the regular wheat American brands.",3
B0093A5XC8,"So frothed up on its own (no additions) it was quite spicy. Well, not spicy hot but tasted a lot like spices! The pumpkin was definitely in the smell though, so I knew it was a pumpkin tea and not just a spice tea!<br /><br />Of course, what's a pumpkin pie matcha without a latte? This is where the tea did SHINE! I frothed up the matcha with a bit of brown sugar then added about Â¼ cup warm water. I then heated up the rest of my Vanilla Almond milk, added it and topped the cup with a healthy helping of whipped cream - oh mama! The brown sugar brought out the sweet pumpkin flavour - I could even taste a bit of crust! I love when that happens.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this tea as a hot latte on a crisp fall day in your cutest flannel and plaid scarf. You can add in some friends to share, or be like me and keep it all to yourself.",4
B001II47PW,"I guess I expected too much of this product.  I wanted a salt that actually had the taste of bacon.  Try as I could, it was very difficult to discern.  I did not like the ""garlicy"" after-taste either.  Don't remember ever eating bacon that had the taste of garlic.  If this were re-manufactured as a smokey rub, it might make the grade.",2
B005CUU25G,"I am only reviewing the bacon flavor (was supposed to get 3 different flavors, but only got one).<br /><br />The good news is that my dog went crazy over this.  He absolutely loved it!  I have literally never seen him get this excited about a treat.  Unfortunately, that is also the bad news.  Because he loved it so much, and because he got so excited, it was a pointless exercise trying to get him to just lick the top.  He would take a lick or two, then he would start hopping and jumping, and trying to grab the entire bottle out of my hand.<br /><br />I have 11 and 10 year old daughters, and they normally love giving the dog a treat.  They won't give him this anymore, because it gets the dog hyper excited, and he starts jumping on them trying to get the treat out of their hands.<br /><br />So......whatever the ingredient inside the bottle is, my dog loves it, and I suppose yours will too.  The only question is the delivery system.  Maybe its not the best idea to have a treat that is meant to be held like this one is.  It assumes that your dog will sit quietly while you hold the bottle and he licks the top. No way that will ever happen with my dog.  He looks at it as he does any treat....he thinks it is meant to be taken and eaten.<br /><br />I debated on giving the product a 3 (because I don't think I will ever buy it for the reasons noted above) or a 4 (because my dog loves the flavor).  Ultimately I gave it a 4.  If my dog loves it, how could I give it a 3.<br /><br />**Update 10-5-11**Despite the fact that my dog loves the taste of this thing, I took it down to a 3 star rating.  Nothing really has changed, except for the fact that I am finding this to be more of a pain than I originally thought.  It was a novelty at first, but now I am weary of fighting the dog over this thing and trying to keep him from biting and chewing it (and creating a choking hazard or a mess).  Can't recommend it.<br /><br />**Update 10-9-11**I feel foolish writing another update on this product, but this is my last one.  My dog has gotten the hang of using this product, and now does a pretty good job of licking versusing chewing.  Also, this is one of his favorite treats. I am surprised, because my dog loves to chew, so I would have thought that a licking treat wouldn't hold much interest for him.  I am now thinking I would buy this product again ***but*** not at an $8 price point.  Way too expensive, relative to what you get.  The package says you get 500 licks.  In about 30 seconds, my dog get in 10-15 licks.  He does this twice a day, so this thing is not going to last 3 weeks at my house.  For me to buy this, it would have to be in the $2-3  price range.  I have to imagine that if they can sell deoderant in this price range (and this thing is identical to roller ball deoderant), then they can sell liquid dog treats in this price range.",3

B007POT6RM,"Quaker's Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal is adequate oatmeal and should appeal to you if you like your oatmeal sweeter than average.  For you - 4 stars.  For everybody else - 3.<br /><br />I've been eating oatmeal almost every breakfast for 11 years.  Over that time I've gradually used less and less sweetener.  So the sweetness of M&BS is a little much for me - however the maple flavor and smell is strong and pleasant and that goes a long way towards making up for it.<br /><br />Preparation is easy enough.  Add water, nuke it for 90 seconds, done.  Regular oatmeal isn't much harder but these packets are handy if you're going to eat in the office or on the road.",4

B001BDDTB2,"I tried these out with my cat in the hopes of finding something she would like!  She tends to not like canned food very much.  I was truly surprised when she showed immediate interest in the snapper variety and then actually ate the whole can.  She was not very fond of the yellowfin--she nibbled a bit and then wanted dry food.  I am thrilled to finally have found something she likes.  She will eat thr tuna, but not with the enthusiasm she has for the snapper. I also like the smaller portion size--no more covering cans and keeping them in the fridge--only to have to warm them up for the next meal.  Definitely try these out.",4
B001EQ55RW,"If you get this expecting dry roasted almonds--emphasis on dry, crunchy--rather than regular almonds, it is a fine snack in a casual group.

One didn't like them at all, but the others gave them either 4 or 5 stars--particularly enjoying the smallness, crispness and lack of sweetness.  I probably wouldn't get them again for myself, but defnitely could put a bowl out for guests, as a casual alternative to greasier and sweeter snack foods.",3

B004ZIER34,"Puroast is mean to be a low-acid alternative to regular coffees. The Low Acid French Roast packet made a nice strong pot of coffee. The flavor is above average for a ground coffee. Most noticeable is a smooth finish with minimal aftertaste. This would especially make a nice evening cup of coffee, or go well when served with or after meals that are more likely to bother your stomach. It is certainly a product I will consider using again. A good idea, and if you're one who is bothered by the acidity of coffee, this innovation will certainly be welcome. And though I don't have the means or motivation to test their low-acid claims, Forbes.com published an article backing up their claims both to low acid content and significantly reduced symptoms for those normally effected by coffee. So I'd say this is a product with good flavor that warrants checking out.",4
B000EVT04M,"I guess the most appealing thing about this confection is the price: you get a lot candy for your dollar.<br /><br />The ""gummi""ness is on the hard side much more than the soft.

It does have a vaguely dish-soap-like aftertaste, though, that I could really do without.<br /><br />All-in-all, So, the best part about this stuff is the value.

B000N4TR9S,"Where should I start?? The one truly good thing I can say is that I've been a customer of Amazon for several years, and as always their shipping was prompt and accurate, I do not in any way hold Amazon accountable for my dissatisfaction with this product. That being said, I ordered this for my parents to give as a gift to someone else. When it arrived, I was appalled!! First of all, this being the HOLIDAY season, I was shocked that this was wrapped with a light green and gold bow with BLACK ribbon, looking more like a Halloween or fall gift! Even worse was the fact that the keepsake box looked NOTHING like what was advertised. You can see that it is supposed to be a cream colored leather box, but that is not what arrived....what arrived was a black and gray fabric box with a black leather lid, and very cheaply made. There is no covering (material or otherwise on the inside) just green cardboard, and the same for the bottom. After taking inventory of the items listed to be in the box, yes, they were all there.<br /><br />Perhaps worse than the quality of the box, the wrapping, and the fact that the keepsake box is not as advertised is what occurred when I called customer service at Art of Appreciation. I politely explained that I was unhappy with the box, and that it was nothing like the picture. The customer service lady stated that sometimes they had to substitute if they ran out. (Note that nowhere does it say in the description: subject to change). Upon giving her my order number, she said she could not help me because that was Amazon's number, so I would have to deal with them.....(really??? it's still their product???) I pointed out that they had the same picture on their own site, and asked if I ordered another of the same item but through THEM, what kind of box would I receive?  She said she would check with her manager, and came back with a description of the same piece of junk I had received. I said I strongly suggest they change their picture, because I am sure they will have a lot of displeased customers. Her response was to tell me they ""hadn't had time"".....really?? I know of it being advertised at least 3 weeks this way, and there hasn't been time to change the pic?? Needless to say, the response about the ribbon was useless, with the response being: I understand, I wouldn't be happy with those colors either. (Gee, thanks!) There was no attempt to please me as a customer whatsoever, not even a cursory apology, I was simply told several times that she couldn't help me because Amazon bought the product from them.....not satisfactory to me, since it is their product with their name on it, and obviously came shrink-wrapped by them! Finally, I found it completely laughable (and actually had to bite my tongue) when her reasoning for not being able to help me was that due to the order number belonging to Amazon and not Art of Appreciation, she couldn't help me BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE MY NAME OR ADDRESS!!! I had to bite my tongue to not respond: get a pen and paper if it's not too much trouble, because I'm fairly certain that ""I"" CAN GIVE YOU MY NAME AND ADDRESS....the only reason I did not, was because it was very apparent that she was not willing to help. At this time it has been over two days since that phone call, as you can see for yourself.....they are STILL advertising an INCORRECT PICTURE.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I did not contact Amazon to return this was because my parents did not have the desire to fool around with shipping it back and shopping for another gift. However I am quite certain that if I had, Amazon would have been much more helpful to deal with.",2

I've tried most major brands of coffee, from the makers of specialty coffee such as Starbucks and Peets to makers of commercial-grade coffee such as Folgers, Maxwell House, and Yuban.<br /><br />I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. It definitely ranks as one of the best coffee I've ever tasted. It is medium-bodied yet rich, aromatic, and robust. I usually associate a darker gourmet coffee with flavor, but Melitta has changed that perception. It is not bitter and very smooth to the palate.<br /><br />I generally prefer a darker, more full-bodied coffee such as Peet's, so I was surprised that I enjoyed Melitta a fair bit. While it doesn't displace Peet's as my favorite coffee, it offers a very nice departure from a full-bodied coffee without compromising on flavor. Another plus for me is the Melitta packs quite a punch in caffeine!<br /><br />---<br />If you like a coffee with a lighter body, you will enjoy the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. If you're accustomed to a darker coffee, the Melitta may or may not be suited to your taste. (You won't know it until you try it!)

B000PDY3P0,"I had wanted to try this popcorn for a long time, finally treated myself to some. It is pretty good, but I add a dollop of butter and a small amount of popcorn salt to the pan before it pops. I probably won't buy it again because I can make better popcorn from scratch myself.",4
B001AJ1ULS,"Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much.",4
B007POT6RM,"Like most instant oatmeal, this ended up being a lot like baby cereal in texture and way too thin if you don't cut back on the amount of water called for.  One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture.",2
B000OV5NB6,I put this product in my coffee & it tastes fantastic! Coffee is kindof boring without it. Excellent product & super good for you!,5
B001CD1VI4,"Sue, I think you got a bad batch, these are awesome! I have ordered them three times now and each time they have been soft, tasty, and easily slide out of the bags. I sincerely think you got a bum pack. I have tried a couple of other flavors too but prefer this one over the others. The cookies are healthy and fast and most of all, taste great.",5
B003C5THEK,This item is made in China.  It is not safe for your dog.  Please do not use.  I am currently trying to find an American Made chicken jerky!,1

B002JWZVWO,"Just to give this drink a good chance, I stuck it in the fridge for a couple of days, shook it really well, and tried it straight, without ice.  The color was okay, the consistency was okay, not much of a smell.<br /><br />Then I tasted it, and the first thing that came to mind was, it's salty.  I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a ""Coconut Water"".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.<br /><br />I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.<br /><br />Overall, Not crazy about it.<br /><br />Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.  But at least the container's mostly paper and potentially better for the environment?",2
B005HO0ARM,Very pleased this stuff smells so good. My roommies LOVE to sniff the shower after ive been in there. the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery. So it gets 5 stars from me.,5
B00452GWZ6,"You have to get use to eating nothing :) this is what this is like.<br />They smell and taste like the ocean, I like the sesame seed much better.<br />While I was at Whole Foods yesterday,these were 3 for $5.00<br />I bought 15pks.they don't spoil. I mix them with nuts, yummmm.",4
B000FKQDAQ,I love the lifesaver's sugar free wintergreen bags but I didnt like the taste of these.  Its not the lack of sugar since I knew that when buying them -- its the synthentic flavors. Orange is basically baby-aspirin taste.  Pineapple flavor isnt so bad. I'll stick with the wintergreen from now on.,2

B0000CEPDP,"Like others, I found my cats initially interested, but they quickly (a couple of tries) decided that Hi-Tor Neo wasn't for them. For my two kitties with late-stage renal failure, I am working my way through some other commercial cat food options that don't advertise themselves as renal diets, but that have phosphorus and protein levels comparable to those of Neo-tor (which is a little higher than prescription renal diets). There is very valuable updated diet information available at [...] if you are looking for information on the protein and phosphorus content of cat foods (The site provides breakdowns for both canned and dry cat foods). I have found that they prefer the Organix flavors listed there, which have comparably low protein and even lower phosphorus. It is a little more expensive, but you can buy it by the can at local stores to try it-- I've never seen Hi-Tor Neo in a store.",3
B0030VBRIU,Very surprised.  Expected it to be thicker.  My 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there.  I would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here.,1
B001AJ1ULS,"I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, ""Made in China"".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />Do NOT trust this product!!!",1
B001I4H6H2,"This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.",1
B001EQ5L0I,"Form: bottle-cap size pressed cakes, dark color.  Opens to medium-sized leaves.  Looks to be at least somewhat tippy.  Could be wrong about that, though.<br />Color: Dark as coffee, but with a more reddish tone.  Quite pretty actually.<br />Smell: smoke and some faint sweetness.<br />Tate: Very assertive. Dry hay dust. Wet mulch. Smoke. Long-lingering smokey/woody after-taste.<br /><br />I bought this because I wanted something ""earthy"" and bold, and boy did I get it in spades!  It's pleasant enough and a nice change of pace from my normal Ceylon routine.  I don't know how well it rates within the black pu-erh family, but my uneducated opinion is that I'm not sure I could see myself drinking this every day.  The woody aspect is overwhelming at times.  Maybe a couple times a month when I'm in the mood for something a lil' ""dirty.""  If you are on the fence, I say give it a shot!",3
B0026KR08M,"While I agree that these nuts are quite tasty, the total weight of the eight packs is one pound. Thats $26.00 per pound for cashews! I can buy fresh-roasted spiced cashews at the local gourmet nut shop for half that and see them roasted right in front of me!",1

We're on WIC in our state, and this formula is the only lactose free, non soy based formula covered. She got Baby's Only Lactose Free formula, which she loved. However, it's not covered on WIC. We have tried to move her over to Nutramigen, but she blankly refuses to drink it. If nothing else, what little she did drink, didn't upset her stomach like regular Enfamil, hence the 2 stars rather than 1.",2

B007I7Z3Z0,"I tried this Strawberry Acai Decaf Green Tea Mix along with my two daughters ages 10 & 12. My 10 year old didn't care for it, on the other hand, my 12 year old liked it and said it tastes like liquid strawberry jello. A serving size is 1/2 a packet and 8 oz of water, only 5 calories, and 1 gram of sugar. It is sweetened with honey and also sucralose. It is perfect for the 16.9 oz water bottles which would be double the serving if you are counting calories but still only 10 calories and 2 g of sugar. It does say it's Decaf Iced Green Tea, strawberry acai flavored. I don't taste any iced tea at all, if you like strawberry flavored drinks then you'd probably like it, because strawberry is definitely the only flavor you taste. It's great drink for kids being so low calorie and so low in sugar as compared to the usual juices for kids and the packets are also very easy to open. I only gave it 3 stars because for me it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for, I wanted to be able to taste the iced tea. I would try a different flavor or maybe just the plain iced tea.",3
B0090X8IPM,"I really thought this would be delicious.  Starbucks coffee usually tastes great and I love vanilla flavored anything.  First off, when opening the bag I didn't smell vanilla.  At all.  The coffee grounds were large and uneven looking.  Sort of odd to me.  I brewed a pot, still no vanilla smell, and there was no vanilla taste at all.  There was some sort of odd, bitter taste, almost as if the coffee was old or something.  Hard to describe, but it was kind of musty tasting! I tried two more pots just to be sure before I gave up on this.  I even gave my coffee maker a good cleaning, but it was the coffee itself, not the maker.  I ended up throwing the rest of the bag away.  Very disappointing.",2

B000FIP7XW,Received my anise treats quickly.  The first batch was so smash into tiny pieces I returned them.  Another case was sent quickly.  They arrived promptly but also 4-5 of the cookies in each batch were broken into several pieces.  They tasted great so I ate them anyways!,3
B003ANFMY8,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

B000FA38ZY,"I have to say I was disappointed with this sample. The cookies were not a pleasing dark chocolate color as one might expect. The chocolate coating was a pale washed out brown color as if they had been subjected to extremes of temperature. The cookie part of the Mallomars was very dry and had started crumbling before I even opened the cellophane package. I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing. The outer packaging arrived in good shape so I do not think the problem was with the mailing. These were not the Mallomars I recalled enjoying from my youth. Based on this sampling, I certainly could not recommend these cookies.",2
B001EQ4RWQ,"I *really* don't like saying negative things about ANYthing, let alone products made by a mfr that's been around for a long time- like Hershey's.  But, I honestly must say I have found this product virtually unusable.<br /><br />I work for a company where some of the folks add chocolate squirts to their coffee.  So, we go thru a fair amt of chocolate syrup- and thus I have purchased, over 6-9 months, about 3 of the 6-bottle cases of this.  Regrettably, each has been the same- i.e. I'm not just judging the product based on one possibly bad case, or batch.<br /><br />I *do* get a sense of chocolate from this-  !!BUT!! the accompanying odd taste- and the persistent aftertaste, is quite bad.  I've literally mixed this with milk- which has been GOOD milk, and several times not been able to force myself to drink the whole glass- I've had to pour it out- the non-chocolate odd chemical taste of the syrup- EVEN when mixed with milk- was THAT bad.<br /><br />Apparently if you only use a little bit- like maybe a small shot in a cup of coffee- you MIGHT not notice anything different.  But, if you try to taste this directly, or mix it with a reasonably lightly flavored substance- like milk, or water, or, perhaps, cake or cookie mix, I can virtually *guarantee* it will not taste the same to you- it has a VERY odd chemical, sour, bitter, or SOMEthing taste, IMO.<br /><br />Perhaps, if this is the ONLY type of syrup you can use, due to diabetes requirements, or something, you might try it.  However, I would strongly recommend that you look through & try OTHER products first- and use this particular ""sugar-free"" one as a last resort.  Or, if you're determined to try it, go out & find a single bottle in your local store- and try that.  Then, if you *still* like it, perhaps go ahead and buy a case.<br /><br />However, apart from a very special need, I can't imagine why someone would use this.<br /><br />I do *not* think, for example, that even an average person who's concerned about calories, would use THIS.  In fact, *I* am concerned about calories- which is why I tried using this, and stuck with it for so long.  I almost *always* use the low-calorie varieties of foods.  And, in ten-plus years, I have rarely found any problems in doing that- I'm a pretty tolerant person, taste-wise.<br /><br />However, this is one product that I simply can NOT force myself to use anymore- I'm shifting to Hershey's ""low-fat"" version of the syrup.<br /><br />This is DEFINITELY not the product for me- AND, looking at other reviews, it looks like I'm not the ONLY one who thinks this has a VERY unusual side-taste & aftertaste.",1
B002IEZJMA,"It's not bad.  I had this on my way into work.  Great way to get some caffiene in ya before work!  It only has 4 ingredients: Coffee, sugar, and the other two I assume are preservatives or something.  It tasted almost creamy, although there is no cream in it!  It was sweeter - more sweet than anything else.  The coffee flavor is on the watery side.  It tasted like one of those cold Starbucks drinks you can buy, only not as creamy.  I thought it was good enough - but I'd never buy them.  My preference for a cold coffee-style drink is those excellent Starbucks bottle things!!!",3

It is a great toy and it definitely keeps his attention.  The one I have has an actual rope and not a rubber rope, so it has lasted. He has managed to chew off a few of the spikes on the rubber ball.

My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent. I'm not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me.

Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.<br /><br />I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.<br /><br />I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill<br />gluten free bread (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's bread mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.<br /><br />Hope it help,",1

First off, it seemed rather syrupy, but then I realized that's just because the sweetness factor is, apparently, set to eleven.

It made me want to reach for insulin, though I don't take any.<br /><br />I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who don't have well-developed palettes, but if you're past the age of, say, nine, this probably isn't the drink for you.",2

This comes in a neat, tidy package and doesn't need refrigeration, but the problem is that it's been hydrogenated in order to have a nice, firm, even consistency, and hydrogenation can't help but add some trans-fats -- something nobody should be eating at all (barring a few found naturally in fat from ruminant animals, which are very different in structure from those found in hydrogenated fats, and seem to be beneficial to eat).<br /><br />I suspect that the levels of trans-fats here aren't way high -- the hydrogenation is probably just enough to make a firm, consistent product -- but I'd rather avoid them entirely.",1

B008O3G25W,"My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats.",3

In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy.

Get double duty if you would rather smell chemicals for 5 minutes than poop all day.<br /><br />This litter also has the tendency to stick to paws. If you get it, keep the box on a non-carpet surface so you can easily sweep the granules that your cat may track out.<br /><br />Overall, good product, just be prepared for a nasty smell for 5 minutes when your cat takes a dump.",4

B004CLCEDE,"It's not entirely obvious from the photos here on Amazon but these 7 ounce packages aren't like normal pasta, they're basically ""precooked"" noodles that are in bags filled with water so the actual quantity of noodles is maybe a small scoop per pricey bag. The noodles themselves have a texture that's (naturally) better suited to asian style noodle dishes (i.e. a ramen bowl) and upon initially opening the package there is definitely a vaguely fish-like scent-it's not a horrible pungent scent but more reminiscent of noodles just cooked in fish soup (really hard to describe to be honest). Thankfully this does go away nicely after rinsing and blanching per the instructions, and even when eaten with just red pasta sauce there weren't any weird flavors but the textures just didn't really feel at home here.<br />Honestly these noodles would feel most at home in making a low carb ramen noodle bowl or something similar, but the real reason I'm not going to buy these again is simply that the price is insane for the quantity you get.",3

Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be ""Pasteurized"", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a ""light"" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet.

B004B607MU,"I switched to mate from coffee a few years ago. I know it's generally an afternoon drink, but I drink it in the morning like coffee. There were a couple of websites where I bought it regularly. Unfortunately, Dr. Oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea, and the price went up everywhere, including my regular sellers. So I went looking, and found this on amazon.<br /><br />This is my favorite brand. The Selecci&oacute;n Especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in. This is ""elaborada con palo"", meaning that it has stem bits in it, which makes the flavor last longer for more refills. Some will prefer ""sin palo""(without stems), because the stems also add a little bitterness to the mate.<br /><br />I understand that in Argentina, where mate is a common as coffee is here, Rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brands.<br /><br />Of this seller in particular, I can say that they were prompt, and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate. A lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds, especially either ""citron"" which is lemon, or ""hierbes de monta&ntilde;a"", which means moutain herbs and tastes like mint.<br /><br />I, however, prefer this for day-to-day consumption. I run plain water through the coffee-maker, fill a large coffee cup about 1/3 full with mate, and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as I sip it through the bombilla.<br /><br />The main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what I had been getting from my previous suppliers. The difference is probably about handling and storage. The bags are like a bag of sugar, and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside, creating dust. In the mate, dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue, tastes a little bitter, and generally degrades the experience.<br /><br />When it first arrived, I opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that I use to store it. And I immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what I had been getting when I ordered this from my old seller.<br /><br />I'm very happy with what I received.",5

B008749N8Q,"I have severe diet restrictions.  All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.

B000KND8RY,"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.",1

But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense.

B000084E6V,"I have a Boston Terrier, who likes to chew, but won't just chew on anything.  After a bad experience with a tennis ball (that he got hold to) and his intestinal tract, I've been very selective about the toys I give him. A lot of the other pet owners that reviewed here had pets on the upper end of that 50lb scale and my Boston (at adult development) is only around 20lbs, if that. So, I thought I'd give this a try and watch out for complete destruction of the toy. Well, from day 1 when we received this he took to it immediately. I don't know if this has a flavor, but he didn't touch any of the other toys we received the same day... only this one. And, he's chewed on it every day now for about 4 months.  Only recently did I begin to notice that he'd finally broken through a corner and I tossed the toy. That white plastic can kill his intestinal organs if it gets in there.  So, for the price vs. the length of time it lasted and he enjoyed it without cause, it's an ""ok"" toy. I'm going to buy him another one, but I think the key is to stay vigilant and be sure that once your pet seems to start puncturing through this, it needs to be thrown out immediately. Since he is quite literally never alone, this is not as big an issue as it may be for other pet owners.  Please keep this in mind before buying!",3
B002PO09MS,"This fondant tastes good but does not work well for decorating cupcakes. It's very soft and the more you mix in color, the softer it becomes. I added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat, cookie cutters and tools, but it was a constant battle. My major complaint with this fondant is that it doesn't harden. I made decorations 3 days in advance (which I've done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they weren't drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi-dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, I'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time.

They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isn't very happy with them. She'll snack on them if that's her only option and she's really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and she's had the same reaction to them every time since then.",3

B000ER6YO0,I didn't eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.,4

B001LG940E,"This flavor wasn't as sweet as the strawberry kiwi version, but it didn't really taste that unique either.<br /><br />It almost tasted like a really light version of chery coke, but without the coke taste. Or a cherry flavored carbonated water, except it wasn't as sweet.<br /><br />My 4 year old took a couple of sips and didn't care too much for the product because of the bland taste. The carbonate is a little overpowering and all you get is a chery after taste. Once the carbs go flat, the cherry taste is very bland.<br /><br />At the moment, I do not recommend this product. I'd prefer drinking a cherry flavored carbonated water because it would quench my thirst and taste more.",3

B002LMUVJ0,"Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!",1
B004YV80O4,"This evening we had <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80O4"">Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> for dinner.  We were excited about trying this because my husband loves Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni and wanted to see if this was better. Twenty minutes is the total prep time, and all you need to prepare this dinner is two cups of water.<br /><br />My family had mixed reactions to the prepared meal:<br /><br />Dad: Wasn't what he expected - He thought that it would have a thick, Velveeta-type sauce.  The sauce tasted very cheesy, but was thin and kind of watery. Still it tastes better than the previous favorite.  We have a new winner!  Oh yes, there is no way that this is five servings.  It is one Dad-at-home-alone dinner, or all three family members having a meal with a salad on the side.<br /><br />Mom: It really is more like three servings than five, maybe even two servings if Dad is hungry.  It doesn't matter though, because of the over 1,400 mg of sodium per our family sized portion (850 mg per serving as the box calls a serving x 5 servings = 4,250 mg/3 people in our family = 1,417 mg. per serving)  Due to health issues, I can't eat that much salt, and I'd prefer that the rest of the family limit their salt as well.  I might be outvoted though.<br /><br />Kid: (with teeny appetite)  I tasted mustard, so I won't eat this.<br /><br />As it turns out, the dinner does contain a minute amount of mustard, so if you have mustard-hating kids, beware.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, and hope this gives you the info you need to decide if Kraft Velveeta Dinner is for you.",3

I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic.

B004XG2H6W,"Lemonade is a summer staple: Tasty, cold, refreshing ... and made with LOTS of sugar. This product is sweetened with Stevia, a natural but low calorie sweetener which to me, tastes a bit like saccharine, including the aftertaste.<br /><br />When you mix this powder with 16 ounces of cold water, you are not going to mistake the result for actual lemonade. It is much weaker, and has the stevia flavor. However, its not bad either, and the calorie savings makes it a serious alternative when you have a lemonade craving. We find that if we add a few drops of RealLemon juice to the mixture, it blunts the stevia taste somewhat. We'll be drinking a lot of this throughout the summer.",4

Well, he chews through it in a couple of minutes, and pretty much once he gets a tear in it, the entire thing comes off and he chews and swallows nearly the whole thing at once.  Needless to say, after a cost of 75cents or so per treat, it really wasn't worth 2 minutes of distraction, plus I wasn't happy with how he could swallow it nearly whole.  This would probably be better for smaller dogs or ones that aren't so food motivated!",2

True, it is sweet, and I must admit serves a purpose of sorts, but as for tasting anything like honey - no, it definitely does NOT.

B000M36L9E,"BAAR Cola Syrup at least TASTES good. I agree with my fellow reviewers who say it tastes good. It's exactly like coca-cola in flavour, except that it's not quite as sweet.  (And thus, doesn't even approach Pepsi-Cola in intensity of sweetness.)  No matter -- I just add a few packets of my own favourite artificial sweetener....<br /><br />This syrup, however, lists ""High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Sucrose"" as its first ingredient.  Sucrose is another word for sugar....bad enough, but at least it's been used for thousands and thousands of years, and most people, throughout history, who have imbibed sucrose/sugar, have lead relatively normal,(and normal-length), lives.  But High Fructose Corn Syrup, though also natural, is a somewhat modern invention.  Thus, the claim above the name, ""Cola Syrup"", right in the middle of the front of the label, (that this is an ""Old Fashioned Remedy"") is patently false.<br />(H.F. Corn Syrup was first -- unsuccessfully -- produced in 1957, and then sucessfully mass-produced and introduced into foods in 1975.)  Even if you are born in 2010, anything that has been around in foods for only 35 years, (since 1975), can hardly be called ""old-fashioned""!  Also, the listing of TWO ingredients, (""High-Fructose Corn Syrup AND / OR Sucrose""), as the possible number one, (largest amount) ingredient, is misleading, confusing, and (almost?) a violation of the law which mandates ingredients in food be listed in descending order of their amounts.  Are these ""And/Or"" ingredients listed alphabetically?  In order of how many bottles have HFCS, and how many have sucrose?  And how does one know, (if one is not a celebrity and is possibly being given the bottle for advertisement purposes), if the bottle one has purchased have the HFCS or the Sucrose?<br /><br />It is also totally astonishing to me that, according to the bottle, this product's manufacturer, BAAR, is the official supplier of Edgar Cayce Products!  The insignia of ""Cayce Care"" is, indeed, on this label!  And although the insignia is quite pretty, (a gold-outlined, white, horizontal oval, with a pretty little maple-leaf between the words ""Cayce"" and ""Care""), I simply<br />CANNOT believe that those who presently run the ""Edgar Cayce Foundation"" would ever condone the use of high-fructose corn syrup<br />in any of their products!  (Edgar Cayce himself probably never<br />heard of H.F.C.S, as he himself died in 1945.  Of course, Mr. Cayce is justly famous for his predictions of the future, (which he found whilst sleeping) -- but I am quite certain, (after reading up on H.F.C.S., on Wikipedia and elsewhere), that if Mr.<br />Cayce ever DID dream of H.F.C.S., he probably put it in the ""nightmare"" classification, and tried to forget all about it as much, and as soon, as possible!  In his place, I know that's what I would have done!)  To find high-fructose corn syrup in an Edgar Cayce Product is totally beyond belief. For myself, I will continue to admire, and research the modest, but completely genuine and gifted genuis who was Edgar Cayce -- but I will get my cola syrup elsewhere!<br /><br />And, where elsewhere?  From SodaSteam Soda Mix!  Slightly more expensive than this ""Baar"" Cola Syrup, it gives one: 1) A much, much thicker syrup, but the same 16 ounce size  2) Sweetening with SPLENDA.  Many people are down on Splenda, but it has been cited as the safest of the artificial sweeteners by David Zinczenko, of the ""Eat This -- Not That"" series of books.  Too much of anything is not good, of course, (I found that using too much Splenda gave me, personally, elevated readings on my liver tests....so I cut down) -- but from all I've read, Splenda is better than High-Fructose Corn Syrup, by a couple of miles!<br /><br />So, it's SodaStream Soda Mix Cola flavour for me.  If I find a healthier alternative than that, I will switch, (and hopefully be able to share my discoveries in an Amazon review).  But, as of now, I don't think I will buy BAAR Cola Syrup, (Old-Fashioned Remedy....?????), thin, watery, and most probably laced with High-Fructose Corn Syrup, ever again!<br /><br />Near the bottom of the front of the label, it proclaims that this cola syrup, ""Soothes Stomach Upset"".  But knowing I know now, this effect is, for my stomach, very, very temporary, at best.  H.F.C.S. -- ""High-Fake-Customer-Switcheroo"" syrup, is not something that I recommmend....for anyone!",2

B000KV61FC,"My dog LOVES this toy but the rope seems too big for the opening, making it virtually impossible to get out any treats.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer regarding this issue and was sent a new rope, just to make sure the bottle I had wasn't mismatched with the rope size.  The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the ""game"" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the ""mouth"" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game ""reasonably"" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope.",4

I was surprised to see how much impurities were buried in the tea leaves.<br /><br />To be honest, I have not seen that much impurities in a whole leaf tea of any kind (white, green, or black).

I have to boil it for at least 20 minutes to get it the texture I like.  That's a long time when you can boil angel hair pasta in 6 minutes and stir fry some veggies in less than 2 miinutes.<br />#2 - Even after 20 minutes of boiling, this pasta is super AL DENTE.  It just always seems like it's not cooked enuf.<br />I wish they had a thin angel hair version.<br />I couldn't even finish my dinner tonite.  After boiling 20 minutes, this stuff was just too hard. It was almost as gross as eating UNDERCOOKED rice.  Yes, it is gluten-free, but, it's got a thick, starchy texture that I can't stand chewing and it takes too long to cook.<br />IMHO, corn-quinoa pasta is better.<br /><br />Edit:  6-28-12<br />Tinkyada's FETTUCCINI in the red package is better.",3
B003QU2LYY,"I purchased a box of 16 of these half-and-half (black tea and lemonade) k-cups at Bed, Bath & Beyond.  They had a $9.99/box sale, and it was too good to pass up--especially since my better half loves lemonade iced tea.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was barely different from the ""Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea,"" and didn't have the bite of lemonade.  I wasn't expecting perfection--I realize that lemonade in any form is asking a lot from a hot beverage machine, but it was still a bit of a let down.  Also, I prefer to sweeten my drinks with Splenda.  (I don't need 13 grams of carbs from a glass of iced tea.)<br /><br />That said, my Keurig Limited Edition remains the best coffee machine I have owned to date, and the Coffee People ""Donut Shop"" variety is my favorite every-morning k-cup.",2
B003EML8PM,"If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the ""sweet spot"" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me. Otherwise, these things are tops !",4

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

B000BPR1AQ,"I bought this spray because it doesn't contain Deet and is in pump, not aerosol, form; however, its protection was meager.  I used it on a beach in Honduras to protect me from sand fleas.  My husband chose to use nothing.  I ended up with half the number of bites, but I still had many bites.  In even more insect-heavy areas of Central America, I had to resort to a Deet product because this Picardin-based repellent did little to discourage biting flies.  This is much better for mosquitos than for other biting insects.<br /><br />While I would use this spray in instances where the flying insects are bothersome but not relentless.  In areas where your health may depend on repelling insects, look elsewhere.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",2

We were right. After the first year, knobs and buttons started falling off, and month by month after that the tolerences opened up, and the whole thing fell apart. You could hear it creeking and groaning ever more loudly as it did so. Finally, after three years, it's dead.  You get what you pay for: in this case you'll pay $500+ for great expresso/coffee for three years.",2

Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.",1
B004R8J8E0,"You all know Amazon for its forward-looking attitude, and this is also obvious in the review pages. That's why, in this review of Shake and Bake Original Pork, I will be calling on my Aunt Agatha to do a special review for all of you.<br /><br />By Interpretive Dance.<br /><br />Agatha is getting on now, but in her day she hoped to be a prima ballerina (even though she only made it to centesimo ballerina). She studied under the expatriate star, Tumbelova, and her husband, Serge Trouserin, but to no great effect. But Agatha could never resist the lure of the tu-tu, and that's why we have her here today. And here she comes!<br /><br />Moving quickly yet forcefully, belying her many years, she is flying around the stage, waving here hands hither and thither. Ah, but now she has stopped, striking poses in just one spot. Now a slow but joyous circling of the stage, a plie here and there, almost in the style of George Balanchine. She's reminding us of the Degas painting, ""The Ballet Class,"" but more in imitation of the teacher than any of the dancers.<br /><br />And so this delightful moment ends, as Aunt Agatha slips off into the wings and onto a chair, breathing heavily. I think we can all divine what Shake and Bake Original Pork is like from such a performance, but for those who missed the significance, I can say that from eating it, it's somewhat bland, but probably just what the target market expects.<br /><br />No doubt, when she gets her breath back, Aunt Agatha will delight us with more interpretations, but for now, we'll let her rest. And you can feel proud of yourself that you were in at the beginning of a new kind of product review, thanks to Amazon.",4
B001ELLB4S,"I've tried all kinds of hemp powders and this is my favorite.  Hemp is a super source of EFA's and the protein is a highly available type due to the amount of different amino acids. It is good for those with animal milk allergies or who are concerned about cruelty to farm animals.  And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.<br /><br />Great, so it's healthy, but how does it taste?  Well, this hempshake is amazing -- the taste is really great.  I particularly like the chocolate.  And I'm impressed that although it tastes a 1000 times better than plain hemp powder, it only contains 80 calories and 7 grams of sugar.<br /><br />As for digestibility, they do add inulin, which is good for the gut, and I don't have any problem with it.  However, the high amount of fiber might present a problem for those coming straight from a SAD (standard American diet), so you might want to begin slow with a small drink and work up to the full dose.<br /><br />In fact, I'm drinking a Nutiva Hempshake smoothie right now for my breakfast.  It contains hempmilk (natch), choco hempshake, cayenne, cinnamon, and frozen berries.  It is awesome.",5

B00068PCTU,"NuStevia's White Stevia powder is amazing!  I have been on a low-carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and NuStevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  I love sweet things, and without them I don't think I'd have been able to stay on the low-carb diet.  I have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.<br />NuStevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you'll have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.<br />I'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again.",4

B007RTR9E2,"NOTE: This review is based several uses. I don't use hair conditioner very often because it weighs down my hair, but I thought I would be fair and give this product a try.<br /><br />At first, the smell of the product coming through the bottle was strong and overly sweet. What surprised me was that it actually has a pleasant, not overpowering smell once you squeeze it out of the bottle.<br /><br />As for the cons, the texture is thick and feels like heavy lotion. This worried me, because as I mentioned before, certain conditioners weigh my hair down. I used a dime sized amount and coated the top and bottom parts of my hair with the product, then rinsed thoroughly. However, when I tried to dry my hair, I realized it still felt heavy with conditioner. I had to rinse for a few more minutes before I could try to dry and style again. A week later, I tried again, unfortunately to the same results.<br /><br />I can see how this can benefit other users. This conditioner, however, is definitely not for me.",3

When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces.

B000SATIZA,"I recently purchased this product and thought it strange that it showed evidence of grit/dirt (i.e. when I steeped the tea in a glass jar I noticed that after pouring out the tea grit remained on the threads of the jar).  When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1/2"" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was ""If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund"".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated ""we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)"".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.<br /><br />Update (2/27/12) - Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.  Have not opened up the new bag to see if the quality has improved, but replacement bag was appreciated.",2
B000H121DQ,"My girls, a year-old mini Dachshund and an 8-year-old Papillion-mix, love all things chicken. (They literally turn their noses up at most beef-based treats!) They already love Zuke's chicken mini naturals, so I expected them to go wild for these z-filets.<br /><br />Nothing doing. I am not too impressed myself. Compared to the product description, ""basted chicken filet"", what we received just doesn't match up. I expected something chewier, textured, meatier, and tougher. What I found wasn't a ""filet"" which implies whole-cut, but a soft ""patty"" a pressed ground bits. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was veggie-based! I should have read the reviews first, though I thought I could rely on the official product description and the overall excellent reviews.<br /><br />These treats are described as ""ridged"" to help ""naturally clean dogs teeth and gums"", to promote healthy oral hygiene. But what I received in the package (which looks just like the package depicted) is a thin, flat, and very soft which couldn't help clean teeth, especially when they aren't very chewy. Which doesn't matter anyway, since my snooty dogs won't eat them.<br /><br />I suspect their reticence has to do with the strong garlic smell coming off the patties. I think it stinks, but that's never stopped dogs from eating things before! I even expected them to perhaps think I was giving them ""people food"" since our food is highly seasoned. They didn't buy it. It's likely not chicken-y enough for them. Who can tell.<br /><br />I won't stop ordering Zuke's products, but I will be careful to read how reviewers describe them as opposed to promotional copy.",2

B0069PDYR6,"Jack Mackerels are like big herrings, better known as sardines. They are headless and tailless, and they measure about the length of the can (perhaps by design).<br /><br />I saw a review in the listing for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GQ0W2Q"">Chicken of the Sea, Mackerel, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> that said something like they were God-awful or whatever. That's obviously a subjective POV, but I personally couldn't disagree more. THEY'RE SARDINES. Someone was bound and determined to get people not to eat these fish for whatever agenda. Personally I don't distinguish them taste-wise FROM sardines or herrings; they're just about twice or 3x the size. If you like sardines, you'll like jack mackerel.<br /><br />How to fix them? I like to open the can and dump them into a colander to drain away the salt brine they are preserved in. I do that with any canned good. Once out of the can, I like to bone them and put them in containers such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009P67Y4"">GladWare Deep Dish Containers with Lids, 8 Cups (64 oz) 3 containers</a> and put them in the fridge; I can make one can last a long while that way. The bones are edible, like those of other sardines; I just prefer not to eat them. If you need the calcium, though, that's a great natural source. Anyway, whenever I'm ready to use them, I can eat them as is, maybe warm one or two up in a pan. They're not at all salty. Sometimes I make a mackerel fried rice that's delicious too, with mushrooms, green peas, rice, then add one or two filets of mackerel. People have even made salmon croquettes except of course substituting with mackerel meat.<br /><br />Pick them up in your bare hand, and you see they have some heft to them. In fact, feeling how heavy they are in my hand makes me a little sad that they were once living creatures, but like all of us they were put on earth to serve a purpose. They come individually in a 15 oz or 425g can. Serving size is 1/3 cup - which is a dumb measurement. I'll say one mackerel is a serving. It says there are about 5 servings per can, and there are 5 fish in the can, so do the math. One serving is 80 calories, has 280 mg sodium, 12g protein, 40 mg cholesterol, & 3g total fat. A serving also has 25% daily requirement for calcium. So that's not bad really for one small fish!<br /><br />I know it's probably easier to find Chicken of the Sea brand products in the store than the other brands, at least in my part of the world, so if you've ever been curious about this inexpensive canned fish that's usually found with the sardines and canned salmon, go ahead and give it a try. People are feeding their pets with this, but trust me, it's perfectly fine for human consumption. Enjoy them, and I hope I've helped you make a decision that works for you.",4

There is no way that is acceptable to send to customers EXPIRED products and I will not be giving these to my dogs now as it's a safety issue. I requested a full refund from this seller but have yet to get any response whatsoever. How disappointing! Hoping Amazon will help with this. Awful buying experience. Beware you may be getting an expired box if you buy these.",1
B001EO776Q,"If you like a rich dark coffee, this product is NOT for you!  We'd been looking for an organic alternative, and I've tried some great ones, so we ordered this when it was on special.  Unfortunately, we ordered 6 cans to get the discount, and now we are stuck with organic, but very dull tasting coffee.  To make the best of it, we've bought other tried and true rich dark brands to mix with it.  Very disappointing!",2

B003R0LKSG,"I've been feeding Wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats. I believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy, happy cats and reduced vet bills, but still the cost of Wellness has been prohibitive. I was excited to see Felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so I am trying it. Just switched them over this week, so far so good. The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I've been looking), I think we'll stick with Felidae.",5
B004CLCEDE,"Not very pleased with this product.  First thing the writing on the package is so small, I could not read it.  Therefore I did not have a good idea of how to prepare on use these noodles.  Upon delivery since it as a hot day and the noodles are packed in water, they were very hot, not sure if that makes a difference but I would feel better if these were package differently.",2
B000E4AHUA,"I'm pumping at work and looked for a product to increase or maintain milk production. I started drinking this tea and thought perhaps it was working. It had a decent taste once I added the sugar. Unfortunately I noticed that my daughter started having really painful gas at night when I nursed at home. I couldn't figure out what had changed til I recalled the other reviews of this product. I stopped drinking the tea and her painful gas stopped. oh well, it was worth a shot!",2
B000FIXYCS,"Should really give this product a below zero review, but there's no choice about that. The first bite is okay, but after eating the whole sandwhich, I realized that my stomach wants to turn upside down, and the after taste is so terrible that I wanted to puke all the food I've eaten. It taste so yukky and horrible that it would not go away for awhile even though I gargle and drink lots of liquid. I wonder if there's a food poisoning in here. Will never ever buy this canned food again!!!",1
B001EQ5EJ6,"I've been looking for ground celery seed for at least 2 years.  It used to be always be avaialbe at grocery stores with the rest of the spices, but for some reason stopped being there.  Regular celery seed is easy to find, but not the ground version.  So, I found online.  I wanted McCormick (or some familiar brand).  I'm very satisfied with what I ordered - it's very good and fresh.  My only complaint is that I couldn't purchase a smaller quantity than two large 16 oz containers.  I don't use that much, so gave away the one container to a friend, and it will take me years to use 16 oz container that I kept!  :)  But, happy to now have found.  Hope for others that McCormick decides to package in smaller quantities.",5
B003VXFK44,"Take it from someone who was tried a lot of different K-cups, BUY THESE! The ""Breakfast in Bed"" blend is full of great flavor, roasted perfectly, and more importantly I have been choosing it over Green Mountain, which says a lot. It's true to its name, perfect for the morning.",5

B001O2IX8E,"My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first.",2
B001LG945O,It is a good thing the can is so small. The product is several cuts below Sunny Delight. Terrible!,1
B006QQ2P3M,"So, I have never been moved to write a negative review for Amazon but felt forced to with this waste of money and time...Having been a person who has had vivid dreams in the past and keeps a daily dream journal, I was very excited to receive this herb after all that I have read. The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly. BUYER BEWARE!",1

B001LG940E,"This is carbonated juice.  I love cherries, so I was excited to receive this product.  The taste is only fair.  I think it is something that a kid would like.  The cherry taste is more of a juice mixture taste, not a pure cherry flavor.  The good news is that this drink has no artificial sweeteners or added sugar.  A healthy alternative for those who would like a soda/carbonated beverage.  I would prefer soda water with lemon or lime over this drink.",2
B001KYK3OS,"This brand has very little going for it. I'm a huge ginger beer fan, in fact I'm drinking one right now, and I have to say that this doesn't come close to the other ginger beers Ive had in the past including my personal favorite ""Barritts."" Very little carbonation and ginger ""tang"" put this on the same level as ""Regatta's"" diet alternative.",2
B00068PCTU,"After years of using synthetic sweeteners like Equal and Sweet N Low, I realized their long-term effects and wanted to find a good alternative. NuStevia was a lucky discovery. It has virtually no bitter aftertase, it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good.",4
B00503DP0O,"Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.<br /><br />On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.<br /><br />On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse.",3

B000GB0THM,The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. Tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. I've had very fine rooibos versions of Early Grey so I know it can be done.,2

B001LG940E,"Switch Black Cherry soda had sort of a strange aftertaste to me. Perhaps it was because the soda is sweetened with fruit rather than sugar, or perhaps it was what I ate for lunch, but the flavor didn't excite me.<br /><br />I would say this is a pretty average tasting drink. I'm not a big fan of carbonated drinks as they are pretty harsh on your stomach, so I'd shy away from recommending this one.",2
B001SJR5EQ,"Thought I'd give these a try as the local grocery store that sells Peet's closed down recently and it costs about $8 to ship beans to my house.  Peet's Major Dickason's blend is one of my favorite coffees - a medium bodied, rich, and _complex_ bean (if you've never tried it, you should!).  I'm no coffee snob, but it has a certain finish to it that I haven't tasted in other beans - everyone that tastes it always asks what type of coffee it is.<br /><br />I don't think this bean and roast can match, but it's still a very, very good.  When you open the tin, you can see the oils still on the beans (this is essential to a rich tasting brew) and the aroma of the beans is simply fantastic.  The medium roast is just right for my wife and I but it definitely doesn't measure up to Peet's Major Dickason's blend.  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more of these beans.  The tins are a nice size and fill up my air-tight container to the rim and I've gotten complements on the coffee when I've served it to others.  A good buy and I'll probably try out a few other Kicking Horse roasts.",4

B000LR0PAM,"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

B001BDDTB2,"This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.",3

B000UBDKII,"I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee. However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothy's World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend.",3

B000IHNCQO,"If you are watching your carbs, this is a great little snack, it's what it says it is... baked cheese. It's actually pretty good, but very salty.<br /><br />They come in these little bowl shaped discs about the size of a nickle in little 1/2 ounce bags. Great for control of what you are eating so you don't just pour a big bowl of them (and because they are so salty). They are super crunchy but disintegrate in your mouth pretty quickly.<br /><br />So far, I've tried the Wisconsin Cheddar and the White Cheddar version. The white cheddar is basically the same, just has a little more ""bite"" to it. I'll be looking at the lower salt and popped versions soon to change it up a little and maybe cut some of the salt.<br /><br />Worth a try if you are low carb or if you just want something a little more healthy than chips - they are pretty low calorie per bag as well, but the bags are pretty small. They satisfy my mid-day crunch cravings though!",4

I've tried the brownie and the dark chocolate and sometimes have to swallow hard to get them down, along with some kind of beverage.  When these arrived the first thing I noticed was how soft and chewy and ""fresh"" they tasted- in comparison to the others which are very firm, if not hard, bars.  Wow.  That makes all the difference.  These went down like a dream, and while I'm not going to say you will love them like a Snickers, I will say that they don't taste bad at all and chew like a warm oatmeal cookie.  I am beginning to wonder if it is just this flavor which is so soft and tasty, or if my other bars are just old and hard.  All bought on Amazon, though.  In any case, they were MUCH better than expected!",4
B004YV80OE,I really wanted to like this product but found that it really did not have much flavor.  I had to add some grated Romano cheese to it to make it more palatable.

B000G0EP78,"Carbquik sounded too good to be true, but the price in Amazon (and I am surprised at this for isn't Amazon supposed to be the leader in good deals? Or did I just dream that?) is way too high. I have a need to cut down considerably on my carbs consumption and being the bread lover and all things requiring flour, really, I was amazed when I read this flour had 90% less carbs than the leading brand (would that be bisquick?). So I bought a box, no sense in wasting money if it was not going to deliver on the promise, and the very first thing I did was a Banana Nut Bread. It came out very tasty but please note the ingredients besides the flour have a lot to do with the final result. Used EasySweet and brown sugar Splenda instead of regular sugar, walnuts pecans and sliced almonds, cinnamon, heavy cream, etc and did about 3 loaves of what I can easily substitute for any banana bread found in my local supermarket. So that was a score! Next, I tried my luck making oatmeal cookies and these came out pretty tasty and I kept asking myself: ""Have I really created the ultimate, guilt free, less stress oatmeal cookie?"". This is not a perfect mix, by any means, but compared to what is being offered they seem to be one company that cares for that particular segment and equally deserving, in my opinion, of individuals such as myself and their needs and desires. That alone always elicits an emotional response on my part. I have been known to shed a tear or two of joy in my warm kitchen as I see the final products greeting me hello. Did Waffles and they also came out pretty tasty, have to make sure the ingredients and the recipe are bullet proof. I like to mix the flour with lots of cinnamon which according to science is a great glucose equalizer (did anybody said sugar challenged?, perhaps it is time to realize that sugar can take your joy away together with your teeth, if consumed avidly, which is the way I always consume it until now). So I went to netrition.com where I also buy some very good low carb varieties and was happy with the box. So much, in fact, that I just ordered a new one. I envision a day when the wonderful people of this great country will be able to enjoy sweets without the mortifying thought that it is not too healthy for such nice beings. So Carbquik works and if their nutritional information is accurate it is also a much welcome relief into a world where very little attention is paid and given to the needs and desires of people with some kind of restrictions. Now, don't get me wrong, that does not mean we (I count myself in the list) need to settle for subpar, less appealing product just because the situation demands it. No no no, like the song goes: ""you can have your cake and it too"" (bob dylan lay lady lay?) and that is exactly what I am intending on doing these Holidays, known for their tempting treats. Carbquik worked for me and I tip my hat (for a bold head must always be protected) to the makers of this helpful product. Not quite 5 Stars but 4.5 Stars For Sure! Happy Holidays and please make sure to compensate all the eating with a walk, swim or a run!",4

B000FH2Y16,"I am a huge fan of Two Leaves and a Bud.  They make a beautiful English Breakfast Tea and many others.  I ordered this giant box of White Tea being a Tea lover and especially a White and Green Tea lover.  The idea of Rose Pedals in my Tea was also enticing and I dreamed about early mornings on my deck, sipping White Peony Tea with Angels flying and Songbirds singing.  Not really. But I did have high hopes for this Tea and I was let down.  The leaves are too small, the Tea goes bitter quickly and it's hard to brew as the bag won't immerse easily in the water.

B004391DK0,"This stuff is pretty solid. Makes a decent enough pancake for being GF and makes a solid biscuit as well. What we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the Chebe mix. Between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix. The Chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy, but when you mix it with the bisquick, the bit of squishiness gives the dryer Bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs. So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it. Also, even though this mix has leavening agents in it, when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway, it tends to turn out better this way.",4

B000CRHQN0,"I was doing the 5-6 meal a day thing and trying to get some lean protein in between lectures until I could get some lunch. I work out and eat pretty healthy but was trying to lean up some more but as a college student don't always have the time and resources to cook a bunch of chicken breasts. Overall, these are pretty bad. They have low sugar, and are just about the cheapest protein bars you can get, but I'm 175lbs and these just don't really satisfy any hunger, and in fact only whet my appetite and make me hungry for some real food. I think the cheap price is just not worth the bad taste, and hunger they don't fill.  If you're looking for quick convenient good tasting protein that gives you a little sometime to go on, I would go for some protein powder like Syntha 6 or something, or at least get a little more expensive, slightly more sugary but more filling and better tasting bar like Builder Bars. These can be a last resort if you're just looking to stash them around here and there in case you find yourself without something to eat but you can definitely do better. If you're going to go against my advice, I would recommend getting the peanut butter instead of the chocolate, because cheap, fake, crappy peanut butter still tastes better than cheap fake crappy chocolate, and I've had both, the chocolate is much worse. Also, pair it up with an apple or banana or something to help fill you up a little more and have at least something with some nutritional value in there.",2

No ... the opinion of an Olympic skier made no difference whatsoever except to wonder who out there actually believed that an an olympic skier is a more qualified determiner of potato chip quality than anyone else.  Anyway - my first delivery showed these to be good chips.  5 star ... or nearly so.  Second delivery supported the first.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars an an average.  Chips, when well made and fresh are probably closer to 5 stars.  I can't quite recall where it turned but it was either the third or fourth delivery.  This next delivery showed up with the box itself soaked with oil and every single bag within the box slit down the back seam.  It should have been nearly impossible for the person packing it not to notice and its difficult for me to believe that 12 bags spontaneously burst down the back seam in transit.  I reported it, threw them all out and Amazon refunded the money (thanks Amazon).  Next delivery, while not split down the seam, were very very greasy.  The chips were practically dripping oil.  Most recent delivery ... same thing.  I'll chalk the split seam issue down to logistics but the last two scream of manufacturing process changes or cutbacks or simply a malaise in the process.  Whatever it is ... that's all it really takes to lose a customer.  Lay's makes an excellent kettle chip, best I've had to date, and they sell it at the local small market where we pickup our milk for $2.29 for an 8.5oz bag.  That's a better price per oz than I was getting here.  I'm off the Madhouse Munchies bandwagon.<br />Giving this 3 stars as an average but this chip has been on a 5 star to 1 star slide.  Clearly they know how to make a good chip.  For whatever reason they just stopped doing it.",3
B001RVFDOO,"For all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy, these chips are a great alternative!  No they are not like fried, but the flavor along with the calorie/fat benefits make this a great choice! I liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors I would like. As it turns out, I like them all! But I do have my favorites (like BBQ, salt & vinegar, and plain) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus.  I have already placed two orders since my initial purchase!",4
B0036QHQ5C,"I enjoy whole-roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",4

It is a tasty brew that is almost as good as their Moroccan Pomegranate Red Rooibos tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

B000KV61FC,The rope part of the toy that the dog is supposed to tug on to get the treats out is rubber and not rope as shown in the product pocture. My 45lb border collie mix chewed through that in almost record time.<br /><br />He really likes the toy. He just picks it up now by the knobby top and drops it to get the treats out. I will probably try to put an actual rope and stopper in to fix it. I am just disappointed that it wasn't as shown.,2
B006N3IG4K,"This is my favorite so far amongst the Wolfgang Puck K-Cups. The word that comes to mind when i sip it is ""Bright"". It has a natural sweetness and good flavor, without being overly heavy. The packaging lists it as a Medium Roast, but i'd put it more towards the light end of the spectrum. It's a very enjoyable cup, and i'd recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with Green Mountian's popular Vermont Country Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />I generally haven't been impressed with the Wolfgang Puck flavored varieties (Vanilla Francaie, Jamaica me Crazy), but this regular cup is quite good.",5

B002JX7GVM,"I've had Amy and Brians coconut water - yum!, Vico's plain in the tetra pack - great! (the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate - blah and yuck- don't get those!) , and the ones in the glass bottles- green cover- can't remember the name, but pure coconut water -great too.<br /><br />This, one with pineapple- no good.  The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy.<br /><br />I wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice! - no more!)",1

B004TI4SIE,"I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!!",3

B0081XIA1E,"Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.",3

B00166D8TW,"The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix",4

Note:  This is WAY cheaper on Tassimo.com, thus I don't feel so guilty throwing it out.",2

The vast majority and I mean vast majority of baking ingredients such as meal, flour, breads, i.e. are so so loaded with carbs and diabetics are limited to the amount of carbs one can eat during a meal and throughout the day.

Definitely held the piece solidly, but I almost damaged it getting it loose.  Be prepared to literally cut it out of its packaging.  A pain, but manageable.<br /><br />The piece itself was fairly well done, definitely not as good as the one in the illustration, but still a nice piece.  I will probably do some light trimming to give it a little more character before presenting to my friend.  The bowl and stone are nicely matched and the tuft of moss is a nice touch.",4

B0006TQ2TS,"The following review will incorporate the views of both the taster (in this case me) and the skilled chef (mom naturally!)  This saffron from first appearance and smell can easily be pegged as what we endearingly call ""the good stuff"".  The threads have a nice coarseness to them that are to be expected from top quality saffron.  Upon closer scrutiny we hardly found any hint of ""styles"", or in other words, the wasteful little white things at the end of the stigmas.  While the aroma gives a nice pungent and earthy smell, both my mother and myself still prefer the eau de toilette of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250QHZU"">Gathering Saffron</a>.<br /><br />Upon preparing a chicken kabob marination with this saffron, we were delighted with the marvellous color developing on the meat.  It was the classic golden hue with little crimson squiggles of the stigma remnants.  As effective a painter as this particular saffron was, my mother did mention to me that the only drawback was the quantity in which it took to get the desired effect.  Therefore its potency may be outperformed by other higher quality saffron brands.<br /><br />Once our banquet was ready to be served and I took the first bite, I was lost in its tangy and tart flavors.  The chicken barely stood up to the pressure of the knife and was incredibly tender in my mouth.  It was near impossible for me to leave any piece of such a delectable plate unfinished.  Though everyone out there may not necessarily get the same exact results, you will be far from disappointed if you purchase this.  So despite the better alternatives out there both my mother and myself recommend this saffron.",4

I bought three different candies from this seller which I had hoped would have saved on the postage but all three came in a bag and cost more than the products. It could have been sent in a priority box for a decent price and would have gotten here faster.  So the shipping was way too much. I usually love sugar free licorice but this is one time I was disappointed.  If you don't' mind anise instead of licorice this candy would be nice.  the individual wrapping does make it easy to put in purse or pockets. so it does have it's benifits.,2
B000G6RYNE,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!",4
B007OXJK3Y,This k cup is not one of my favorites. It takes more like alcohol than chocolate. I have had this problem with cheaply made chocolate syrups and coffee house drinks.

B000F8Y6JS,"I am terrible with sizes-and I thought these were the big nutella jars. They're not. They're the little tiny ones. So, by the time I paid for the item AND shipping, I would have saved about 15$ just buying them in my local grocery market. Plus, I called the company to ask if there was anything I could do to change to the bigger size, or if they even carried them for future purposes, and I heard NOTHING back.<br /><br />But the delivery (although not what I wanted) was prompt and it came with a free bottle of salad dressing.",3
B000FPM5DA,"The ten Munchy Stix are encased in a clear plastic shell backed by a bone shaped piece of cardboard. The chews are roughly five inches in length and look like little, thin salamis or slim Jims. Unlike the former, however, these rawhide chews are not soft and pliable, but rigid and crunchy. Each Stix is a compressed , cylindrical stick formed with bits of rawhide, chicken, and  pork. DingoÂ®  tells us that these Stix have the same great taste as the larger chicken/rawhide chews in an easy to chew treat. Further, we are told, these Stix are healthy and fun to chew, helping to promote clean teeth and gums.<br /><br />Ingredients: Rawhide, chicken, Pork, Water, Corn, Sugar, Salt, Potassium sorbate, Red 40.<br /><br />Both of our dogs and their occasional guests love these Stix. I don't know how much chew value they have because they're totally consumed in about five minutes, sometimes longer for little Piper. I'd rather these were manufactured in the US and not China, but so far through many packags of Stix our dogs have had no ill effects and still look forward to their Stix.",4

This time, however, I noticed some very hard pieces when chewing the nuts and after examining more closely, do think somehow shells got into the nuts as they were being shelled.

B000VK8HCW,I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.,1

B004ZIER34,"If you're looking at this product, it's probably because you're like me and the acid in regular coffee is enough to cause fiery backwash within minutes or hours of drinking it. This coffee solved that problem for me, short & simple. I am reviewing this for Amazon vine and I'm not afraid to be honest.<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is very much like a Starbucks decaffeinated Italian roast, but the smell is more like a Whole Foods Sumatran blend/roast. If there were any complaint, the lack of acidity does take away a little bit of the ""hit in the mouth"" that you normally expect from coffee.  That being said, it also worked well for making iced coffee.<br /><br />And-- no acid reflux! So in that, it is as advertised.",4
B001LG945O,"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it.

It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.

It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either).

OK but what do you do with the leftover sweetener? The packets cannot be resealed and this stuff is as sticky as honey.

For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of ""frosting"" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much ""sweet cardboard"".

Just soaking doesn't create a nice pasta texture, but actually cooking them turns them into clumpy/mushy mess.

I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged.  As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry.  I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee.  I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success.

B004CT1NCY,"This really knocks you out and gives you great sleep without feeling any hangover. It's amazing. (It's also quite tasty, kinda like Snapple only if you drink too much you turn into Rip Van Winkle.) A family member recommended it and I'm glad I tried it. I wish it wasn't so expensive and more available though. Often, Amazon is out of stock and nowhere else on their website is listed as a seller.<br /><br />Update: I've noticed that since I started drinking this every once in a while when I have sleep issues, even if months have lapsed at a time, I've become more tolerant to the effects of the drink. (I found this, also, when I took Valerian pills directly. Valerian root is one of the ingredients.) So one bottle or two doesn't really put me to sleep anymore. This might just be me but I'd suggest not using it too often to avoid becoming tolerant. Just use it when you really need it...which I do but I tend to become tolerant to things very quickly. I wouldn't mind if the cost wasn't so exorbitant. Drinking two bottles a night can become pretty pricey if I'm having a week of insomnia. The thing is despite the price this does really beat the side effects of a lot of the sleep aids out there and trust me, I've tried A LOT of them. This is great for once in a while when your sleep schedule gets out of whack.<br /><br />Also, I discovered that Walmart sells the drink for $20! And it ships free if you purchase more than $45 so it's worth going over to Walmart to get 3 cases at a time.",3

The really good kind that makes you glad the cups are small, and the not-so-good kind that makes you long for the kind your mother used to make.  This pudding falls in the second category.  This pudding is okay on an occasional basis, but the chocolate flavor seems a little off.  It is difficult to describe what I mean, but the flavor just does not quite have the power of home-made chocolate pudding.<br /><br />I have tasted a number of other pre-made puddings, and several of them are very good.  The vanilla and the tapioca are generally very good to excellent.  The lemon is also very good.  However, the chocolate seems to fall short in tast quality, and while I will eat it occasionally, if you have a choice between home-made and this one, choose the home made.",3

Not too long ago I spotted Ambrosia Creamed rice (in 15-ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.<br /><br />Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",4
B005CUU25G,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.",3

B00503DP0O,"For a healthy, alternative snack bar that is wheat-free, gluten-free and non-dairy and contains a host of dull ingredients like gluten-free oats and organic agave, I think Pamela's has done a superior job perfecting taste with their Whenever Bars (Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut) ... and (thankfully!) NO high fructose corn syrup to boot!<br /><br />The bars certainly live up to their ""moist and chewy"" label description. I mean, come on, how much magic can you whip up on such a limited and boring ingredient budget?  With these limitations in mind, Pamela's has created a pretty delicious snack that may not be the most filling thing to eat, but then again, how many snack bars (healthy and of the junk food variety) really do the trick and fill you up like, let's say, a decadent hot fudge sundae!<br /><br />Although the chocolate was a bit sparse, as far as the amount of coconut - think macaroons! For coconut lovers, this snack bar should be on the top of the shopping list. I would have given these  Whenever Bars a five-star rating, and the only reason that I knocked off one star was that my 16-year-old daughter, who was my fellow taste tester, complained about an aftertaste. At least now, I don't have to worry about MY Whenever Bars disappearing!",4

B004LLAYC8,"The coffee itself is a decent brew - the flavor is there, but it just seems muted.  It's not as robust as other ""Donut"" coffees.  These are marketed along with the EkoBrew K-Cup replacement, which is how I have been using them.  The thing is - these ""single serve packets"" don't fit into the Ekobrew K-cup - there is too much coffee. There is no practical way to ""save"" the remaining grounds for use another time/day.  I don't drink the same flavor every day, so it would be a few days before I rotate back to this flavor, and then I'd have to open another package to even out the amount - leaving me with another partial package.<br /><br />In summary: taste is there, but not ""rich"" like other donut coffees.

There is no pump on the bottles, although you can buy one.<br /><br />I think it's generous to call these ""syrup"" as they are the consistency of water.  But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.<br /><br />I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.<br /><br />My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.  We haven't tried the Irish cream flavor yet, but I've used it in coffee before and I'm sure it will be the same.<br /><br />Overall, this is an expensive indulgence (for me) but one I'm glad I tried.",4

B000F0JOV6,I make lasagna for our annual family gathering so I was excited that I found a GF  lasagna noodle so I could eat the same dish as the family. I typically pre-boil my noodles but the instructions on the rice noodles said no boiling was needed. So I made my recipe and refrigerated it for 2 days as usual. I cooked it for 50 min let it stand for 10 min before serving. I was disappointed that the texture was mushy - not the same firmness as the wheat pasta noodles. Perhaps it would have worked better if I made it immediately before cooking and cooked it for a shorter time.,2
B000ETAJZI,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.",2

B005K4Q1VI,"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.",1
B008FVVDG6,I agree with the other reviewer about these tasting nothing like a real latte. The Maxwell House ones are much much better. The problem is that the vanilla flavor that they used to flavor the espresso is extremely strong and powerful but it has such an artificial taste to it. Brewing it did give my house a wonderful vanilla fragrance and it didn't taste completely horrible which is why I am giving it some stars...I will drink the rest of the package however...I would never buy this again. The plain lattes with a little bit of vanilla syrup are exponentially better. I do have to say that the creamer that comes with this though is the best creamer I have had from the tassimo line. That said...I won't pay this price just for a slightly sweeter creamer disc.,3
B006G7XV7A,"If you like beef jerky that is dry, over salted and super tough then Oberta Peppered Thin Style is sure to please. Despite being very tough in the first place the poor meat quality contained large amounts of gristly material that simply could not be chewed. The peppered flavoring was not bad and the only notable highlight in an otherwise terrible product. So two stars on the review. Otherwise this is worst quality jerky I have ever tried.",2
B001RVFDOO,"I first tried them after a product get together at Jelly Belly in Fairfield, Ca. I was so pleased, that I wanted more!  Well my Husband said he saw some at Costco so he got a few flavors and boy was I hooked. I sent my Grandsons in Idaho a box of 24 mixed small packages and also a friend in Ohio the same thing.  I am on a calorie counting diet along with my Husband and we eat the popchips almost every day. I like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you...alot better then baked or fried.  I am sold and really enjoy them...you came up with a fantastic product.  Sincerely, Viki Crabtree",5
B007OXJK3Y,"This is based on the Donut House base coffee flavor with a supposedly chocolate donut taste. The base Donut House coffee flavor is mild/smooth with a strong bitter aftertaste. It smells great while breaing, like you're in a donut shop but that's where the similarity ends.  The ""chocolate donut"" flavoring doesn't really come through in the coffee except that the strong bitter aftertaste becomes a strong bittersweet aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried this on both 10oz and 8oz sizes thinking the flavor was being diluted but it only made the flavors more intense... It didn't change the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the Donut House coffee flavor you might want to give this a try but if you dislike the Donut House coffee I don't think you'll find this any better.",3

B001E5DRJ6,"the Bergamot used here smells and tastes like rancid Lychee nuts, so if you are just looking for a pleasant black tea, pick something else.  A tea at this price point should not be using ""flavoring"" but the real essence, oil or dehydrated Bergamot citrus fruit.  The leaves are cut up into 2mm bits, so you must use a paper filter when seeping this loose tea.  The double capped tin does a fine job of air sealing the tea, so there is no need for an inner foil wrapper as others have contested.",3

B001PMDYZA,"I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.",3

The sun-dried tomatoes looked and smelled great, and they tasted even better - I ate many of them straight from the bag.  Unfortunately I re-ordered and the second shipment was awful.  The tomatoes were over-dried, dark brown in color, and smelled burned.  Worst of all they tasted horrible in everything I've tried to use them in so far.  Honestly I think I'll probably throw away the rest before I have to throw away any more dinners prepared with these.  A huge disappointment after my initial impression, and due to the cost of a 5 lb. bag.",1

B004ZIER34,"I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two. Just heat it up and serve me. Normally, I use a one-cup instant bag with boiling water and I get a fairly decent cup of coffee from Folgers using theirs or any store knock-off.<br /><br />Those taste like gourmet compared, and are certainly much better than the ""coffee"" I made this morning from Puroast's French Roast 3-ounce bag.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have stated it tastes like gas, ashes, fuel and I agree. Add to those descriptions a hint of motor oil, old basement and a sprinkle of dog dander.<br /><br />I opened the container and was greeted with an ashy, somewhat mildew-like odor. Oh well, keep going, I say. I boiled water and let a bag steep in the pot for a while as I don't like drip. I feel you get a much better full flavor from steeping. It took a while for the dark color to appear, but soon it looked very coffee-like and I put some in a mug. I smelled it first, noticing that it lacked a standard coffee scent. Then I tasted it with exactly the result I was expecting, a decidedly un-coffee flavor. Stale, with a hint of dried leaves? That's the best I can come up with. So, I added sweetener (stevia) and my usual cream (vanilla soy milk). It still tasted nothing like real coffee to me.<br /><br />I didn't give the mug a chance to comfort my stomach, poured it out and made a regular cup of joe that I could drink. Seriously, this is simply not a good product in my estimation. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I guess in a dire emergency this drink could possibly give you enough caffeine to limp, crawl or otherwise slither out to a store to buy actual coffee or at least be served something warm by the Red Cross.",2

And please don't think that I must live in some metropolis of cool where all foodstuffs are available at all times.  I live in West Virginia.

B002NHYQAS,"THE QUICK TAKE:  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is a great chocolate option.  At 54% cocoa solids, it's just over the edge of dark chocolate.  So it makes a nice change for those wanting dark chocolate that isn't so dark.  And, it's sustainably and responsibly produced - making it as guilt-free as chocolate gets.  The price at Amazon varies and can be high, so you'll need to look at the current price and your other options to decide what works for you.<br /><br />TASTE AND TEXTURE:  To have a little fun, we did a taste comparison to some other chocolate we had in the house.  The Newman's Own Dark Chocolate compared well to other premium and organic chocolate we had. It's decidedly darker, less sweet and firmer than a milk chocolate, with a very nice texture both to chew and on the tongue.  And it has some really nice subtleties to the flavor.  But it's not nearly as strong as what aficionados would consider a ""dark"" chocolate.  So it's a good option that might just hit the (bitter)sweet spot you are looking for in chocolate.<br /><br />PRICE:  These bars are relatively expensive.  That's to be expected for a premium chocolate that's organically produced.  We're lucky enough to have a lot of options for locally for organic chocolate.  Newman's Own is an excellent product, but you will want to compare it to the other options available to you.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: There are two important aspects that make this chocolate as guilt-free as chocolate gets:<br /><br />First, organic production.  Newman's Own has one of the largest organic chocolate sourcing operations in the world, which is highly commendable.  So you and your family get great tasting chocolate without consuming other things you don't want to eat; and, you also get the knowledge that the producers are working to minimize the impact of your consumption on the places where the chocolate is grown.<br /><br />Second, responsible sourcing.  Far too few people know that most of the world's cocoa production is tainted by child labor and often forced labor - or, in plain terms, slavery.  If that's news to you, Google chocolate slavery for some eye-opening information.  Or have a look at some of the Amazon listings, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN1VQ"">Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet</a>.<br /><br />All of that is a lot to fit into a chocolate bar - but Newman's Own has done that, and more, and offers you a lot of excellent options in chocolate.  If this one doesn't suit you, there are several more on Amazon.",4

After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is ""chewy"" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a ""candy"" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all.",2
B002M55HUY,"So, I like chocolate covered espresso beans.  Like is probably too weak a word... I seriously love these things.  So, imagine my excitement when I saw Koppers decaffeinated espresso beans, for a reasonable price, in large quantities.  I pictured all the delicious, none of the jittery regret.<br /><br />So I ate a few.  And a few more.  And thought nothing of it beyond the horrible empty calories.  But now it is 2am and I am completely wired.  I seriously can feel my heart beating through my chest and it is uncomfortable.  Fortunately, I am a grad student who always has studying to do so I will just spend all night going over notes.  But be warned internet people... these things pack a punch.  If you eat them with reckless abandon as I have done... you may never sleep again.",3
B001E76570,"The sound of this cereal just screams deliciousness, two of my most favorite things in a breakfast cereal, nothing more exciting then that.  I was holding my breath as I bought this cereal, not setting high expectations for a kellogs cereal but was I surprised in a good way.  Loaded with flavor of cinnamon on crunchy flakes and pecans in every bite.  Usually when you get a cereal that says there are nuts in it you have to search for them, but in this cereal they are in every spoonful, and they are no small dinky nuts either, they are a nice size to satisfy that nut flavor.  There are so many different textures going on and flavors as well from crunchy corn, cinnamon, buttery tasting pecans, so delicious.  I hope that this cereal sticks around because it has to be one of kellogs masterpieces for sure.",4
B008C2JCUW,"This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Amazon and I ended up tossing it - so no refund.<br /><br />I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Easy-clean-easy-Azulene/dp/B00011JN56/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291331352&sr=8-1",1

B001VJ1IE6,"Okay, I admit it.<br />I was sucked in my the most adorable, romantic commercials for a cat food product that I have<br />ever seen. I vowed to buy at least some Fancy Feast each week just to show my support for that commercial!  LOL<br /><br />The cats love the wet food. It is very expensive, and from what I have read on the labels, you are<br />definitely paying for the IMAGE, not the quality or quantity of the food. (The cans are only 3 ounces<br />compared with 5.5 ounces in the other can styles.) I still get it, and they love the ones with cheese the most.<br /><br />So, I thought we'd give the dry food a try. I had my husband grab a bag when he was at the grocery store.<br />How bad could it be, right?  Same company, same ""gourmet"" promotion on the foods, so surely it has great stuff<br />in it, right?  Well, shocker - NOPE.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is made by the Purina company in St Louis, MO. They are the same ones who make the generic dog chow,<br />cat chow, rabbit chow, ________ (fill in the blank) critter chow.  They are all full of fillers that animals don't need,<br />because it is cheap to manufacture. Why I thought this might be different, I do not know.<br /><br />First off, food mfgs have found the kitty equivalent of addictive MSG, and load their foods with it.<br />This one is no different. Note that BOTH our cats went crazy over this food, inhaling it out of my hand<br />before I could even get more out of the package. Fancy Feast knows how to make things that smell/taste good to cats.<br />However, most food mfgs know how to make things that TASTE good - how they got there, well, you might not really want to know.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients list (which is in the order of the QUANTITY of the item) for this ""gourmet"" cat chow - bear with me, this is<br />a really long list of iffy ingredients, artificial junk and food coloring):<br /><br />Brewers Rice<br />Poultry By Product Meal<br />CORN GLUTEN meal<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Soybean Meal<br />Animal Liver Flavor<br />Chicken<br />Turkey<br />Phosphoric Acid<br />Calcium Carbonate (in case they get indigestion?! This is what's in Tums!)<br />Salt<br />Natural & Artificial Flavors (more unspecified stuff?)<br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dried Yeast<br />Choline Chloride<br />Added Color, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2 and ""other colors"" (Why?!?)<br />Taurine<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Ferrous Sulfate<br />Vitamin E Supplement<br />Niacin<br />Manganese Sulfate<br />Vitamin A Supplement<br />Calcium Pantothenate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Copper Sulfate<br />Riboflavin Supplement<br />Vitamin B12 Supplement<br />Pyridoxine<br />Hydrochloride<br />Folic Acid<br />Vitamin D3 Supplement<br />Calcium Iodate<br />Biotin<br />Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (a form of Vit K)<br />Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />Sounds yummy, huh?<br />The meat is way down the list, after all the corn, soybean and rice fillers and glutens.<br /><br />How on earth does cat food need artificial food dyes?  The cats won't care.<br />There are many known reactions to food dyes in people - I am sure our pets don't need it either.<br />Was the food too yellow with all the grain meal and gluten, or too white from all the fats?<br /><br />So, the cats love it. I will now consider this the equivalent of a bag of potato chips for humans -<br />okay some times, but NOT all the time. I'll have to watch our oldest cat. He gets super itchy with wheat<br />grain or gluten in foods, so I'll watch for reactions to the corn.<br /><br />Cats are carnivorous, and do not eat grains in the wild. However, especially with the manufacturing plant<br />smack dab in farming country, they can apparently get all kinds of leftover grains cheap?<br /><br />If you buy this for your kitties, just know that you are buying the IMAGE more than a quality food.<br />This is not really different than the super cheap pet foods that cost half as much or less.<br />But the bag is nice and shiny and the photo of the kitty is cute.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed to read that ingredients list, when they could do SO much better for our pets.<br />We'll use this as their treats, rather than their main dry food. We'll stick with our Blue Buffalo for that, which is<br />grain free and actually has meat for the first ingredient!<br /><br />Fancy Feast - marketing genius, but sloppy on the nutrition.",3
B001AJ1ULS,I wish I had come to the Amazon site before purchasing this product at my local Wegman's. The 'Product Of China' was printed so small it was easy to overlook.

Friskies phased out the original formula and REPLACED it with ""Classic Chicken PATE with Brown Rice"" (PATE IS ON THE LABEL OF THE NEW FORMULA).<br />My cat LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies ""replacement"" formula is different (texture is nearly the same, so it has to be in the ingredients) MY CAT DOES NOT LIKE THE NEW FORMULA.  I believe this is an outrage.  Displaying one picture and then sending an entirely different labeled can?  I am disappointed in Amazon.  NOW, imagine the shipping expense to return 5 cases of canned cat food???? I had to separate the cases from the huge box in order to even lift them into the house!......$73+ down the drain.

B004DIXWG4,"When I was a kid, my mom would save money by making Tang with less than the recommended amount of powder. That's what this stuff tastes like. The first two ingredients are water and corn syrup, which I guess explains the flavor, like a thin orange soda that's gone flat. And despite the claim to be ""Vitamin C Fortified,"" that's the only nutritional value this stuff has. It doesn't even have very much of that.

B000LKXFBK,"In my extended family, we have diabetics, low carb-ers and a few who are gluten intolerant. I tried the Mrs Leeper's creamy tuna but we find it's on the bland side and just not as tasty as Tuna Helper.<br /><br />Instead I buy gluten free pasta and low carb pasta and packages of Tuna Helper (which I get for around 1.70 each) and I make two separate Tuna Helpers, one using gluten free pasta and one using low carb pasta. It's no more expensive than buying the Mrs. Leeper tuna dinners and in fact is probably a bit cheaper, it tastes better and I can satisfy the needs of both the diabetics and the gluten intolerant members of the family. I can also add as little or much pasta - either low carb or gluten free - as is necessary for how many people will be eating it. Like alot of the other reviewers, I also add more tuna than the recipe calls for and a veggie.<br /><br />My husband and I are both type 2 diabetics. I save the regular pasta that comes in the Tuna Helper meal and when I have guests who can eat regular pasta, I serve it to them so we all get what we need/want and I'm not wasting anything.<br /><br />One last thing is that Tuna Helper comes in several varieties so we don't get tired of it. I serve it probably at least once a month.",2

It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin.

B004YMQ4KU,"I ordered this product because i love pasta but need to start modifying my diet because i want to start fighting competitively again and need to get myself back to peak performance. I was skeptical from all the talk of ""fishy smell and taste"". Thus being the reason i ordered the single pack. I prepared them as instructed and prepared them into a soup. I used chicken breasts cut into strips, boiled them into a broth with sliced carrots, green onions, and broccoli, and then poured it into the bowl over the noodles. Me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great. She put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way, but we both loved it. It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work. I work 10 hour night shifts, so that's why i ate this before work. These are a great tool into any nutrition plan in my book.",5

Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.,4

B0018CE6DQ,"Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying",2
B0076YVPFC,"I tried this for lunch at work once, and I regretted not bringing something else. The sauce is great, it doesn't taste like a ton of preservatives nor does it leave an aftertaste like these kinds of sauces often do. The real problem is the pasta. It tastes, to put it bluntly, like cardboard. I've had whole grain many times before, and I know it doesn't normally taste like that. I wasn't so disgusted that I couldn't eat it, but the whole time I wished I had something else.<br /><br />The serving size was an additional problem. Maybe good for a really light lunch when you're home, but no good when you've been at work and you'd like something to satisfy you. When I finished this I had to run out to buy something else because I was still pretty hungry. It felt like I had a snack more than anything.",2
B00317Y3HK,"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.",2

B000DZFMEQ,"If you have been deprived of sandwiches for a long time because of a gluten sensitivity , this bread mix may seem like a treat. On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten-free loaves, such as the Prairie bread with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the bread to rise as I would a non-GF bread. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been -- in any event the resulting bread did not rise properly in several attempts. Flavor is not that great, but I did make some ""everything"" bagels which were fairly tasty if not very light.",3

I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products.",1

B0041NYV8E,"If you don't like ginger then don't pick up a ginger drink, but if you like ginger then I do suggest Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage. It has a very intense ginger taste to it, much stronger ginger flavor then I was expecting and a very very mellow lemon flavor that is so mellow because the ginger just takes everything over.<br /><br />The smell of the drink when you first open the package it ginger overload, to me smelled like a gingerbread cookie with some lemon on top. Getting your drink just right is very easy, just open and pour your contents into a cup and add your choice of water and stir. Easy as 1 2 3 and your done. No need to sweeten your drink as it is already sweet with honey already inside.<br /><br />Can be served two different ways: hot & cold but I have to say I would prefer the hot way as it is very soothing to drink. Ginger is a wonderful way to settle your upset stomach and the fact that this drink mix is caffeine free is another bonus for that means I can drink it at any time and not have to worry about it keeping me up at night.<br /><br />If you like ginger check it out, for as a fan of ginger drinks/teas I have to say this has to be one of the better ones that I have tried.",4

B003EML8PM,The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.,2

I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.",2

B000PDY3P0,"I ordered the Little Bambino popcorn popper along with a 24ct. box of this popcorn.  All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a breeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.<br /><br />Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.  I tried to alter the steps in different ways hoping the popcorn would come out better but it just didn't work out for us.<br /><br />Gonna give good 'ol Mr. Redenbacher a shot next.  Now I just need to figure out how to cancel my 'popcorn subscription'.",1

B001EQ55RW,"Chocolate and nuts, two things that are great by themselves, but even better together!<br /><br />I love almonds, raw, roasted, spicy, sweet, you name it. So when I had the opportunity to try these I jumped on them.<br /><br />The first thing I did was read the label and I was disappointed to see that they added artificial flavoring and sweetener to them, not exactly my favorite thing to read on a label. Nonetheless I cracked the package open and tasted.<br /><br />After eating a small handful I was glad to see that they weren't overly sweet and you still tasted the almond.<br />The chocolate coating is a dry coating, so it doesn't melt off or leave a sticky residue. Sadly though I found the chocolate to be a bit weak and more of a semi-sweet, not dark.<br /><br />The nuts themselves were high quality, not a single one was over roasted or left a bitter nasty taste in my mouth, Diamond definitely provides a high quality nut!<br /><br />Overall these are a great snack, barely sweet and with a hint of cocoa. That and they are a good source of protein and vitamin E.",4

I was really tempting to try one, but i didn't.. lol<br /><br />But why 4 stars? 2 reasons that I give this 4 stars although my dogs and I really love it.<br />1. It's only 5 oz.. It's about $1.4 per 1 oz. I don't mind spending money on good stuff, it's a lil bit pricy for me..comparing to other comparable treats that sell for $9-12 per a pound. (it's just my opinion)<br />2. Not good for training. They're little bit chewy for small dogs.. My dogs chew one treat for a long time.(about 15-20 sec) They're good for snacking though..<br /><br />Anyway, although I gave this product 4 stars, I really highly recommend this for the quailty and deliciousness..",4

The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and don't provide a 'zing' to the dish.<br /><br />It's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.",3

B001EQ5KUO,"Got this as a Christmas gift as I put it on my wish list. Looked pretty good. Within the price range of family.<br />However, I am used to buying premium tea from other sources. And now I know why and why I will continue to do so.<br />I was first shocked to find that the tea was in shards, crumbled pieces. This takes it down a notch for experienced, premium tea drinkers. It makes one think we're getting the leftovers of the higher grade harvests. When infused, the leaves maintain a flat, crumbled shape, they don't unfold into beautiful leaf structures. I believe this hinders the flavor of the infusion.<br />The flavor? The madarin is very nice. A pleasant, citrus flavor, subtle, delicate. However, it's difficult to detect a very noticable white tea flavor. Contrary to popular opinion, white tea does indeed carry a sweet soft tea flavor. In some ways the citrus notes overpower the tea flavor. Perhaps this is to cover up a lower grade white tea harvest.<br />It's not horrible, just disappointing. But, you get what you pay for and three tins at the price offered, you'll get a lot of cups of tea, just not the best quality. BTW, you can infuse this tea more than once, but if you want to save it in another container in the refrigerator for the next infusion, be prepared to have to scrape it out of the tea strainer because it infuses flat against the screen.",2
B001CGTN1I,"I bought the Navitas Naturals Chia seeds.  They are great.  I put them in a shaker bottle.  I use them on sweet potatoes, in salads and coleslaw and just learned that they can replace half of the fat in baking.  At first I didn't know if it was lowering my blood glucose or if it was something else but I confirmed it the other day.  I had stopped using the seeds and my morning blood glucose shot up to the 140's.  I decided to start using the seeds again and within a few days my blood sugars dropped to the 120's and the only thing I changed in my diet was the addition of chia seeds.  I love them.  I haven't made the gel yet I have only used them raw and they are like eating poppy seeds which I love.  Hope this will help other diabetics.  Navitas is a quality product and is very reasonably priced.  I will definitely continue to buy them.",5

There appears to be no land option, airmail only.

B004ZIER34,"Since I suffer from GERD, or acid reflux (heartburn), I was immediately interested in this product.  It's a good idea, since I (like billions of other people around the planet) love a cup of coffee in the morning.  But coffee is a big no-no for those with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder).<br /><br />I brewed it up in my Chemex coffee maker (all glass, no plastic parts).  My first impression was that it is a dark roast, which I'm not particularly fond of.  (The company, according to its website, offers two styles of coffee.  The dark French roast was what was sent to me.  They also offer a 'nutcracker sweet' flavor).  Secondly, the grind is very fine, which releases more flavor, but takes longer to drain through my filter.<br /><br />The taste (which is the important thing, right?) is strong and slightly bitter.  When I added sugar and creamer, the taste was tamed into something more than I'd like.  The flavor is unchanged from a regular coffee flavor, which is certainly a big plus.<br /><br />I could tell right off that the coffee was less acid than traditional coffees.  And it certainly didn't set off my GERD (though mine usually comes later in the day).<br /><br />One caution I'd issue though.  According to the pamphlet on GERD I just picked up from the doctor's office, one reason (the principal one?) that one should avoid coffee and certain sodas is the caffeine in coffee.  I assume that the coffee has all of the 'kick' that traditional coffee has.  So it seems that one drawback to coffee (acid) has been solved, but the other (caffeine) remains.  I'll finish off this small bag and see what I think.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'd recommend this coffee to the lover of a strong dark French roast.  I think I'd prefer the Nutcracker Sweet variety, personally.  The coffee costs about the same as regular coffee, according to a quick price survey I ran on Amazon.",4

B005H3BYHI,"As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy!",4

This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.<br /><br />I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing.",2

B002LN3A7E,"****<br /><br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br /><br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br /><br />****",4

Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the ""soup"" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it).

So I was really wanting this coffee to be ""the one.""<br /><br />I invited 3 friends over to help me try it. The consensus was that Dan found it a little weak, Harry could really tell there was less acid in it and Gayle gave it 5 stars because it didn't ""bowl her over"" with harsh flavor.<br /><br />As for me, I loved the smoothness of the brew best of all. I did find it on the weak side after the initial velvety taste went over the tongue. The flavor was rather bland. There was no over-all deep, full-bodied taste, but with the beans adjusted to exclude acidity, I didn't think there would be.<br /><br />I would drink it again, but probably wouldn't buy it. As the title says:  A Decent Average Coffee",3

It only took me 3 minutes or so to become fully alert despite having had no sleep for more 30 hours.<br /><br />i've used it several times since then for all-night studying but i'm not sure why but the impact has slightly decreased every time. also, remember that it keeps you up but that doesn't mean that your attention span will be better.<br /><br />All being said, I would still use it but not very frequently--only when I need to.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)",3
B001EO5QZK,"I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.  It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.",4
B000KFXEYE,"So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!!",3
B001TLY7A8,"I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).""<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content.",1
B004WM0ZTS,"I am a self proclaimed coffee guy. I enjoy chatting about coffee with the manager of my local Starbucks. I also have my own burr grinder, French press, espresso maker and 2 drip coffee makers (2 cup and 12 cup). So where does VIA fit into my coffee life? I typically use a VIA packet when I want a quick cup of coffee and don't want to take the time or effort to brew a pot (12 cup or 2 cup coffee makes).<br />Pros:<br />* Fast and convenient.<br />* Taste great for an instant coffee - it is not quite as good as fresh brewed but remarkably better than other instant coffee.<br />Cons:<br />* It is expensive. So watch the price on Amazon it will vary greatly over time. I tell my wife we are not ""Pay the full price people"". Put the item in your cart and then if u have time check your cart daily for a while. (I do this for all Amazon purchases since the price does really fluctuate for most items). For VIA I have found that watching it can save me 50% or more on Amazon - the price of this item locally never changes much.<br />* It is not the same as good brewed coffee. Don't expect this to be the same as fresh brewed coffee - all else constant (I.e. filtered water etc.)",4

B000OQWAS0,"This is very similar in flavor to Kusmi St. Petersburg, although St. Petersburg is far superior in complexity of flavor. Ultimately, I find Paris to be a little boring.<br /><br />I've noticed that the caffeine in Paris makes me feel jittery for some reason. I drink black tea every morning and don't have this problem with other brands. Not sure why Paris seems intensely caffeinated in comparison.<br /><br />For those who'd like to try this tea without breaking the bank, I've found Paris and other selections at The Fresh Market for just $5.99. My local grocery store carries a few flavors as well, all for around $6. H&S Dragon Pearl Jasmine is my favorite from this line.<br /><br />If you're willing to shell out $15-20 for a tea, try Kusmi instead.",3

B00068PCTU,"If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5
B004L54ST4,"I bought this for my mother on the recommendation of my family physician.  He said my mom has iron deficiency anemia.  As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen. As a result, iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath.  The solution: boost your iron intake.<br /><br />One tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70% RDA of iron and it tastes pretty good too.  If you like the taste of black licorice, I'd say you'll probably like the taste of this.",5

B008O3G25W,"I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there.",3

B004YV80O4,"My box showed up today around noon, which solved the question of ""What's for dinner?""  I've been looking forward to trying this ever since I heard about it -- I'm a big Hamburger Helper fan (have been ever since I moved out on my own some 20 years ago).  I figured this would be Hamburger Helper with real cheese rather than cheese powder.<br /><br />Preparation is easy; brown the ground beef, drain, add 2 cups of water with the seasonings packet and the macaroni.  This is the first place you know this isn't HH; you have to make sure you cook the water (or ""most of it"" as the instructions say) off before you add the Velveeta.  Another difference is that the seasonings smell a little .... strong, and a little unusual, to put it mildly.  I wasn't too fond of the odor emanating from the skillet, and at this point I started to hope that I wasn't going to have to make something different for dinner.<br /><br />This also tastes different from HH.  Not bad -- in spite of my initial worry, the Velveeta Cheeseburger Skillets tastes quite good.  But it is rather different from HH, and if you're expecting HH you will probably be disappointed.  I can't quite put my finger on what the spice is, but there is a definite spice that makes this taste completely different from any cheeseburger macaroni that you've ever had before.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this will completely replace Hamburger Helper for me; I'll have to wait and see what other varieties they come out with before I make that decision.  But I do know that this is a good alternative, and for people who want something different, it will be a good choice.",3
B003VIN0QE,"I am no stranger to Pacific Foods or soup products in general.  I eat a lot of this manufacturer's items and I consume many varieties of soup.  Of late, Pacific Foods has been producing many new flavors of soups that lack attention to taste and consumer friendly packaging.  This rosemary potato chowder is one of these newer soups and it was a big disappointment for me.<br /><br />My dislike of this soup began with the packaging.  It is one of those fold and tear type of cartons where you pop the sides up and take a knife or pair of scissors and cut off the top to remove the contents.  These cartons are not consumer friendly.  It is difficult to remove the product without some of the contents spilling as you tear off the top.  Pacific has soup containers which come with a capped spout.  The capped spout on other containers allows the consumer to pour what they need and refrigerate the rest.  Alas, with this container, you need to pour all of the contents and put what you don't need into a tupperware dish -- thus creating more dirtied dishes in your life.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the appearance upon pouring.  I definitely eat food first with my eyes.  When I poured the soup into a bowl, there were giant curds intermingled with oily broth, carrots and celery.  This soup is made with milk so I am guessing that was what caused the curds.  I had to use a whisk to break them up.  After heating the soup, the base was still very oily.  See a photo of the soup in the product image gallery.<br /><br />The third disappointment was the taste and texture of the soup.  The soup is oily, filmy and I don't think it is thick enough to be called a chowder.  The manufacturer was very light on the use of rosemary.  I wouldn't call this a rosemary potato chowder.  I would call this flavored liquid with some finely diced potatoes and a dash of rosemary.<br /><br />The fourth disappointment was the nutritional profile.  This container has 2 one cup servings.  Each one cup serving has 230 calories, 8 grams of fat, 25% of your daily saturated fat (5 grams) and 30% of your daily sodium.  See a shot of the nutritional profile in the product image gallery.<br /><br />If you have the time, I would make your own potato soup.  Imagine Soup carries a large line of soup bases, including a potato flavor.  If you add potatoes, onion, carrots and some spices, you will have a soup that is much more texturally appealing, flavorful and nutritional (that soup base has 110 calories per cup).<br /><br />This product is vegetarian.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.",2

In recent years, I've learned that coffee will give me terrible stomach-aches accompanied by unpleasant headaches.

B003LTPY08,"My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past. We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book. I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.",4

The sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the Matcha itself, but it doesn't taste candy sweet, at least, not to me ... although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation.  But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.

The salsa is very watery - right away as you tip the jar back and forth, the salsa runs around very quickly and I was suspicious that it would not have enough chunky goodness that makes a salsa tasty. I was absolutely right. The salsa has a thin watered down flavor. There is a muted spiciness that is not worth spending money for. The fire-roasted detail was worthless - it just meant that you would see black flakes from the grilled vegetables swimming around in the watered down salsa.

B0027VO330,"I can't believe that this sauce is not better received in these reviews.  My wife and I love this sauce.  I find it SO much more authentic than Classico, Ragu, or similar generic sauces.  They use San Marzano tomatoes and fresh garlic.  I guess it's what you get used to.  This is not the typical schwag you get out of the bottle, but rather much more like something you would be served in a restaurant.  We buy it at Costco and get two bottles for around $7.  For a sauce of this quality, we find it to be a reasonable price.",4

This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results.",2

B004WM0ZTS,"While no instant coffee will ever taste as good as a freshly ground then brewed cup with filtered or spring water, this is as good as it gets otherwise.  While pricey, the packets are handy and convenient, the directions are easy (just add 8 oz of hot water and stir), and the taste is smooth.  I even got a bit of a caffeine buzz.  These instant blends are not as bold or strong as getting a regular cup of columbian or Italian roast at a Starbucks location, but still a very good cup on the go.  I really like this instant coffee and will continue to purchase them.",5

B000E7YPPK,"I am an avid eater of Thai Food, so I was curious to see how this Pad Thai in a box would taste. Considering the price, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Ease of cooking: 3 stars. It's a tough trick to gauge when the noodles have been soaked long enough to get the perfect firmness. Also, you have to use and wash multiple pots to make this. One pot to boil the water for the noodles. And a frying pan to stir fry the noodles in.<br /><br />Taste: It's in a box. How much can you expect? Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars. This is like the cup o noodle of Pad Thai. Decent enough to consume if you really run out of food, but not something you'll be craving during lunch hour.",3

B0090X8IPM,"This coffee is finely ground, so it has a good powdery consistency. Typically this means you'll need to use less of it for brewing. My wife and I like strong coffee, but this coffee is very strong, almost to the point that it's muddy.<br /><br />The coffee smells like vanilla, that's not an issue. However, I feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor. The coffee appears to be so darkly-roasted that you taste more coffee than vanilla. This coffee tastes better with milk added, which helps cut through the bitterness of the blend.<br /><br />The bag is typical packaging designed to keep the coffee fresh. Once opened, it can be folded down and sealed with an attached wire clip. The bag is imprinted with a bonus: take the empty bag to a Starbucks, and you get a free ""tall"" coffee.<br /><br />It's coffee, but not something I would enjoy on a regular basis. This may be a once-a-week blend for me. It's just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance.",2
B003OB2EP6,"This is ramen, a cheap, easy, and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap. Its got its pros and cons, but mostly its pretty alright. The chicken flavor is good. Some people find it too salty, I like it as is. The price here on Amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale, higher than others. Still, if you're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible, maybe paying a $1 more for 24 isn't such a big deal. Nutritionally its pretty meh. You could do a lot better. But its also a versatile base- you can always add lots of veggies, meat, other spices, pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option. We keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves.",3
B000E7YPPK,"To quote my 10 year old daughter when she dove into what she considers her favorite food. ""Mom this tastes like NOTHING.""<br /><br />This was abysmal. I thought we were taking a short cut. My mistake. Having made pad thai from scratch, I was shocked at how little it tasted like our favorite dish.<br /><br />The sauce had so much sugar in it, that out of the package it tasted more like sweet chilli sauce. As another reviewer said, there wasn't enough of it and the noodles in the finished dish tasted dry and bland... not good.  The only thing I could equate it to was trying to use ketchup as a substitute for Marinara sauce. We will never bother with that again.",1
B000FIXT2I,"...but I ding the overall score for the excess packaging. The bowls are in a cardboard box which is fine, but the cardboard box is placed in another cardboard box and the excess space is filled up with platic wrap. I understand why this is done, the manufancturer sends the rice boxed and Amazon boxes it again. All that aside, this is a good value and the rice is very good. Also convenient if you don't feel like using a rice cooker or stove top. These are a convenient, quick and nutrious way to get some quality carbs!",4

It's 20 calories per serving with 0 grams of fat. I gave the him the taste test and he said it's more gooey and less flavorful than normal white gravy. (maybe that's why they pump it with trans fat) I think it could taste a little closer to the original with spices or cream, I just haven't found the right combination yet",2
B0001ML880,"I brought some of this back from Costa Rica for myself and my family. I think it was probably the same price or a little more expensive in Costa Rica.

B002NHYQAS,"This chocolate is only 54% cocoa solids. Given that many of the better bittersweet or dark chocolates have 65-80% cocoa solids, that gives a lot of room for other ingredients, which in this case is sugar.  Although being organic, you get the high falutin sounding ""evaporated cane juice"", which is, of course, sugar.  Although the chocolate flavor is good, this bar is on the sweet side.  So if you are looking for something stronger or with a sharper edge, you should avoid this one.  However, if you have a sweet tooth, and want a good fruity chocolate flavor, this chocolate would be to your liking.",4

B004CYLW7A,"My teens loved it, my husband and I did not. The younger ones liked the extra crunchy peanut taste. Of course what they liked the most was the sweetness. My son felt it had more of a honey taste than sugary and I would agree. They commented that they would like it more as a snack out of the box then in cereal. They still felt that Honey Nut Cheerios was much better tasting with less aftertaste.<br />I thought I was eating caramel corn which I can only tolerate once in a great while and in small doses.  What I was hoping for was that Kellogg's would of listened to all the latest media hype about too much sugar. They didn't. This is way too sweet. I also wish they had used almonds or walnuts in this cereal. The protein to this cereal is only 2g per 3/4 cup. My teens may purchase this on their own but I will not be. I will continue to eat plain Cheerios, adding our own nuts to get some breakfast protein.",3

B000G7V3BM,"Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  ""Hot Buffalo Wing"" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones.",2

B000EM6PC6,"My family and I have been using this tea for over 40 years.  I make the best unsweetened tea I've ever had with this tea, and get many many compliments on it.  If you use good water, this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration, which changes it's flavor.  I am in South Texas and we take our tea very seriously down here.  This strong, brisk, hearty brew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon.  I haven't experienced stained teeth or other ill effects, either.  Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter.  It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend.  If you try it and it's too strong, tinker with your recipe.  Once you get the ratio right, you'll find it is delicious.",5
B0009YV5VU,"All the times I have had Tung Ting tea, from many different sources, the leaves have been a lovely green, yielding an infusion from pale yellow to gold with a deeply floral character, much more complex and mysterious than jasmine tea, although with tung ting it is the smell of the leaves themselves, no flowers. In fact this is the general characteristic of Formosan teas.<br /><br />Typically, the first infusion can be very sweet with the pronounced floral qualities presenting themselves more with each subsequent infusion.<br /><br />Well, sometimes you get what you pay for. This stuff appears to be quite old and of poor quality to start with. The leaves are dry and brown, not fresh looking and greenish. There was not expiration date and the box is not air tight, the bag inside is not sealed.<br /><br />The leaves have no fragrance at all, and the tea was brown with about 2% of the normal floral character or sweetness. Actually it tasted more like the very cheap oolong tea at the tiny tea houses in the outer Sunset district, S.F. where the tea is free with the $1 fried bread.<br /><br />I would spend just a little more from one of the reputable companies on Amazon like Tao of Tea, and get what you pay for.

Simply putting the coffees in a ziploc bag preserved their freshness and the idea that I was putting less plastic in our local landfill was great as I live in a little village on the Yukon River.<br /><br />However, I found this roast to have a very bitter aftertaste.  I generally enjoy a full, dark roast and I like the bitterness of coffee.  That's the whole point.  But I was really unhappy with the finish in this particular French Roast and won't purchase it again.  I am slowly working my way through the 80 count I bought, on days when I have a taste for added creamer flavors.

B001DH6AFI,"The clever name is instructive: conventional chocoLATE--""latte"" refers to dairy-based.  So, for those trying to avoid dairy, this company uses rice milk. What is rice milk? Any grain can be made into a substitute milk by cooking the grain with at least 5x the amount of water, which will yield a milk-like substance after cooking.<br /><br />Also, it is sweetened with unrefined cane, which has some of the nutrients lost when refined into white sugar.  While not as optimal a sweetener as stevia or agave, it is less deleterious.<br /><br />In the end, this ricechoco has a taste very close to good chocolate, will not cause the mucuous-like symptoms that dairy-sensitive people experience, and will cause less of a ""sugar-rush-then crash"" when consuming conventional chocolate bars.<br /><br />a.",3

I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it.

So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18"">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a ""small"" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies.",5

One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17-years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.

Each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child. Each tiny package contains a special treat- a tiny insect card which features a color photograph and interesting facts.  If you have a budding entomologist on your hands, these are the perfect treat!

When I bagan to pour out the conditioner, I instantly noticed how watery it was. As I applied it to my hair, it was just like putting water on it, it was runny and gave no slip as I tried to detangle my hair. Honestly, this is a cheap ineffective conditioner. There are more synthetics inside of this product than shea butter which is far down on the list of ingredients. You would do much better buying some V05 conditioner for $1. If you're looking for a hydrating conditioner that gives good slip for natural hair, try Herbal Essences Hello Hydration. It has silicones just like this one but provides much better results. After using both the shampoo and conditioner, I was left with lifeless, dull hair with a waxy film over it.",1

B008C2JCUW,"I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have thick, wavy black hair (which has been dyed brown in the past), and I thought this was an okay product to use. Even though it's not perfect, I would say my hair is better when I use this product than when I don't use this product.If your hair is naturally oily and rarely gets dry, you're fortunate enough not to need oils like these. But if your hair gets dry and perhaps frizzy once you're out of the shower, you should try this hair oil.<br /><br />I use this product 2 or 3 times a week. I massage it into my hair at least half an hour before I take a shower. It smells a little, and it's really up to you whether you find it a good or bad smell, but I personally don't like it. When I'm in the shower, I use small amounts of shampoo and conditioner (which is what you're supposed to do anyway) and wash out my hair with cold water. Then I let my hair air-dry or towel-dry and apply a leave-in conditioner of a different brand. And my hair feels good afterward! It's not dry nor oily, it doesn't look frizzy, and people have told me my hair is looking healthier over time.<br /><br />I basically don't like the smell of this product. And I'm sure there are much better, albeit more expensive, hair oil brands out there. But if you need to cure your hair of dryness, you should make your shower routine more like mine.",4

B004MO6NI8,"I was looking forward to trying NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK because I definitely could benefit from a daily energy drink, and this one was recommended by a friend. But I found it much too strong, and grimaced after the first sip.<br /><br />As a person who loves to eat lemons whole, I've never avoided strong, fruity flavors, but NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK has a pronounced pineapple taste (with a touch of grapefruit and grape), and pineapple in particular has never appealed to me.<br /><br />I had to force myself to drink half a can, which I discovered later, is 130 calories. The entire 160 ounce can is 260 calories, containing a whopping 66 grams of sugar. That's considerably more calories than I use up in a workout.<br /><br />On a positive note, an 8 ounce serving does fulfill 100% of the daily requirement for vitamins C, B6 and B12, and 10% for folic acid, zinc and selenium. It also contains soy, and traces of sodium and potassium.<br /><br />Additional elements in the drink are difficult to determine from the can, as the print on it is not only small - it is too thick to be readable. I was able to find out however that the primary ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and carbonated water. It also contains l-carnitine, which has definite health benefits (I take it daily for hyperthyroidism), as well as grape seed extract, targine and argine. It appears to have few preservatives.<br /><br />I did not notice any difference in my energy level the hour after drinking it. But five minutes afterwards, I experienced a bout of frequent burping.<br /><br />Personally, I would not drink NO FEAR ENERGY drink again. But taste is subjective, and people who like the flavor and do not mind all the calories might enjoy it. My inclination, however, is to stick with my favorite drink, glaceau vitamin water zero (acai blueberry or mixed berry) which is delicious, nutritious and calorie- free, and leaves me feeling clear-headed and motivated.",2

It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.

B008O3G25W,"The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.",2

B007M83302,"Low calorie, its true. Try other flavors not Salt & Vinegar.  Wish I could return them, but we ate 2.  Or at least tried to, yuck!",1
B003EM7J9Q,"For starters, I'm not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadn't ordered these.",1

B000EHKWDY,"I ordered the 6 pack of Shelton's Turkey Jerky.  With great anticipation, I opened the first package.  Much to my disappointment, the jerky was quite dry and brittle.  I was hoping for something more like Trader Joe's turkey jerky which is always moist and tasty.  I will eventually eat what I ordered, but unlike the Trader Joe's brand, this stuff will hang around until I'm desperate for anything to munch on.",2
B000E1BLV2,"Tastes good because, well, it's Velveeta.  But if you're buying it for the broccoli, don't bother.  The tsp of dried broccoli included in the package hardly makes it ""with broccoli"".",2

B0007ZLRUU,"While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.<br /><br />In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed.",1
B005O8BLLU,"My baby loves this. It's a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids. The pouch makes it easy to get the product out, without making a mess and the lid is easy to refasten, so you can use it again over a few feeds.",5
B00020HHRW,"A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.",4
B001LGGH40,"I really like the Switch drinks so far, 100 percent juice with a carbonation too, it is a nice combo for us soda loving consumers.  I think too that the carbonation prevents me from sucking down a can this size in one gulp. I like it so much I ordered, and I am halfway through a case of the black cherry flavor.  With free shipping in a combo order, the price of these drinks is pretty good.<br /><br />Kiwi Strawberry, it sounded like a weird combination mixing fruits I don't normally expect in a cocktail together.  Still it works, strawberry and kiwi seem to be very complimentary fruits, and I may eventually have to try a case of these, (the one can sample from the vine program is just not enough when the item is sold in cases).",4
B00196497O,I purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve. The Omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain. I have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait.,5

B003V33YU6,Was disappointed as I have been trying to find a reliably good 5 pound bag of ground coffee. Honestly the quality seems similar to no-name canned grocery store ground coffee. I'll keep looking.,2
B008O3G25W,"I have my Min-Pin boarded at the home of a friend who has what looks like a Westie. I took the bottle of ""Lickety Stik"" over when I went to pick up my dog. Offered it to both dogs. The westie loved it, however my Min-Pin would have nothing to do with it. Maybe that's because another dog licked it, however that's doubtful as most dog I've met aren't that fussy. Its kind of a cool idea but I think a dog biscuit works just as well. One other caveat, it looks like the same bottle that roll-on deodorant comes in so make sure you know for sure what you're smearing on your arm-pits or you could attract some unwanted attention",3
B0047RQ9M0,"I switched to Green Mountain Breakfast Blend after not being able to get Black Tiger as a super saver item.  It was a real disappointment.  Very weak and certainly not something I would want as ""breakfast blend""..",2
B002IEZJMA,There is a nice strong coffee flavor and the right amount of sweetness to the drink but the additives leave an acidic aftertaste that is a little off-putting.  Maybe a little cream or vanilla flavoring could help?,3
B000EHL21U,"If you have TMJ, steer far away from this. It's inedible. Never mind the taste, which is completely bland and somewhat chalky, but this is very, VERY tough to chew for someone with TMJ issues. I made the mistake of looking at the picture and spotting ""nougat,"" which really shouldn't be *that* chewy. I mean, if I can handle a room-temperature Clif bar...<br /><br />Maybe I'll microwave the ones left in the box to make them edible.",1
B001CD1VI4,"I eat a cookie every morning for breakfast, different kinds. I don't get hungry until later in the afternoon. I have lost 7 pounds in the last month because I'm not overeating trash all day.

B007M83302,"I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, ""potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)"".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.",2
B0030VBRIU,"My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby brain development. I tried to put butter or some seasoning to cover the fishy taste, but my son still does not want to eat it. He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.",2
B000EM6PC6,"Lipton loose leaf tea beats any other tea I've tried, hands down. When the local groceries stopped stocking Lipton's Loose Leaf Tea. I assumed Lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable, and people found it easier to use tea bags. WRONG, we've been sold on the idea of convenience, and taste took the back seat. This tea is packaged in a foil lined package, is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty. Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.<br />This is how I brew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon. If you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments. Once you figure it out. It becomes routine, and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make!<br />ENJOY!!<br /><br />PS I keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock, after I've opened the box.",5
B006H34CUS,"I received a Banana Soft Baked Bar through Influenster. I was pleasantly surprised how yummy this was. It really tasted like banana nut bread.

If anyone knows where I can find them (LA area), please comment below and let me know =)",4
B001CPUPMA,I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.,1

That wouldn't be a big deal- but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.<br /><br />This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over.",3
B006N3IG4K,"This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger.  We loved it and it has become our favorite.  If you want some coffee to ""caffeine you up"", this is the one for you!!  Also, Wolfgang Puck's Breakfast in Bed is great...not so strong!",5

It does fill the room and it'll waft into your bedroom all night if you grind and prepare it on a timer the night before. I know, you may think it a sin to grind early, but that convenience doesn't curtail your pleasure with Weaver's.  The taste! It's delightfully rich and full.  I can't YET speak for consistency.",5

I've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.  It has lemon juice in it, but apparently far far too much.

B003ZXCEYE,"i paid $15 for 36 bags of snacks- so i figure .41cents a bag is a good price to have portion control and way less expensive than vending machines. it does cost twice as much money than buying the big boxes- but i don't have to worry about eating too much once i open the larger boxes- and i don't have to worry about them going stale.<br />-the 'use by' date is FEB 2013, so plenty of shelf life-<br />-the cheddar/jack variety is nice and sharp- prefer that flavor. the white cheddar is a nice change of pace- and the regular variety are the same as always.<br />-none of them were crushed and all the bags/boxes arrived in pristine condition",4
B000GFYRI0,"If you think mud is an exotic flavor, then this is the tea for you. Otherwise, you might want to think twice. This tea smelled wonderful while brewing, but in the cup the taste is muted and muddled. There is some kind of spice there--I know because 1) it says so on the package and 2) I can feel the bite of something on my tongue, but I can't place what the spice is and it's aroma is barely discernible during drinking. It's like a mouthful of flat, flavorless... I don't know what. It was unbearable without sugar, and it didn't improve with it. I didn't add milk because I didn't want to waste milk. Take a pass on this one.",1
B00064VQO4,"I discovered Bariani at my CSA during the 90s and remember it as a superior and tasty product.  So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!!  This oil has a BITTER finish.  Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable!  Has the production changed?  Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation?  First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.<br /><br />I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself.",3
B000LKZDTW,"Earlier this year, the FDA enacted a new rule forcing companies to take the gluten-free label from anything that has more than 20 ppm gluten.  (I'm looking at you, Arrowhead Mills and Bob's Red Mill.)<br /><br />However, you can be right at 20 ppm, which makes a lot of celiacs sick, and still label yourself, ""gluten free"".  (The rule should have said, ""less than 20 ppm"", not ""20 ppm or less"".)<br /><br />This is where Amazon is fantastic--they made the company list the gluten in this, so we know it's NOT gluten free.  (I have yet to find a Hain's food product that was actually gluten free, although some of them are legally gluten free.  Look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid, even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf.)<br /><br />Pacific Rice Milk and Whole Foods' store brands of rice milk are gluten free, though.  Buy those instead.",2
B004391DK0,"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option.",2
B000CQ6KSI,"No long, frightening lists of chemical additives, either. Nice to find something quick and easy that I don't have to feel guilty giving my kids from time to time.

B0017SWAAW,Not sure what the other reviewers are doing differently than I am but it doesn't taste anything like cheese at all!,1
B000YPKODY,I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.,1
B008FHUDW0,"The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.  We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.  I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.",3
B004IREFUM,Reminds me of weak diner coffee - has a slightly off flavor.  Not at all pleasant.  Donut Shop and Barista House Blend are coffees of choice in our home.,2
B0007A0AQW,"I thought these looked perfect for training so I gave them a try.  The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable.  We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days.  We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone.  If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands.  Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again.  I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor.",1
B001PUHFF2,"This plant type is easily stressed and it was stressed when I received it. After a few weeks, It is doing fine.

Doesn't need much water and love sunshine what a good plant.",3
B002TMV34E,"The coffee was mellow with a little bite to the finish. Compares favorably to most coffees out there with just a tad more harshness. I found the packaging ridiculously difficult to open - finally taking a scissors to it. The description says ""Pack of 3"" but I only received 1. Overall a good coffee.",4
B000LRIJC8,Its  hard to find this Gyro Meat loaf. Once I found it I was instanly hungry for a Gyro Sandwich. I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!! Wow shipping was a little high. I figured it was due to the special shipping of meat. I think it took a little long and was not  to pleased with the shipping time. Over all the meat was great and I got my Gyro sandwich just  let down on the shipping.,3
B0002MLA5K,"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.",3

B0018KR8V0,"When I first opened the individual package I was a bit grossed out honestly. It looked like a candybar-shaped turd.<br /><br />But then I ate it, and the texture wasn't that great either so I was still grossed out with the image of the turd, but kept eating it. To my great relief it tasted really nice. There is a lot of flavor for how few of ingredients there are.<br /><br />Also, I really liked the minimalistic ingredient list. My advice, just don't look at it when you eat it.",3
B002DLXXHG,"While I read here the original flavor was natural, there was no list of ingredients available. And to my disappointment when this arrived it does indeed contain nitrites. The taste is alright, but I really would like to find jerky WITHOUT Nitrites or Nitrates. I've kept it in the fridge now for several months (i haven't had any mold issues) since I truly try to consume nitrites as little as possible, it will take a very long time to eat this or I'll end up trashing it.

B000KV61FC,"My puppy loves this toy, although I don't like that the rope gets smelly and it is hard to clean (I prefer toys that can go in the washer or dishwasher).  I put her kibble in it and she immediately hauls it into her crate she she can get the food out without having to chase it around the house.  She is not a toy chewer, but this has cracked just from her dropping it a few inches.  I have glued it several times, but the last time was so bad that the glue has now made it so I can't screw the bottom on.  This has lasted 1 month with a very gently now 5 month old Newfoundland. Not a great track record, but she loves it so much that I will order another. Thank God for Amazon Prime where I can get another one quickly as she looks disappointed when I put her food in her dish rather than this device.",4

B006DK1Y4W,"Authentic mojito taste this product does not make. It is very tasty nonetheless.  As someone who grows his own mint leaves and fancies himself a mojito connoisseur, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this product.  Its very existence demonstrates how the parent of Crystal Light, Kraft, invests in product innovation.  In fact, it is somewhat interesting how boring companies like Kraft and P&G can invent new products to entice consumers to spend their money - even on products that have no caloric or nutritional value.  That being said, I encourage Kraft to craft more mojito-flavored products.  In fact, I would even volunteer to be a beta tester.",4

B0035YE9CS,I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed.  It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands.  I've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra.  Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good!,5
B001RVFDOO,I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross.

But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!,2

There is a strange saltiness in the taste and the passion fruit and orange peel are barely perceivable.<br /><br />Amazon was kind enough to refund me the cost of this order. Lesson to be learned: try to find a sample of a product before you buy a case of it.,1

I have a difficult time breaking them apart even when they are meant to be broken apart. Each cookie is a sectioned two piece. It's impossible to break them apart further by hand.<br /><br />The JR mix finally succeeded in breaking down the cookie with his teeth. The Shih Tzu couldn't do it, no matter how hard he tried. Frankly, I worry he could break a tooth on these things.<br /><br />The ingredients look good (and they smell good), though I'm a little concerned about the palm oil--is it as bad for dogs as it is for humans?<br /><br />Even though the dogs seem to like them (I used a mallet to give small pieces to the Shih Tzu), I can't see buying them again.

B00139C3P2,"I really cannot give this product a bad review.  My cat would not eat it, so I gave it to someone else and their cat loved it.<br />My cat is an adopted stray that was eating the birds in my yard. I started feeding him Purina Cat Chow in a dish on my breeze-way. Ordered the Newman's so he would get more protein. He just didn't go for it.",3
B000P49A0W,"The ChocoPerfection ""Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bars"" are indeed good tasting, but did cause me to experience some fairly spectacular ""gastric distress"". I bought a box of these when they came up on Woot and was excited about getting a Maltitol free, diabetic friendly chocolate bar with only 2 net carbs.<br /><br />While I knew that Maltitol caused me gastric issues, I thought these would be safe since Erythritol is OK for me and ate one before heading out of the house. Sadly I suspect the Oligofructose brought on a very unpleasant reaction that was more than a little embarrassing since it occurred at very public event. Further tests in privacy of my home confirmed that these bars were the cause of the unpleasantness.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor and low-carb count, but make sure you know if they will ""effect"" you before heading out to enclosed places with a lot of people. Ironically, my non-diabetic son doesn't have a reaction to these and enjoys the taste so at least they won't go to waste.<br /><br />CFH",3
B0076ZJ21K,It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. It's good....if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need.,5
B0041NYV8E,"The full strength taste of this ginger/lemon drink is too strong for my taste, but diluting it by using half as much of the powder just means it makes twice as many servings. It would be great for a queasy stomach; these days I'm using it to mitigate my hay-fever induced congestion and itchy throat.",4
B000RUF8GY,"Bought a house where the yard has been neglect for 6-10yrs. The weeds dominate the back yard and it's not your typical dandilion. These are the tough ones with the thicker stems. Trying to save money and hard labor I bought two of these, more then required for the area I was testing them on and soaked it down. Took quite a bit of time but I thought for sure it would work. Unfortunately not a change. I can't give a review for people dealing with regular weeds they get in their lawn but if you barely have a lawn because of weeds then this will not work for you. Sorry to say that.",1
B007XJU94S,"The beans smell like a low quality smoldering cigar. Like the beans have been burnt. Coffee tastes equally horrible. My guess is they really screwed up the roasting process and are just trying to recover some of their cost. So if you're excited to see ""gourmet"" beans for so cheap, don't be, all you'll do is make your coffee grinder smell horrible for a month.",1
B0029NUYZW,This is great for smaller dogs or dogs with poor dentition and trouble chewing. Very small pieces so easy to ingest.<br />My dogs like traditional product slightly more.,4
B001EQ5F9K,"It tastes good and I like it. But too much sugar!! Excessive sugar makes it attractive, but I doubt it's good for health. Literally, I can find a layer of sugar at the bottom of the bowl....... For the sake of health, I'll give it up.",2
B001GB7IJI,I love Swedish Fish but was horrified when I received a bag of deceased fish!  The bag was torn open in the box.  Some were hard as rocks.  Others had melted into a bloody red mess.  What are you made of that you can house both extremes in one bag?  I'll never eat one again.  I've switched to blue gummy sharks.,1
B006Q7YFLQ,"I got these thinking they were cat treats, but I guess they are for both dogs and cats, which is a good thing, because my cat did not like them at all.<br /><br />They are kind of big for a cat, so I broke it up into smaller pieces, but my cat just took a few sniffs and walked passed it. So then I gave one to my dog. If he loves something, he will eat it immediately, barely taking time to chew it. If he does not like something he will go bury it and never bother eating it. If it's questionable, he plays with it for a few minutes, then either eats it or buries it. For this treat, he played with it for a few minutes. He did his little puppy dance, bum up in the air, then poking his head at the treat a few times. Totally funny to watch. Then he decided to eat it. So I'd say it's not his favorite, but he decided they aren't bad.",4
B004YV80OE,"I fixed this for my husband and I a few nights ago. The taste was pretty good to start with, but the more I ate it the less I wanted to. After a few bites it got pretty bland, and a bit gummy. Because it is a type of mac and cheese, I think the grandkids would like it however I won't be fixing it for us anymore. I put the leftovers in the refrigerator, but did not even want to warm them up for lunch or a snack. I would not purchase this item.",2
B004JRKEH4,Tasted kind of like old Ranch dressing.  Boring and fairly unoffensive.  Unmemorable.  Creamy? Yes. Bold? Not so much.<br /><br />I'm not really sure where this item fits into your condiment selections.  Salad dressing? Not really.  Salsa? No.  On tacos?  Maybe soft tacos...?  Creamy tacos?  That doesn't really fit either.  Might do alright on a hamburger.  I wasn't able to try that out before the item expired.  Not spicy enough to replace salsa or tabasco.  I can't recommend this.,2
B000G0EP78,This item does make fairly good baked goods but not worth the high price in my opinion.  Does not compare with regular baking four at all though.,3
B001EO5XVM,"I ordered this pasta, thinking it was gluten-free, as it came up in the gluten-free search on Amazon.  My fault, I guess, because I didn't look at it closely enough.  I am just irritated with both myself and the company as it was not inexpensive.  Of course, I have not tried it since I have celiac disease, but I am sure the rest of my family will enjoy it as per the other reviews I read before I purchased it.  If I had read further down the review list, I would have seen the review by the person who did the same thing as I did.",1
B000FRS9NI,"This product works well for the dog who runs away whenever the daily pills show up.  I lie and tell her that this is a chocolate ball and when she remembers it isn't, I tell her it is a liver ball and that gets her every time.  I like this as much as the pouches now on the market.  The product is worth the price, but care is necessary so that the pill is covered and doesn't become uncovered in the process.  My dog is smart, though not all that smart, and needs to take several pills daily to keep from being in pain, to control her thyroid.  Youth is in the mind of the beholder, and with aids like this even my 11 year od Old English Sheepdog behaves like a puppy.",4

B000YSTH16,"My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix.",2
B0000GHNT0,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for.  It is overpoweringly hot--with a searing heat--and has an odd, unenjoyable flavor.  Although not a terrible hot sauce--I consumed the entire bottle--El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried, but it just is not my thing.",2
B005MGDP86,"I like the fact that this salt is fine. However, I needed a salt shaker with larger holes as it tends to clog, even though I have a few grains of rice in the bottom which usually helps with that problem.<br />Overall, it's good and only a small amount is needed.",4
B007OXJK3Y,"I purchased this because it sounded so good. We love the Donut House decaf (and my husband would not drink and decaf before we found this brand). I was hoping this would be as yummy as it sounds, even tho I had read many negative reviews. I am really not that picky. I love most coffee, especially flavored unless it is very ""fake"" tasting flavor. Save your money on this one. Unfortunately, this is pretty awful tasting, even after I tried to ""doctor"" it up with syrup and cream. The nicest thing I can say about it is it smells good while brewing.",2
B001LG945O,"This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.<br /><br />The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.<br /><br />Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.<br /><br />Not bad, but not what I want.",3
B003QNJYXM,"I tried a bottle today and it was a waste of money. I drank the whole bottle and it tasted very gross, I almost gagged on the aftertase even though I chased it with water. Felt a tiny energy boost but less than normal from coffee. There was a ""crash."" Slight but still, they advertise that there isn't one.",1
B001EPPBXG,I ordered 8 cans of the wheat and honey 400g CERELAC but got 8 cans of the NESTUM 300g cans. The diiference in sizes wont have been as much of an issue as the difference in taste and consistency.<br /><br />Do not order from this seller. The product shown is NOT what u will recieve.,2
B001P76XAS,"I'm a huge fan of Pop Secret's Homestyle popcorn! Unlike other buttery popcorns, this one doesn't leave that lovely greasy coating in my mouth. Uh, ewwww. It's a great mix of salt and buttery goodness. My only wish is that it were lower in fat, but oh well, it's so yummy I'll put up with it. :-)",4
B001HTJ2BQ,"I purchased a case of 12 cans. Out of those 12 cans, only four appear to be undented. EIGHT out of 12 are badly dented. The BOX they are packed in is fine so they had to have been dented when they were packed into the box. This is unacceptable quality control. I gave this 2 stars because of this problem from the seller but I don't know yet what to think of the coconut milk itself as I have not yet opened one of the four seemingly undented cans. Some posters here have said the cans are BPA free but the cans don't look high enough quality to be BPA free. Eden Foods use BPA free cans and their cans LOOK high quality. I hope it is true of the Native Forest coconut milk cans but I'm not sure of that. The number of dented cans in an undamaged box is definitely a big disappointment.",2
B003VXFK44,This is our first time trying the Wolfgang Puck coffee - so glad we did!!!  It is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day!  I would buy it again!,5
B000LKVDO6,"I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce.  If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste.  I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less.",1
B001D0KG4Q,"The box contains a true cross-section of coffee types, from flavored types to darkest roast. The Rainforest Espresso was a favorite dark roast, and the Columbian Dorado was the ideal medium roaster (IMO). Others in my family have different tastes though, so your mileage may vary as well.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the heavy presence of teas included here, raised the cost-per-cup significantly. Nobody in our home likes hot teas, and although I did get one good iced-tea conversion, the effort expended removes convenience from the picture.<br /><br />Bottom line: Timothy, you need a coffee-only variety pack!! Maybe one with some more varieties in addition to the coffees already there. I would then rate the score upward to a 5. As it is, the ever-present frustration of seeing those darned teas in there, takes some of the fun out of deciding which K-Cup to brew next.<br /><br />Just a closing thought - Big Cat Coffees offers a build-your-own box of five selections (including Timothy's), which IS very useful, but not much different in price.",3
B000EVT04M,"These are a little disappointing.  The cherry flavor is nowhere near as strong as in the standard Haribo Gummibear which I subscribe to on a regular basis.  The aroma is stronger than the taste.  These feel harder, too, and are huge in the mouth to begin with.  The cherries in the bag just sort of stick together like one big ball of red and green rubber.  Bummer.  Hate to see what these look like in the summertime.<br /><br />I'm sucking on one right now and it feels like a bland rubber blob is in my mouth.  You can't be inconspicuous eating one of these!  I won't be getting these again.",3
B001D8PJLI,"but it isn't very flavorful.  a friend suggested it and i jumped on it when amazon got it back in stock.  i do like that it is made with vegetable products but i won't buy it again.  shoot, i have enough for the next ten years!",2

B000J2JKGO,"I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats.",1
B000M15XPY,"This was the worst order I've ever experienced. The Trolli Gummy Bears sent were not from Trolli. They were some other brand, and they were disgusting! Truly awful. Do not order from Bayside Candy. They will sell you a false product.",1
B002BCE9JS,"I enjoyed this soup. Yes we would all like fresh Pho soup. If you are in the area that we live you will not find a Vietnamese restaurant for 100 miles. I made the soup and added fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro, fresh green onions and strips of cooked steak. This is a basic soup for you to add things to it....not to expect when you open it strips of steak are going to appear from the box. I recommend this soup as a starter to a great soup by adding fresh ingredients. Fresh things never let you down.",4
B000CRHQN0,"These bars are a great alternative to typical protein bars. They are not full of sugar and carbs like most other types. They taste good and are filling. One bar was not enough for a full meal for me, but with a piece of fruit or a small salad or something, it's great.",4
B0006JKCZ8,"I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!",1
B004CYLW7A,"It smells like reeses pieces peanut butter cups out of the box. The cereal is a bit larger than cheerios and more airy/puffy, felt like a kid's cereal. Being airy, it made it more rough and it scratched the roof of my mouth when I ate it. I didn't think it was that sweet. Compared to Frosted Flakes it wasn't that sweet. It didn't have anything really special or unique about it. It turned the milk a bit of a light brown color when I was finished with it.<br /><br />The nuts were hardly noticeable, especially since they are so huge on the package. It was crunchy. Didn't really get a nutty flavor when eating it just when smelling it. After one bowl I felt like I could have another.<br /><br />The box was easy to open, and so was the plastic bag the cereal was in.",4
B00653KJ5M,"I bought a 40 sampler pack from the caveman bakery website. It's not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie I like. They kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars, like kind or something. Of the ones I've tried, Alpine and Tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it. The least favorite that I've tried is either the rainforest, it has a strong taste of ginger and I'm not a fan of ginger. The other ones are pretty good too. However, I didn't realize that these cookies were so small, but I guess based on the big portions of today's society, this is a normal portion.<br /><br />Overall its good, would I buy again? Maybe if I was on a strict gluten-free diet.",4
B008ZRKZSM,"I ordered this with tongue in cheek.  I really expected it to taste powdery and be a poor substitute for ""real"" PB.  My goal was to try it in smoothies.<br /><br />Sometimes it's good to be wrong.  I use it for PB and banana smoothies every morning.  Wow!  I cannot believe how good it is!  Not powdery or chalky tasting, yummy enough to eat right out of the jar. . . almost.<br /><br />I looked at the website for other ways to use it and found more recipes than I expected and they cover all meals and types of foods.  One day soon I'll try using it to make phad thai or PB cookies...maybe both.<br /><br />[...]",4
B000IHNCQO,"I love that the snacks are good in protein, low carbohydrates, but the amount of sodium is too much.  I hope my letter to the company will help them develop a low sodium product.

If you are not concerned about the sodium content, then this is the snack to eat.",3
B000E21Z7Q,"I try to follow a somewhat low carb diet and find that these pretzels fit the bill as far as satisfying my need for a carby crunch.  I really enjoy all of Kay's chips and pretzels but keep in mind that, of course, there will be textural and taste differences from the ""real"" thing.",5
B003CL6Q84,"I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.",3
B001CWV4PA,"These are the best glutin free ritz-like crackers...but that's not exactly a praise.  The cheese are not not bad, but the plain ones taste like egg.  A lot of gluten-free breads and crackers use egg as the lacking ""glue""...and you can always taste it.  Yuck! All of that being said, the plain ones are ok when made into peanut butter sandwiches and all of the crackers are pretty good with a dip or chicken/tuna salad...sigh.",3
B000FAMUQW,"The product is good--I have had three orders so far. The problem is with the manufacturer's credibility. One box was much lighter when I picked it up even though it was closed when I examined it. It was about 200g  instead of 500g with sugar cubes freely moving on a bottom of the box. I have no idea what happened and it is impossible to report it to Amazon--missing links, circular instruction, no phone numbers, no customer support links. The buttons on most pages, even on Returns page are ""Continue Shopping"".",2

B00113XJQW,"When I got my dog I did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients. There are high quality dog foods like this one out there, but you probably won't find them in regular supermarkets. While this food may be more expensive than other dog foods, it is well worth it. Innova Evo is one of the foods that were NOT affected by the recall. Also, the ingredients are healthier, and don't have high wheat/grain content or nasty additives.<br /><br />My Doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems. Also her poop was really mushy, almost diarrhea. When I finally switched her to Innova Evo Red Meat I'd wished I'd done it sooner. She doesn't need to eat quite as much, and her coat is beautiful!

B000UXS9X2,"Great tasty product and great price, but Roland has a packaging problem with the pail which had cracked and seemed too weak for the contents.<br /><br />The top of the pail was completely snapped off and the protective foil seal burst open during transit - the entire glaze contents spilled out like slime - Fed-X wrapped the box in a plastic bag to prevent further leakage. There was adequate bubble wrap from Amazon, but the box they used for shipping was too big and the pail had room to smash around inside the box. So, this is an EXCELLENT product, but Roland's plastic pail is just too thin.  Amazon is looking into the issue - I sure hope they resolve it!  And then I'll gladly order again.  By the way, Amazon's customer service Rocks - they are the best company to deal with when things go kapooey!<br /><br />** UPDATE: Ordered another one a few months later and it arrived in perfect condition with much better packaging.

The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not ""loose"" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.

B003YKAT68,"I used to love this product. I have purchased at least 10 cases over the last year or two. I am less impressed with the quality now and even a little concerned. Hopefully the manufacturer will read this review and be motivated to fix the problem. If not, I will continue to buy the Farmer's Market pumpkin from Target as it is made the right way and costs less.<br /><br />I manage a holistic rescue and boarding sanctuary. If you've ever been in pet rescue/boarding or taken a dog swimming at the beach, you know it is essential to have something that will stop diarrhea quickly. All canned/powdered pumpkin will stop diarrhea caused by saltwater ingestion or diet changes. This product works as well as any but now that this manufacturer is using pumpkins which aren't ripe, the product is less nutritious and harder to feed. Instead of a creamy consistency that will coat kibble, it is now thick and doesn't mix in well. Sometimes it's harder than others but I am notcing an overall trend of less-desirable product. Maybe Amazon is getting the reject product from the manufacturer and not explaining this to the consumer. The Nummy Tum Tum 100% Organic Pumpkin Puree should not be trusted to provide the vitamins that are in regular canned pumpkin. Only a product that is deep orange and mushy is made from ripe pumpkins and will provide the nutrients which are assumed to be in ""pumpkin"". Don't be fooled by yellow, firm pumpkin, it's not ripe.<br /><br />Lastly I want to add that two of my cases have contained badly dented cans that were dented prior to being packed in the box. That is just plain rude.",2

I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other ""flavors"" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like ""beef jerky"" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon's prices and delivery can't be beat.",5
B004BRYVJY,"I tried the Classic baked fries with kethcup.  Had I read the ingredients first I would never have bought them.  They are made from potato flakes like pringles and I have never liked Pringles.  These tasted odd to me and we had a houseful of company and a bunch of children under age 6 and no one liked them.  I crushed them up and put them under the bird feeder and only the chipmunks would eat them.  Nothing wholesome or good about these.  Back to my delicious Cape Cod potato chips, I will never wander away from you again!",2

B004XMIRU6,"I have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors, and I can say that this one is a very special coffee. I made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags I've bought. The coffee lost it's freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old, dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag. I wasn't sure what was the problem, cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic. The freshness, texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana. I was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee. Immediately I knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee.<br /><br />I've tried different regional coffees including, papa new guinea, Kenya AA, Sumatra beans, Jamaican blue mountain ... and others. I have to say that Kona is my favorite by far. The shipping bag comes oxygen free when it's being shipped from the vendor. The air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it. Sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping. I guess that's what happened to one of the bags. As you know, coffee and oxygen don't go well together, cause once the coffee is oxidized; it starts losing its freshness and it doesn't taste the way it's supposed to taste.<br /><br />I've made a recent purchase again and I'm very happy with the results. Give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment. You have got nothing to lose. Well done Hawaii Roasters. You guys have outdone yourselves.",5

It turns milk into a greenish cast and no matter how you mix it, it is a bit gritty but it does taste good.  I think its worth it for the benefits but when it comes to young ones, the way it looks matters the most.  It might just be my son but he totally thinks greenish milk is not cool (maybe because he associates it with veggies that he doesn't like).  I will still purchase it in the future because the positives out way any negatives.",3

B006BXUYN8,"I'm a peanut butter fan, I also like chocolate and have eaten the occasional granola bar at times. So, I jumped at a chance to give these bars a try.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed is, there are only 5 bars in a box. A curious number. I mean, they could have certainly fit a 6th one into the box. Second thing I noticed is these bars are small. I know they're not intended as a meal, or anything, but honestly 4 bites and it's gone type of small.<br /><br />Third thing, I couldn't taste the peanut butter and there was only a hint of chocolate for me. Just overall bland. Not gross type bland, just very little flavor.<br /><br />Based on Amazon's way of shipping groceries you purchase a 6 pack of boxes. 5 bars per box, equals 30 bars. I'm not sure the price, size, and taste would have me paying that much for the end value.<br /><br />They are alright, but there are so many other options out there already for bars of this type. This is not one I can see myself purchasing anytime in the future.",3
B003QNJYXM,"Like everything, some things work for some and some things don't. For a while it seemed to help me pretty quickly with the alertness, waking me up, and energy. I bought a few boxes and over the period of about 3 months used them on and off. To me they lost their effect quite quickly. I am not sure whether I got used them, whether it was in my head and never really worked (don't think this is the case), or whether they just stopped working...in my head. In the end I decided if it wasn't working for whatever reason, then why put it in my body.<br />  One last thing, I bought this flavor due to the lower price, but in my opinion the grape is much better tasting and not as bitter as this one.",2

B002IEZJMA,"I'm a big fan of coffee, so this beverage piqued my interest.  I have tried Starbucks drinks both at Starbucks coffee shops and from the supermarket.  I like them.  This drink is not as sweet.  It seems there's just enough sugar to take the bitter edge off.  When ice is added it makes a refreshing enough warm weather beverage, though I have tasted better.  What the product has going for it is convenience.  The 6.8-ounce cans are easy to store in the refrigerator and can be taken out and drunk quickly.  No process of first making iced coffee.  That's a definite plus.  It is not as satisfying at room temperature.<br /><br />The flavor, apart from being strong, is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a Starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can/bottle do.  As a pick-me-up, the drink is appropriate, since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy.  Compared to other similar drinks on the market, sugar content is low (which accounts for its bitterness).<br /><br />For those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee, this beverage is a no-no.  These days, many folks have cut down on caffeine intake, so this product might be counterproductive to weaning oneself from addictive caffeine.",2

B004YV80OE,"I LOVE Velveta but stopped eating 9 years ago when we switched to a healthy diet.  My kids, especially one of them in particular, loves mac n cheese, and that same mac n cheese addict also loves broccoli, so I thought this was a no brainer.  My husband and I liked the flavor, but the kids hated it.  I was expecting basically Velveta shells and cheese with broccoli and chicken and instead was flavored with chicken broth and less a mac n cheese than something else I guess.  This is most likely why the kids did not like it.  The ""pasta"" was small little rice sized/shaped pasta, forget what it is called, but I prefer larger pasta than that.  The broccoli was non-existent, it was a tiny packet of freeze dried broccoli ""florets"" that only added little green flecks to the meal, poorly done Kraft.  This product is high in sodium and calories and has many ingredients with hidden MSG in them (anything hydrolyzed or autolyzed and anythign that says ""protein extract"" or yeast extract) and it does not give anyone any vegetables.  Honestly a person is better off cooking from chicken and broccoli and adding it to Velveta shells and cheese.",3

B0018CJJ9W,"I have a 6yr old Pit.  She has been dealing with itchy allergies for the past few years, where she will bite her paws and scratch her belly until it is raw and inflamed.  The only thing that helped is the steroid shot from the vet, and also pill steroids, but we did not want to keep her on these every 3-4 months to control the outbreaks.  The vet said to try switching her food, and after some research I chose this product.<br /><br />At first, she loved the food, probably because it was different.  After a couple days, however, it did not settle well with her and she did have a couple accidents.  She did not seem to like the food after this, but we stuck with it and she has not had any accidents and eats it fine.  After about three weeks her paws have healed and itchies are gone.  I hate that it is so expensive, but it is cheaper than taking her to the vet every 3-4 months for medication and it is nice she is not stinky and miserable anymore.  1 bag has lasted about a month for our 80lb dog.  I would recommend trying it, but be careful about the dog getting used to it first--I probably should have mixed 1/2 new and 1/2 old and made the transition gradually.",4

B0041NYV8E,"I love strong Ginger flavors but I recognice that most people will find this drink, intended to ve served hot, as a very strong Ginger experience & possibly too strong.  I only got one sachet tio try which wasn't really enough to judge the product by conpletely but I could easily see myself consuming this as a hot beverage during times when I didn't feel well or was queasy from the long baot ride back from Catalina.  The Ginger is bracingly strong when hot but lightly sweetened.  It reminded me a bit of the Trader Joe's Lemon Echinacea drink I mix with my Iced tea so I waited for it to cool down and mixed it  with 2 parts Iced tea and 1 part of the reminder of the sachet and allowed to cool.  Nowe THAT worked for me.  It has a strong Ginger aroma and adds a nice ZING to my iced tea.<br /><br />I'd like to have some of this on hand for when I next get the cold or flu because strong Ginger drinks do settle my stomach and sooth my congestion.  I just wish I had a few more servings to try in several ways so I could give this a proper review.<br /><br />I would say, if you liked the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TPKAN4"">Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies, 6.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, which are SUPER GINGER SNAPS, then you will probably enjoy this as both a hot drink and a either an iced drink by itself or mixed with your tea od choice.

B0013NUGDE,"I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked.",4

Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings.

Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",5

B001RVFDOO,"If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Suprisingly, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer. Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! This is a really nice product.",4
B006N3I69A,"I was very disappointed with this purchase, it is not fresh coffee, like I expected. It looks, smells, and tastes just like Folgers instant freeze dried crystals!!<br />If you like freeze-dried instant coffee, then this is for you, but I got my Keurig machine because I like real, fresh coffee and this just doesn't do it for me.",2
B004SRH2B6,"I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.",3
B003X7S45U,"I love a good cup of flavored coffee, but hesitate trying new flavors.  It's not because I don't want to do so, but because if I don't like a coffee I am too frugal to dispose of it.  However, since I love Magnum Coffee Roaster's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee, I decided to give their Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie Coffee a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this flavored coffee.  The coffee is a nice medium roast.  It is smooth and leaves no acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I could not distinguish any vanilla flavor or any nut-like flavor in the coffee.  Nor could I isolate any pumpkin pie taste; rather, the primary flavor was of cinnamon.  Since pumpkin pie has more complex spicing than simply a cinnamon flavor, I was puzzled by the choice of name for this otherwise very good product.<br /><br />This is a very good choice for anyone who likes spiced beverages, and who wants a good cup of flavored coffee.  I think that you might enjoy this on a cold, winter day while sitting in front of a nice fire and reading a good book - perhaps on your Kindle!",4

B0002XIAXE,"In fairness to the product itself, I did taste it and it does taste good. However, I couldn't get over the fact that there was no safety seal or tamper evident seal. I know I'm probably too paranoid, but in this day and age I like to see some type of safety seal on products I'm going to consume. I think that there should at least be a button that pops up when you open the bottle. But that's just me. The order came in 6 bottles. I didn't return them, because the next buyer would have absolutely no evidence that I opened one of the bottles. So it's a loss to me. Oh well, I guess it's one of the risks of ordering from the internet, not being able to inspect the packaging before purchase.",3

However, this product has little taste!  I guess that is good compared to some green products, but compared to Greens First this is not a pleasant experience.  Greens First actually makes me look forward to my greens each day.  Those that thought this product tasted good and was minty should try Greens First if they want a real taste treat.<br /><br />For me, this product just didn't cut it.  I immediately dropped my subscription after my first can.",2
B005VOOM4A,"Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me.",2

B004X3VRLG,"I got one bag as a sample for review and tried giving one of the treats to my dog, but she wasn't willing to give it a serious try. I let her keep it for a week and every once in a while she'd toss it around the living room or pick it up and carry it around for a minute, but she never made any real effort to eat it.<br /><br />I ended up giving 2 of them to my nephew's dog, and he seemed to like them all right. I took the remainder to a playdate my dog was having with 3 other dogs and out of those one chewed on one a little but didn't seem awfully interested, one took no interest at all, and one really liked them. I tossed the bag after the playdate, forgetting that I'd want it for reference, but I seem to remember not being very thrilled by the ingredient list either.<br /><br />The final tally for me was 2 dogs out of 5 who seemed to like it, 1 who thought it was okay but nothing special, and 2 who didn't have any real interest.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with these at all and I can't see myself recommending them to anyone. Given that my own dog wouldn't eat hers, I definitely won't consider buying them in the future.<br /><br />Edit: Leaving my original review intact, but reducing from 2 stars to 1. I just heard that the dog that liked these the most was chewing on it a while after I went home and started whimpering. Her owners found that her gums were bleeding. It might just be a random thing that she bit at it wrong and no fault of the treat, but given the other problems people have reported having with these I wouldn't want to gamble on it. I'm definitely not going to be recommending these to anyone.",1
B001LXYA5Q,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful.",4

If you put them in a bowl, add milk or rice milk to soften a bit, then add your cereal, nuts, whatever, you make a really great breakfast with a fruit flavor, no matter what the season. This particular brand is the only organic one where the berries are grown & processed in the U.S. I get them on Amazon's auto-ship plan, which brings the price down quite a bit, making it far lower than getting an equivalent in a market - which frankly, you can't, because even organic stores don't usually list where their freeze-dried berries are grown.",4

What you do is use the Spiedie sauce to marinate cubes of chicken overnight, then just grill them up, slide 'em on a soft italian roll and add some mayo. Bam! Good eats! I use this stuff at home in the DC area and I would highly recommend the marinade to anyone looking for a something different in their chicken!",5
B004ZIER34,"Coffee is one of my favorite things in life.  The decaf variety is usually as flavorful and fragrant as regular caffeinated coffee, so I pretty much expected a coffee with low acid to be at least comparable with decaffeinated.  Not exactly, but it might have been my fault.  After checking the package carefully I could find nothing that indicated how much water to use with the packet contents.  So, I made a regular 8 cup brew.  Upon opening the package I did not get the burst of wonderful coffee fragrance.  No coffee fragrance while brewing either.  It tasted like coffee but, for me, it was just so-so... nothing to get excited about.  There again, I'll take the blame -- I probably had too much water.  That's why I picked 3 stars or ""middle of the road.""  If I have an opportunity to try it again with the right amount of coffee grounds for the water, I will surely update this review.  I hope they will indicate on their future packages how much water is recommended.",3

B0045XE32E,"The real reviewer - Indiana Jones (aka Indy Bear) a 13ish mix that came straight from the humane society.  Over the last 12 years Indy has been through cancer, hip displaysia, severe arthritis, and several tummy issues that his vet referred to as ""garbage gut"" and now he's lost his hearing.<br /><br />Did I mention that he's a pudgy dog?  Maybe its spending the first year of his life in a pound, but even now - he LOVES to eat.  So when the opportunity to try a new snack came along, he informed me that it was my only choice.<br /><br />I do like that these are organic... not that my dog cares. But I still would prefer if the first ingredient was a meat or meat based product.  My dog has canine teeth made for gripping, tearing, and scissoring which means that the rest of his body is set up for the consumption of MEAT.  Not corn, potatoes, barley etc.  Now granted the ingredients in here are far better than a milkbone, but you pay for them as well.<br /><br />These come in a nice little rectangle shape that is scored down the middle (like a short fat graham cracker) I didn't bother breaking it at the score because he would know and not leave me alone until the other half appeared.  Needless to say - they are VERY hard, but apparently quite tasty.  I don't know that a little dog, or a baby puppy could eat them but since Indy is a 60lbs Australian Shepherd/Springer Spaniel mix (with a smattering of other doggies in there too) he had no trouble eating them.  Much like all food it disappeared quickly with little to no facial expression so I can only assume that they must be okay.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to purchase these - I did like that they came in a bag rather than a box, but would have preferred a more ""green"" bag rather than plastic.  If you are going to go organic, then go all the way and give me some eco-friendly packaging.<br /><br />Much love to Newman's for being on the right track and trying to offer us healthier food for our four legged family members.",4
B0041NYV8E,"I'm not a huge ginger fan, but I have had a lot of ginger tea and the like lately because of a pregnancy (its supposed to ease an upset stomach). This stuff I would not reach for again. In fact, I might not even finish the cup in front of me. It's really....bitter? No, not even that. There's that weird sort of tang ginger has, and this has it big-time, even though I actually watered it down more than I should have (really, it's about 1 packet to 1 measured cup of water). I really only taste the lemon as an aftertaste.<br /><br />Also, the actual stuff is a bit weird. If you're used to the now common little packets of powder you add to a bottle of water, this is WAY more powder to mix in. The packet is about the size of a large teabag, but full. It's also a different consistency...almost looks like small betta fish food. It also smells weird to me.<br /><br />In short, if you want a ginger-lemon hot drink, there are many better alternatives in my opinion.",1
B0016B7Z32,I had hoped this tea would taste better but it just tastes to me like I steeped weeds from the backyard.,2
B008O3G25W,"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.",2

Virtually NO aftertaste, quick dissolving and convenient. It is also very economical at 1.5 cents a serving. I use a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly. Do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder - you'll be happy you did!",5
B0007A0AP8,"My dog is very picky, to say the least. He's super cute, but is very picky about treats. He won't eat any biscuits, doesn't like most fake ""meat"" treats, and won't eat bacon. Because of this, he has hurt many an eager pet shop employee's feelings. However, he LOVES these treats. We just adopted him from the shelter, and his previous owners didn't teach him much. These treats are making training so much easier. He'll do almost anything for them.<br /><br />They're pretty big, so you can rip them up into much smaller pieces. They will dry out if you leave the package open, so they have to be sealed each time.<br /><br />I know I'm echoing most of the other reviews when I say this, but these are fantastic treats.",5
B002LANN56,"I can't/won't feed this to my own dogs because of food allergies, and there's the mysterious ""animal fat"" and ""animal digest"" in this ingredient list which makes me a little nervous about which animal it came from.  Really, the ingredient list is terrible, it's a bunch of leftover food waste products made into dog food.  Beef is the first ingredient in the list, but when you add up all the forms of soy, corn, and wheat in the ingredient list, there's more junk in this dog food than beef.<br /><br />*BUT*, my family's dog is a picky eater and this Chef Michael's dog food is perfect for her because she's used to treats and flavorful table scraps (bad, bad habit that I don't approve of) and she snubs healthier kibbles.  Salt makes this kibble tasty.  With the ingredient list, this kibble reminds me of salted kinda-meaty Cheetos, complete with unnecessary food colorings.<br /><br />For my own dogs, this would be a 1-star food (honestly, I think this is junk and overpriced too for what it is), but this food does have its uses if you don't really mind what's in it and you have a picky dog and need extra flavorings to entice them to eat dry dog food.",3
B0016FY6H6,"The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.

I realize this is not a review, let alone a ""helpful review"", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.

B001EQ5EJQ,"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very ""walnutty,"" I would still like it!)<br /><br />Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!",5
B000GW46D4,I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky. I bought these because I thought it would be much easier to transport with me on the go like road trips but the taste is way off compared to the bagged jerky and I didnt care for it. Very dissapointed in the taste.,2

B004P4TL8E,"I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.<br /><br />I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k-cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k-cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer.",3

B0007A0AQM,"I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the ""natural"" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the ""natural"" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs.",2

They are predominantly cinnamon-flavored and do not feel as complex as I expected - I was expecting perhaps more of a charred oak flavor. Overall they are not bad, and I can certainly find some use for them, but they are priced fairly high, and I personally still prefer Angostura bitters in my Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.",3

B00430B73W,"the review is about the 'hazelnut chocolate' bar.  as you know, ingredients are always listed in order of how much.<br /><br />now check this, from the label:<br /><br />""Cashews, organic agave nectar, organic sunflower seed kernels, dates, cocoa processed with alkali, hazelnuts, almonds sprouted flax seed.""<br /><br />you can now see how much hazelnut is really in there:  very little!  but they splash 'hazelnut' on the label.",1
B003VXFK44,"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed.",2
B001LGGH40,"The Switch in Kiwi Berry is quite tasty-  it's very berry but not quite kiwi...The kiwi is very subdued, seems like it enhances the tartness of the berry but doesn't quite warrant ""kiwi"" in the flavor title....<br /><br />The Switch is a good replacement for traditional sugar/corn syrup laden sodas...It is not necessarily lower in carbs, as the sweetness comes from the juices...For me, as a diabetic, I would use these instead of coke or juice boxes when treating a hypoglycemic episode... My child does not like anything ""sparkling"" but if I had kids who liked soda, I would probably try to move them over to something like this (actually, probably to water or sparkling water with a splash of juice) for special occasions...<br /><br />The flavor is very sweet (even though it is ""natural"" from the juices) and very tasty... The carbonation is light and sparkling- the flavor and carbonation reminded me of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider, but a little more fun...",4
B007OXJK3Y,"If you just want to smell your coffee this is the product for you.  It smells amazing and so chocolatey, but the taste is off.  It isn't chocolate tasting at all maybe a little sweet or artificial.  I much prefer the mudslide for chocolate coffee.",3
B000X9NRKS,"It had all the excitement and sensation for my dog (and still does) when I give him one.  But after eating one, kinda finishing a second one a few days later, by the third one, he took off, went to his spot, and seemed to enjoy it.  But alas, it stayed there for days ... uneaten.<br /><br />Smells like the real thing, but my little baby AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER (B I G  D O G !) just looks at it sitting there with such sadness and disappointment on his face ...... If only he turned around to see how sad I felt trying to pass off some HEALTHY knock-off for a real pigs ear!<br /><br />My poor baby. :(<br /><br />GOOD THING I BOUGHT A BAG OF 36 THOUGH ..... IT TAUGHT ME! A LESSON.",1
B001RVFDOO,"These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.<br />Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores.",1
B000F7RZG0,I started using these syrups in my coffee when I went on the Atkins diet. It uses Splenda and taste  pretty good. It doesn't have that syrupy after taste like a lot of these syrups. It's great if you're dieting & have a sweet tooth because it's carb-free. If I was more creative I could probably add the flavoring to other meals on my diet.,4
B002GPNT32,"I decided to try and find a horchata that tasted like the kind I'd drink when growing up in San Diego. So far, this has been the furthest from it. This product has a chalky, almost dry taste to it. It's not awful, but not the taste I was expecting. There is an aftertaste that seems like flour or some other similar flavor. Obviously, liking the flavor is subjective, but I will not be purchasing this brand again. When Amazon has it in stock, the Klass brand horchata is my preference so far.",2
B00283V4GQ,I bought these lollipops for my daughter's 3rd Birthday. They are super cute and the kids loved them. Definitely met my expectations.,5
B0009YUCM8,"I want folks to know that this ear cleaner definitely has a distinct odor, contrary to what the other review says. However, I am buying lots more of this great stuff, as my kitties don't mind it at all and I find it to be very gentle, effective and it really is natural, with only 4 ingredients. Plus it's alcohol-free, so I have peace of mind that it is safe for my babies and not harsh in any way. And I found it for the cheapest price on Amazon - the key is to buy several bottles for lower shipping & you may as well, since it only comes in a 4 oz size! Stock up now!",4
B0045XE32E,"When I read the ingredients of these treats I thought for sure that my dogs would like these. I have 3 large breed dogs which usually love to eat just about anything. I have Rocky, a black and tan coonhound, Buddy, a blue heeler and a very large pit bull named Hutch. Rocky and Buddy have turned up their noses in disdain to these treats everytime I have offered them. The pit bull Hutch will eat them very grudgingly and even then he'll leave half of the treat on the ground, this is odd because, he'll eat just about anything including tree branches. So, I wouldn't pay the higher price for these treats, my dogs just don't like them.",2
B006N3I84I,"I searched for a coffee that was not extra bold. This is not listed anywhere as ""extra bold"" yet that is what arrived at my door. Stuck with it, I've been drinking it, but not at all enjoying it. I will not buy another of this brand because now I just don't trust it.",3
B001P05K7M,"this was my first time buying the hextra chews for my two dogs. they like them but i had no idea that it would leave stains on my rugs, carpet and furniture since the product description had no warning of this. i read some reviews where others didn't have this staining problem so maybe i just got a bad batch? even so, i wouldn't recommend the hextra chews just incase and would suggest getting the other version, C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces.",2
B000ETAJZ8,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.,1
B005JTMZVO,"Other than for novelty purposes, I really cannot recommend this product.  There is a strong odor of smoked bacon that emanates from the popcorn, but it is has a strong artificial plastic odor to it.  The flavor of bacon really seems to be overwhelmed by a taste of smokiness.  I would think it is more accurate to say smoked popcorn than bacon popcorn. At first I thought it might just be me, but when I shared them with my friends, they took an initial handful for the novelty, and then stopped. The more I tried it, the worse it tasted to the point where the smell was just nauseating.  But I do admit that people get a kick out of receiving it as a gift.",2
B00472I5A4,"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could.",1

B001EQ5EQE,"Before I ordered this coffee, I read reviews both here at Amazon and on other sites.  I used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it.  I am a lover of Starbucks Espresso Decaf coffee.  I have my own Breville espresso machine at home.  I have been using Starbucks for years.  My Lavazzo coffee arrived and I was eager to give it a try.  I opened the tin to find brown coffee - while I already knew I would be disappointed because I already know I prefer Black coffee beans to brown. While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So. My verdict here is, if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee DO NOT buy this product.  If you prefer brown bean coffee, give it a go.",1
B007TJGZ5E,"Green Mountain Coffee, Nantucket Blend is my favorite coffee to use in my Keurig Brewer.  However, in this particular box, the coffee did not taste fresh.  Perhaps due to the large quantity in one box, it remained in storage too long.  At any rate, previous orders from other Amazon sellers, like az trading llc and pm trading, and smaller-quantity boxes from Amazon.com LLC were far superior.",2
B001CX3QOG,"14 out of 24 cans arrived dented, due to inadequate packaging (boxes were shrink wrapped to a cardboard tray and then thrown in a shipping box with a small amount of butcher paper).  Dense material like canned goods should be surrounded with packing peanuts in order to arrive undamaged.  Needless to say, I will not order canned goods again through Amazon.<br /><br />This is not the end of the story.  Amazon's standard policy on damaged food is 10%, or 20% maximum discount.  In this case, 58.3% of the food  arrived damaged--and no way was I going to pay for what I won't use.  After 1/2 hour on the phone, the customer service manager granted me an ""exception"" and allowed a refund of 58.3% of my purchase price.  But I should not have had to waste so much of my time insisting on it.<br /><br />That said, Harmony Farms dog food itself is a great product.  The reason I'm willing to pay almost $2 per can is that it's made in the USA (no danger of melamine, etc.).  So there you have it.  Good product, but you'll probably be happier if you find a place to buy it locally.",1
B003VTN95K,"These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!",5
B007TJGZ54,Not strong enough for the first cup in the morning.  I need something strong to wake me up. Maybe I should have found a stronger blend,2

B001ET5XWQ,"If you're looking for a full-bodied, rich dark-roast decaf, keep looking.  The only way to make this coffee worth drinking is to use 1.5 times the amount I usually use for a dark roast.  Even then, it's nothing special.",2
B001EQ55ZO,"The first couple of bites are extremely salty and made me feel like I was over salivating due to all the salt on my tongue.  After a couple of bites, I found the nuts strangely addicting because of the nice pepper taste.<br /><br />I'm not positive if it was because of the amount of salt or the fact that it was sea salt. If the saltiness could be halved down or even paired down to a quarter what it is now, it would be much better. It may certainly fit the beer drinking snack scene, but it's not something I would give to my toddler due to the salt and spiciness of it.",3

B001LXYA5Q,"Heard about these and simply had to check them out. Ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of ""flavor tripping."" That is exactly what it was, the tablets themself have an odd taste (not the best) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything I've had before. Lemons, kiwi, strawberries, cheese, mustard, cranberry juice, OJ, and a lot more. IT all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time. Everything was sweet and tasted (with few exclusions) much better. I ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite.<br /><br />These really are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who likes food.",5

I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.",3

When I received my one little box of 12 today, I went back to their amazon listing to see what happened, and sure enough, there is a warning that what's pictured is not a representation of what you're buying, and nowhere do they state exactly how many Fizzie tabs you're buying.  I wonder how many other people have been burned the same way.  If it's been a problem in the past, what they should do is post an accurate photo and accurate description.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />I will NOT be buying anything from this merchant again.",1

B004YV7LIK,"After my doctor said no more coffee, not even decaf, I gave this a try.  We have a home espresso machine and a daily latte is part of my morning routine.  While this doesn't taste just like coffee, it is really good in its own way.  It has a deep, rich flavor like coffee, that tea just doesn't have.  I tried making tea lattes as a substitute at first, and they just didn't cut it.  Honestly, I would sometimes pick this over coffee.  It is really good.  The chocolate flavor is delicious.<br /><br />I put two Tbsp of this in my portafilter and pull a shot as normal.  You do need to scrub out your filter a bit afterwards and your portafilter needs to be completely dry before putting the teeccino in or it will stick together in a clump and the shot will not pull right.  It is stickier than coffee.  I also enjoy this as an iced latte.  For an extra treat, put a Tbsp or two of cocoa powder into the bottom of your glass, mix with the shot, then add milk and sweetener of choice, make a great iced mocha.  I use coconut palm sugar, which when mixed with steamed milk creates a kind of marshmallowy taste.  Combined with the teeccino, yum!",4

I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating.

Again, its use is very limited.<br /><br />Don't like the BPA issue either.  I did speak to Wolfgang Puck about PBA and their plans.

The outside of the cookies are a pale shade of brown almost grey.  Inside they are darker.  I don't know why that is.  They are a crunchy cookie (but not hard) with chocolate chips that are large in comparison to the size of the cookie.  The cookies themselves are bite sized.<br /><br />Out of all the Newman's Own Family Recipe cookies that I have tried my favorite to date is their Ginger Snaps.  They have heat & a pleasant bite to them plus bits of chewy ginger.  In second place is their Orange Chocolate Chip cookies.  These smell so wonderful & the orange flavor stands out.  Last we have this sorry lot.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars because 2 stars means ""I don't like"" them.  So while I don't actually hate them, I don't want to eat them again.",2
B001EQ55RW,"These tasty almonds are very (VERY) lightly-covered with dark cocoa powder, but if I hadn't read the label, I wouldn't have noticed.  The thin coating gives off an unknown, slightly muddy flavor that is not unpleasant, but if you're looking for a strong, true chocolate taste, skip these nuts.  (I think they would taste better without the coating.)<br /><br />There are 11 servings in a jar, each with 150 calories, and the lid measures one serving perfectly.  They're good and crunchy and I like them, even though they don't have the chocolate flavor I was expecting.",4
B002IEZJMA,"I don't use sugar in my coffee or tea and this product has sugar in it. It is way too sugary for me but otherwise had a pleasant coffee taste, not bitter and very smooth to drink. This is an espresso based product so it will be high in caffeine.<br /><br />If you are not used to strong coffee flavors then this might overpower you but if you are used to espresso or very strong coffees, then you might like the flavor of this coffee drink. It is rich tasting but not overpowering. But if you are like me and do not like sugar, then you will be disappointed with the sweetness of this coffee drink.<br />If you use sugar in your coffee and also like strong coffee flavors then you might like this product. I think though that it would have been really good without the sugar.",3

B0000GJ7D0,"I really enjoy getting good horchata having traveled throughout Latin America and many Mexican restaurants in the US. For the most part, it's a hard drink to mess up if you make it yourself; it may not end up being amazingly delicious, but definitely something worth drinking. When I saw this drink mix in the store, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Suffice to say that I was supremely disappointed. I tried it with water, and no amount of drink mix could salvage it from tasting and looking like dirty water. Blech... With milk, it got mildly better, but I would much prefer a glass of milk to the nasty, plastic-y taste this added.<br /><br />Stay away!

B003LE6PL0,"The stargazer lillies in this bouquet have an amazing scent that fills a room, which the recepient told me was ""heavenly"". They live quite long when cared for properly, but it's important to remember that these particular flowers ship in bud form -- on delivery day, they aren't like the picture on the page here, but will reach that point in 3 or 4 days' time. Take that into account and plan ahead.<br /><br />The reason to choose this one over the standard version is the extra stems of the stargazer lillies because, as I mentioned earlier, the scent they carry is fantastic (the more the merrier!).",5

B004YV80OE,"I have always loved Velveeta so I thought I would love their skillets. Unfortunately, no. It was very easy to make, just brown chicken, add 2 1/2 cups of water & season packet & pasta and boil, add packet with the broccoli bits, cover & let boil to most of the water is gone & then add the cheese packet. I was expecting larger pasta like shells or rotini but instead it was orzo. Orzo looks like large grains of rice. I made the skillet & it looked delicious, unfortunately, the taste is where I was disappointed. I don't know what it was, maybe the season packet, but the taste was just off & not good in any way. I would rather have made their shells & cheese & added my own broccoli & chicken. I ended up picking the chicken out and throwing the rest away. This was a first for me, I tend to like almost any boxed pasta & cheese meal or side dish.  For broccoli lovers, the broccoli is extremely small, barely noticeable & virtually tasteless. So keep that in mind if you are looking for something with broccoli. I was really expecting better from Velveeta.",2
B000H24052,"I m a fan of this soup maker; I have purchased Bear Creek Creamy Potato and Brocolli Cheddar in large cans, each sufficient for 24 servings. Bear Creek shipped them directly to me, but their phone no longer works nor does their email address.They were well priced at 10.00, kept forever, and much could be done to these soups to make a short and simple meal fancy enough for friends. So, as a trial, I ordered this soup-in-a-sack from Amazon. The shipping box had no padding; soup was spilled from a couple of the sacks....and there seems to be teeth marks in the sacks of soup....so,upon openning the package, I immediately,emailed Amazon asking them to get this soup out of my kitchen. They never replied. I do not recommend any Bear Creek in a sack products....not only because of a critter problem but also since they are far more expensive than the large cans.",1

B001RVFDOO,"I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.",4
B00438MLHK,"I ordered a case of each. The tomatoe chili are the worst sardines I've ever tried. The title should read sardines in tomatoe and sugar, as sugar is placed in the ingrediants before salt or chili powder. Besides the sauce the fish did not seem to have good flavor either. The case in smoked oil were quite good, good taste and the fish were medium sized with good flavor and texture. I would rate them 4 or 5 stars but the tomatoe chili deserve no stars or negative stars.",1
B001OCKIP0,"I'm not one of those people who consider granola as breakfast because it's often too sweet and sticky.

I guess I'd rather go all healthy or all indulgent.",3

I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.

B004ZIER34,"Yes - I suffer from heartburn.  Something about aging that I'm just not enjoying.  So when this came up to try, I thought it was a great idea!  As a caffeine addict from way back, I can't give up my morning cup of joe just because of a little stomach acid!<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not a fan of French roast.  I refer to it as ""French burnt"" because it really tastes burnt to me.  So, though this still tasted burnt, it didn't taste different than any other French roast I've had.  So no marks off for that.<br /><br />It comes already ground, and wow, is it ground!  It's like powder, which I don't like.  I usually use K-cups, but when I get ""real"" coffee, I prefer it whole bean because it 1) lasts longer and 2) I can grind it the way I like, which is quite a bit more coarse than this is.  Puroast has taken care of the ""lasts longer"" issue because this comes in small bags.  I don't like the powdery grind though.  I use a French press, and the powder tends to get through the filter.  This should work well on a regular coffee maker with a paper filter, but this really isn't the best for a French press.  (Puroast does make whole bean as well - yay!)<br /><br />I didn't notice an increase in heartburn, which is really great.  Of course, I didn't notice much of a lessening either.  It's possible my morning coffee isn't my problem, so I'm not going to mark off stars for that either.  (The product description says it helps 90% of customers - I'm apparently special.)<br /><br />A coffee snob probably wouldn't go for this (Pre-ground???  Really???  Please!) but for the rest of us, it's not bad.  Again, I don't like French roast much, but if you do, then this should taste all right.  (My husband likes it.)  There's a strong flavor, but it's not bitter.  It comes in small packages, so even though ground, it shouldn't get stale.  It won't make your heartburn worse.  The price seems a little high ($24 for 30 oz or 10 packages), but you can save with Subscribe & Save, and if it helps with your heartburn, then it's worth the price.",4

B000OU5EKC,"I just bought his item off Amazon. The shipment came very fast, but some of the cans were dented. They packed it very poorly, they literally jut put it in a cardboard box along with a case of another canned food item. There was nothing but a couple of those air-filled bags in there with the 2 cases. They both got banged around pretty good before delivery. Both cases had several dented cans from the shipping, so a very bad score from Amazon for packaging by people that don't care.<br /><br />As for the CBH itself, I personally found the low-fat version too low in fat! It didn't render any fat when I cooked it in a non-stick frying pan. I had to add oil to keep it from sticking which defeats the purpose of the non-fat feature. Even so, it still came out pretty dry tasting, it didn't have that rich smooth taste that a little more fat will provide. Even without the normal amount of fat, this product still tasted fine.<br /><br />I can't really say this is a complaint about the product. After all, I knowingly ordered a low-fat version of the product to try it out and put in the disaster prep stockpile. I just want to let people know that this is a good product, but it will not cook or taste like regular CBH will. It is dryer and less flavorful. But, it does have less fat and if that is important to you, then this should fit the bill.<br /><br />I am knocking off 1 star for the truly awful packing\shipping.<br /><br />-Mike",3

If you like a `fruity' tea without the heavy doses of fruit flavor then this could work for you; unless you do not like pulps.

B001LGGH40,"Are you looking for a relatively healthy option for soda?  well, look no further!  This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of the things I like, and the things that I did not like as much:<br /><br />First, the positive:<br /><br />The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor, that means Kiwi and Berry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable, which is very nice!<br /><br />The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.<br /><br />The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you, but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes, I know you can always pour out what is more than want, but how often does that happen?<br /><br />The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch, brief case, computer case, etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty, the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people.<br /><br />The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 135 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison, Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson, a serving size of Coca-cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So, do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!<br /><br />I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line, but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses, 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.<br /><br />Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.<br /><br />Ok, so overall, this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink, just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!<br /><br />The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count, the price, the volume you need to order, and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that, no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives).",4

B006N3IG4K,"This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A"">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.",3

The container is great though!<br /><br />The container is labelled:  Refrigerate after opening.  I hadn't planned on refrigerating these, but perhaps I should.  Anyhow, if you're ordering them, make room in your fridge for a container about the size of a pickle jar from the bulk foods section.<br /><br />As far as flavor... try to imagine your standard green (Spanish) pimento-stuffed olive but using a a black olive.

B000NY8OLK,"""New Recipe"" turns out to be an imitation of a bad dark chocolate. When I opened the package, I was not struck with the aroma of good bittersweet chocolate. When a piece hit my tongue, it conjured up memories of awful aftertastes of many bad milk and some dark chocolate. The nasty aftertaste never actually materialized. Still, Lindt should be worried.<br /><br />So I looked at the ingredients. First on the list is chocolate, some unknown, pre-made chocolate. Shouldn't the first ingredient be cocoa powder or cocoa something? Lindt started making chocolate in China some time ago. Are they churning out this ""New Recipe"" with ""Made-In-China"" chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter and so on? By the way, the 85% cocoa bar's ingredient list also starts with chocolate, followed by cocoa powder, sugar... At least it contains enough cocoa powder to fool me for a while. I suppose it could be worse: Lindt could have substituted partially hydrogenated junk for cocoa butter.<br /><br />I just bought Trader Joe's Swiss 72% cocoa Dark Chocolate for $1.99. It smells and tastes right for me. Its color is just a shade lighter than Lindt 70%. Ingredients: cocoa mass, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, Madagascar vanilla. I can see myself sticking with this one until something better shows up or returns.",2

B006N3IG4K,"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",3

The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.

If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.

It's not an aficionado's coffee, not so much because of flavor rather than that it comes pre-ground.  It kind of fits in a quirky in between niche.  Not for the Folgers crowd but not for the gourmand either.  All in all, not bad.  My biggest complaint was the packaging.  This was sealed so tightly that I pretty much had to destroy the bag to get it open.  I guess this may be symptomatic of premium pre-ground coffee because they are trying to keep in as much flavor as possible.  However, as an average consumer I find it annoying.",3

Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round.",4
B002TMV34E,"I've been a fan of the Melitta system for years. It's simple, and eliminates the expense of an<br />appliance. For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better ""gourmet"" coffees<br />out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents.",4

When we got them (within 1/2 an hour), they were placed into the freezer until use.  As we use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave (for a quick warm-up).  However, still I am fearful each time I rip into a small package, that I will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookie.<br /><br />This is, obviously, not conducive to enjoyment while eating them.<br /><br />We have NEVER had this problem with any of the the big cookie variety.<br /><br />**UPDATE:**  02/15/12  - Today I opened my door to find a box sent to me from Erin Baker's... and it had 2 boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis (the exact amount that I had found to be moldy in my original order).  AMAZING company.  Check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about.  TOP MARKS to this company.  Not only fabulous breakfast cookies, but amazing customer service (which THEY volunteered - I did NOT ask for!!!)",5

I have tried every product out there to make pancakes, waffles, biscuits and even chicken fingers and was so pleasantly suprised that this little box does it all and does it all WONDERFUL...

B003KV7V1C,"This jerky has great flavor and a perfect consistency but is quite salty. Its chew is ideal for a tender jerky, it's not overly softened by enzymes to the point of crumbling, yet still retains a bit of a chew so feels like actual jerky. All of the pieces are nicely trimmed and cut against the grain from good quality beef.<br /><br />The flavor is very nice as well, there's a distinct garlic flavor and a solid spicy taste. It's definitely not extremely spicy though, if you aren't phased by Tabasco sauce then this jerky will not be very hot to you. For me, the saltiness of this jerky is considerably more intense than the spiciness. My mouth remains parched many minutes after eating this, so be prepared to drink a lot of water since it's salt content is considerably higher than the average jerky.<br /><br />The saltiness didn't overwhelm too much though so I was still able to experience the really nice flavor and consistency of the meat.  A lot of jerky companies use papaya enzymes to tenderize their jerky, but it tends to make it artificially soft and crumbly, sticky even. Buffalo Bill's does not use these enzymes which I assume is why they are pretty heavy on the salt since it's such a good tenderizer. if they were able to lower the salt and retain the same constancy than this would without a doubt be 5-star perfect jerky.<br /><br />This is still very good stuff though and if you are not too bothered by high salt foods and like a little spice then you should definitely give this a try.",4
B001DTKJH6,"I haven't tried these yet; they have just arrived, but I wanted to warn fellow customers that you will be receiving 56 TOTAL ounces (four packages of 14 ounces each):  that adds up to 72 cents per ounce! Amazon has given me an appropriate refund, so props to them.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Flavor-wise I enjoyed these pumpkin raviolis:  Are they worth the specialty 40.00 dollar price?  -I would say not because the pumpkin flavor gets overwhelmed by the sauce and even by the ravioli pasta itself.  Another issue is that the raviolis are covered in powder and thus make a mess, especially when recycling.  I would pay 20-30 dollars for this product for a gift, but probably not 40.",2

B000GAUKP4,"The piece of dried peach was overly dry, chewy, and unappetizing. Not wanting to waste a piece of fruit, I put it in an empty birdbath outside for the squirrels or birds. Serendipitously it rained that night, and the next morning I discovered a rehydrated peach with a totally different appearance and appeal. I've since learned that dehydrated fruit can be rehydrated by soaking it in hot water for a few minutes. It can even be hydrated with fruit juice for even more flavor.<br /><br />The Mariani mixed fruit is convenient for those who like having fruit on hand, but want to avoid the waste of fresh fruit going over-ripe before one gets around to eating it. It's a nice mix of fruit that all ends up having similar taste since the eclectic mix has been together in the close quarters of a bag for so long. My favorites in the mix are the dried apples and dried pears. Dried plums predominate in this Mariani product, but they are pretty good too.<br /><br />For best taste, put the opened bag in your refrigerator. Refrigeration ensures freshness and cuts down on the icky, sticky factor of the dried fruits.",4

B005BPVE90,"Eat. Think. Smile's Oatmeal Raisin bars are a nice alternative to a mid-day candy bar. While perhaps not as tasty as something dipped in chocolate, the Eat. Think. Smile bars are baked and are relatively low in fat (7g, and only 1g saturated fat) although somewhat high in carbohydrates (34g) They also contain CocoaOne, which is described as ""a unique blend of African cocoa and a premium Meso-American variety known ads Lavado,"" supposedly a natural antioxident.<br /><br />Taste-wise, the Eat. Think. Smile bars taste much like a Cliff bar, and have the same shape and texture. The Eat Think Smile bars have a softer texture, and are more crumbly than a Cliff bar.<br />The oatmeal raisin taste is pleasant and not at all overwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, I liked these bars. While not a replacement for a good breakfast or healthy lunch, these bars are perfect for that time of the day when you want a little snack, but don't necessarily want all of the fat and extras in a typical candy bar.",4

B000H23YC2,"This gravy is great!  1/4 cup has only 50 calories and 6 grams of carbs, which has helped my husband loose over 20 pounds.  How?  Well the low carbs helped, but the main feature that makes low-cal/low-carbs part of the formula work, is the great taste.  This gravy has got a peppery tang that makes it just right for spicing up eggs or chicken or anything else you might through a white pepper gravy over.<br /><br />And I don't know if you have tried other packaged sauces, but I have, and generally they aren't very good even when freshly made.  Worse, these sauces tend to get 'strange' in the fridge overnight.  (Oddly watery, or jell-like... yuck)  This S&M Gravy mix doesn't do that, which means that it's good for several meals.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the gravy-challenged.

I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast.

B000F0FX52,"The Sprout Master is made nicely and looks like it will last a long time.  I disagree with those that say it is flimsy.  It seems sturdy to me.  In terms of quality, it seems fine.  But in terms of growing sprouts from small seeds, there are 2 main problems, it seems:<br /><br />(1) It has pin-size holes for drainage, and small seeds get stuck in these and grow their roots through them. I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds). Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean. What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath. So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout. The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts. I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken. I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon). It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store. I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this. I am not sure why. So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter. I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead. They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master. I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds. Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />(2) Clean-up:  The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes. You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse. No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm. Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />***By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments. Thanks! ***",3
B001LGGH40,"I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.<br /><br />Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.<br /><br />Not very good.",2

There are a few other cookies being marketed as ""gluten free"" or ""diet"" but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.

No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)

B001E5DQGK,"Prior to ordering I misunderstood what truffle oil is... I warmly encourage potential buyers first to google ""truffle oil""--you'll discover that there's no such thing. The ""truffle essence"" put in this and other truffle oils is a synthetic ingredient, whipped up in a lab, that mimics just one flavor of truffles. The aftertaste this (and any truffle oil) leaves is chemical. In order to make it work in a dish, you'll have cover it with garlic and other seasonings: basically, hide the flavor.<br /><br />There are some oils available through Amazon in which actual truffles are infused, but the problem is that oil doesn't easily absorb real truffle essence, so the presence of authentic truffle flavor is very weak and nearly undetectable.<br /><br />If you like this artificial flavor, then the price is right ($). But if you want real truffle flavor, get the real thing ($$$).",1
B001534R00,"I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.<br /><br />Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM"">CelsiusÂ®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG"">CelsiusÂ®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product.",2

The liquid center in these candies is gone and the cherries inside are all dried up.  Somehow the liquid filling either evaporated are just dried up as there is no sticky evidence of leaking in the box.  Also, the milk chocolate has a chalky look as if it has oxidized.

Am I an idiot? Maybe... Still, if you need 2Tbs of peanut butter you will use almost 4 Tbs. I have only used it once so did not get good measurements because there was lots of adding more water or powder and also I usually weigh ingredients and as another reviewer pointed out the weight and volume on the label didn't match.

B000LTIDR2,I hope that Kelloggs stops trying to save $.01 cent by using High Fructose instead of sugar and gets out of bed with the US Corn Industry.,2
B000FYVKRS,"The taste was somewhat greasy.  Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better.",2
B00002NCJC,We have used the Victor fly bait for 3 seasons.  Can't beat it.  Great product!,5
B002JWZVWO,"Recently a friend told me to try coconut water when I told her I needed a potassium supplement. I've tried maybe a dozen brands now and have 2-3 favorites. One is ONE. ;-) The guava really adds to the flavor. I also just tried the mango and will be ordering that soon as well. There's a lot of variation with coconut water. Some taste just like water, some have a mild sweetness, some are more coconutty than others. And some are bitter. I recommend trying several to see what suits your tastebuds and budget.",4
B001H17CJS,"I am a regular purchaser of the Holistic Select dog snacks, but saw these biscuits when I ordered last and decided to give them a try.  All four of my japanese chin loved these treats, though they still seem to go more wild for the regular dog treats.  I can cut the dog treats into smaller pieces, while the biscuits tend to crumble more if I try to cut them to smaller portions.  However, these seem to have more teeth cleaning ability than the regular treats.  I am happy with this purchase and will definitely keep them on hand as an alternative snack!",4
B006F2NYI2,So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.,5
B0085G4ACA,Shipping great and loved product. The boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish.  I suggest buy only little ones this way.,5
B002BCD2GO,The price is very good.  I used this a lot to make my own protein bars.  I just wish it was in a glass bottle rather than plastic.,4
B001SB1R7A,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.,5
B001LGGH40,"I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't.",1
B001CHFSUW,"Yuck, this is terrible coffee. I gave it to a relative who was considering a Keurig, and this coffee made her reconsider. It is just awful!",2
B004ZIER34,"Yes it is low acid and doesn't cause acid indigestion or heart burn. It had a really full bodied aroma while brewing but fell a bit short on taste - but I'm a black coffee drinker so sharpness & flavour are very noticeable to me. My husband (who does take cream & sweetener in his coffee) said it was a good cup of coffee to his taste.<br />I think it may have been the ""dark french roast"" that to me tasted a bit ""woody"".<br />So I'll give this 4 stars & try again, with a different roast.<br />My final analysis is, if you get heartburn or acid indigestion drinking coffee, this is the answer to your prayers. But I wouldn't recommend the Dark French Roast - unless you take cream with your coffee.",4
B006N3I84I,"I recently bought a 50 pack of the Tully's Italian Roast K-cups and could not be more pleased w/ my purchased...all of the cups were intact, none were damaged and I have yet to experience any of them exploding in the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Shipping was rather quick and yes, they did come in a box, they were not in any type of holder inside the box but that was not an issue.<br /><br />For the $$$ I paid I found this purchase to be a very good value.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy this and enjoy great tasting coffee from your Keurig.",4
B003EML8PM,"I was sceptical at first but after I tried the first bag, I was hooked.  Very easy to prepare.  I microwave these for a minute and a half and they come out perfect.  Nice and salty.  Fresher than the ones you get in bags at the store.  The hardest part is waiting for them to cool.",5
B00153SSZU,Great dry cat food. Will definitely buy it again for my cat. He loved it and never got tired of it.,5
B000IHNCQO,"these are great and are definitely for those that love cheese. i personally love when cheese on pizza gets a little crispy around the edge. these are like a pack of just that. they are crunchy,salty and have great flavour.. they are a little oily but if ya set em on a paper towel for a bit it would absorb some of the oil.my kids love em too.",4
B002NHYQAS,"I'm more of a milk chocolate kind of person, so I didn't expect to like this, but it's actually very smooth and not bitter.<br />Since dark chocolate is so good for you, and milk chocolate, well, isn't, I was hoping I'd find a dark chocolate bar that didn't have a nasty bitter aftertaste. This meets that criteria!<br />The bars are small, but it's rich and satisfying, and all you really need, even for PMS. I can feel the grumpiness melt away, replaced by mild euphoria and a feeling of peace, contentment, and love for everyone. Chocolate is a miracle drug, and this particular one is high quality, good stuff.<br />DH knows that there are certain times he will need to throw one of these in ahead of him and run past and wait for the chocolate to kick in. He considers these a good investment, and I like the taste, texture and health benefits.<br />I feel much less guilty eating these than I would milk chocolate, or my beloved forbidden white chocolate.<br />I'm very satisfied with this product.",4
B0046GPEKA,"It should be noted that this is a ""crunchy"" style nut butter. Because of a health issue, I can't eat nuts or seeds. To get the benefits of nuts I get smooth, unsweetened, unsalted nut butters. Since there was no description given for this, I thought that anyone with my same health issue should know before ordering. Fortunately, my husband likes it, so it won't go to waste.",3
B001534R00,"Sure it tasted ok, but I drank it and about an hour later I had the worst reaction to this drink. My skin started flushing horrible and I began to itch. I felt like I was on COCAINE, and it gave me a panic attack! I am not kidding, I was extremely paranoid and had a hard time talking. It gave me a sore stomach all day and I completely lost my appetite. I went outside and the sun was intolerable, so weird. I puked twice from it. I have NO IDEA what they put in here, but it is not FDA approved and I would stay away from this. It's a non-approved dietary suppliment, look at what happened to people with metabolife! It killed people! It made me sick all day and I had to go to my friends house so they could watch me, because I live alone.",1
B001EO5Y70,I have received these as gifts. The originals that come from Turkey do not come sopped in sugar.<br />They are placed in a tray that resembles an ice tray. This product came wrapped in paper and tasted nothing like the ones I have had in the past. I unfortunately bought a 4 pack and had to give the other 3 packs away. They did not taste good at all.,1

B0026LN472,"I have had kitty on Natural Balance Chicken, Duck, and Salmon (salmon being the least favorite as far as taste) - I like to switch it up for her (who likes to eat the same crackers day in, day out?) and recently purchased the ultra formula (because she is a senior citizen at 15).<br /><br />Anyhow, her little 'gifts' to me since having her on the ultra formula have been the stinkiest little stink bombs I have ever experienced.

B001LG945O,"I _really_ like this drink.  My only complaint is that I'd need to drink 2-3 cans at a time -- 8.3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me.<br /><br />If it came in a 20oz can, I'd be much more likely to buy it, and the packaging would be much less costly.<br /><br />Really tasty product, though, and I've got no quarrels with the ingredients.  Yum.",4

B001HTC17S,"I tried this many years ago (same ingredients as they have now) and I really did want to like it because I know how bad regular wheat pasta if for me and I've been loving elbow macaroni since I was a kid and  hoped I could make my own mac and cheese out of this. But white rice also gives me tummy trouble and this is made mostly of white rice. But that's not the only reason I gave it just 2 stars. As I've said in my other bionaturae pasta reviews, if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. All of their pastas are made from the same ""formula"" (that's what they call it). And no matter how many times I've tried it, different types of pastas, different cooking times, they all taste chewy and sticky. The taste is not horrible but texture just ruins the entire eating experience.<br /><br />My full review is below.

They claim it has a true pasta-like texture. As an Italian-American from NY who has been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years, for me it does not have the ""true pasta-like"" texture as they claim. Like I said, sticky, chewy, tacky.<br /><br />> It felt like wet cement in my stomach. It made me constipated because it is not made from whole grains. And smothering it with my special melted cheese sauce didn't help any. It just made it heavier in my tummy.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But as I've mentioned in other reviews, poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it.

B001LGGH40,"I did not find this drink special in terms of taste; it is kiwi juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry. Carbonation makes the juice acidic and produces stronger effect on taste buds than the fruit juice.  It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors.

B003PFUNU4,This is a great amount for the money.  I didn't like the taste of sugar free though.  I'll be ordering the regular kind.,3
B00474G3EM,"First and foremost I will say that I was sorely disappointed with this item.  I purchased mine at World Market where I have previously had great success with another brand that they sadly no longer carry.  That previous brand was real tabouli.  This one was not.  Tabouli is made with Bulgar wheat.  This is couscous.  The packaging is very misleading.<br /><br />I only give this two stars because the finished product was edible, but not flavorful.  Moreover, in trying to follow the instructions for preparation, the first instruction says simply, ""empty package contents into bowl and add an equal amount of water.""  I tried to eyeball it and was able to come out with a decent guess at 1 1/2 cups.  Regardless, one shouldn't have to guess.  I will not buy this again.",2

B00141UC9I,"My dogs loved these treats!!  Recently my 9 yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick.  Couldn't keep anything down and after 3 days of this we went to pet emergency.  $1200.00 later it was concluded that it was something digested.  Not possible, I spare no expense when it comes to my 3 furry buddy's!  I grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough, MADE IN CHINA.  Went to FDA web site in 2012 and they said chicken from CHINA bad but no recalls yet.  DOGS have been getting sick from chicken products from china, advised not to buy.  Called company and no return call.<br />Trashed them all!!",1
B001EQ55ZO,Great concept but just way too much pepper. The combination would be perfect and this product would rate 5 stars if they just held back on the pepper by 50%.,3
B002AQLO4S,"I can not taste any flavoring in these, I put many drops into the water, increasing by increments and all it did was make the water sweet, there is no flavor here. I don't understand how others have tasted any flavoring at all because I sure didn't, I so wanted something all natural that would taste good but this is just drinking sugar water so now I have to find something to add some flavor to the water. These work well with tea, since there is no real flavor here you taste the tea and it makes it sweet enough.",2

B006Q7YFLQ,"OK, I have to say this is an expensive doggie treat, but my dogs practically steamroll one another to get to the treats. The circular disks of freeze dried chicken are rather big- bigger than a silver dollar and more than a half inch thick. They are very light because of the nature of the treat, and the dogs practically inhale them despite their size. I have 4 dogs and one is somewhat picky, but they all love these treats.<br /><br />There are under 20 treats in the package, so for $10-13 per package and with 4 dogs, they get about 4 treats a piece per package. And since these are treats, not bones, they don't last very long. I think these might be the ""Doggie Christmas Stocking"" type treat for special occasions, not an everyday treat due to the expense. But nonetheless, the dogs LOVE them!<br /><br />**4 stars due to price, but product gets 5 stars!",4
B001EQ5L0I,"Although i am very satisfied with other Rishi teas, this one smells like dead fish. It simply stinks. I could not even dare to take a sip to taste it. Maybe it is packed in a fish packing facility at China but this thing is undrinkable.",1

B002BCD2OG,"I am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels. My nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it's GI index is in the low 30's as opposed to honey in the low 50's and sugar in the mid-50's. I've tried supermarkets, health food stores and wholesale clubs. The prices are usually around $13 for a 32oz bottle and this is $19ish for 2x46oz. It's used like honey - substitute 2/3c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 1/4th.<br /><br />I also use it in a carrot cake recipe (equal substitution) instead of sugar where I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I don't decrease the other liquids. It's delicious and you'd never know that's it's actually good for you.",5
B001LM42JG,"I was very disappointed, when sending this to my sister as a gift, that three of the four cheeses she received were NOT the ones advertised.

B000H227BG,We appreciate the short list of ingredients on the Ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes.  The Chocolate Mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee.  This is one of our favorite cold weather drinks.,5

B004YV80O4,"Not that I was really expecting anything spectacular with this (in fact I think I ordered it on the vine program when I was hung over and in dire need of something heart stopping and liquor absorbing), but honestly, this is basically just Velveeta Shells and cheese with a little packet whatever spice it is that pasta dinner manufacturers add to give it that generic, pseudo ""kick"".  In short I was underwhelmed.  The original velveeta shells and cheese is pretty spectacular (that is, if you're in the market for something unspeakably unhealthy but infinitely comforting) and in my opinion, if it's not broke, don't fix it.",2
B000V6HQPA,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I buy the larger can of Campbells clam chowder at LEAST 8 times a month. I thought the subscribe and save would allow me to get smaller portions of the soup I love delivered to my door. This soup however IS NOT the Campell's clam chowder I enjoy. This is very runny, has no clams and very little potatoes. It is basically cream soup. It is awful that I am now stuck with 11 more can of this. I guess I will give it to the local food bank, but my subscribe and save has been canceled promptly. How is it possible for the larger cans I buy in the local grocery to be so much thicker and heartier than this? It is sad when you can't even count on trusted brands being consistent in quality.",1
B004K30HO2,"I recieved my DiposaKups and was a little disappointed.  First, they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail, however when I was tracking the product, it did say that it would take some time to deliver.  I have the Keurig Cuisinart, and the cups work ok, but they don't allow the machine to finish the brewing process.  It doesn't allow the hinge to completely close, which won't let the machine complete the brewing.  I have to take the cup out in order for it to finish.  HOWEVER, it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective, but I don't know that I would buy them again because I'm worried I may ruin my machine.",3
B007M83302,"NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",3

B007M83302,"I have tried original, BBQ and salt and vinegar. They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful. The salt and vinegar is a bit off, and it kind of has that ""hmm this taste like health food"". Which the BBQ doesn't have that effect at all. Though I'm still happy with my purchase. I have always been a fan of Popchips and always recommend my friends and family to eat this instead of their fried trans fatty chips.",4
B0058AMY74,"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it.""  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...",4
B00067ITNW,"Santanders 53% semi-sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion. The 65% is pretty good also, but it's more smooth and balanced, whereas the 53% is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor.<br /><br />I've tried their 53%, 65%, 70% and also their espresso 70% one - the 53% is the best (by a long shot), then the 65% comes in 2nd place. The others are very good too, but don't quite have the amazing overall rich/creamy wonderfulness of the 53% bar.<br /><br />If you are not sure which bar to buy, the 53% bar is an excellent choice. If you like See's candy and/or Godiva, then you'll be right at home with this bar. It's one of the single best dark chocolate bars I have ever had in my life.",5

B001E5DZTS,"Our little baby girl battled colic and reflux for nearly 6 weeks. She was unable to sleep because her little belly hurt - she would be 90% asleep when she would arch her back ad then scream in pain. Baby, mommy, and daddy were all miserable. After going through all the brands of formula (including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4"">Similac Alimentum Hypoallergenic Formula, Powder, Case of 6 Cans- each 1 lb (454 g)</a>) the doctor finally put her on goat's milk and Prilosec. I am not sure which was the bigger influence, but the quality of our lives is now significantly better.<br /><br />  The nice thing about the Meyenberg Goat Milk is that is easy to prepare just like regular formula. Liquid goat's milk must be kept in the refrigerator and must be warmed ... not too big of a deal except for those 3am feedings! Another nice thing about the Meyenberg powdered milk is that folic acid is added. Remember that if you choose to give goat's milk to your baby that you will need to give some supplemental vitamins. Our daughter seems to enjoy the taste - and as a bonus it does not have the nasty smell of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4"">Similac Alimentum Hypoallergenic Formula, Powder, Case of 6 Cans- each 1 lb (454 g)</a>.<br /><br />Final Verdict - So far... great... let's hope it continues!<br /><br />5 Stars",5

Bran is the nutritious cardboard part of a wheat grain. I personally would like to see them reduce the added sugar and add more raisins for a natural sweetness. As far a a amazon rating though it is, in my opinion, a good (not great) tasting cereal and has a good bit or fiber and protein. Also it's price is great for to the door delivery and you don't have to wait for it to go on sale at your local grocery store.",4
B00430B73W,Only one bad thing - the are a little large so basically that is almost 300 calories and of couse you cannot eat half because it is so tasty,4
B002BCE9JS,"This is my first review ever....I've been a Pho lover for years.....grant it I didn't expect this to be perfect....actually its so horrible I gagged...I wasn't sure if i was smelling the broth or the plastic from the container. I didn't even smell the star anise was non existent. Please, do yourself a favor and save your money do not purchase this product. Again, I did not expect this product to be great....I am not a picky person, but this stuff right here is just plain nasty. The only GOOD I can say is the noodles were of nice consistency.  I would really hate for someone to waste their money to buy this product. Now I have 5 containers I wouldn't even want to give away....",1
B004CLCEDE,"THe noodles were very rubbery & the texture was not at all like food. You could bury it in sauce to make it taste like food, but cant get away from the rubbery texture. I do not recommend this product.",2
B001RVFDOO,"I LUV me some POPCHIPS!!  These are great snack items.  I ordered a case, and passed them around my office.  Now everyone is addicted to these chips. I have not found anyone that did not like these chips...and they are healthier than the baked chips out there. YUMM!!",5
B000EGZ9AG,"We like all kinds of rice, especially brown and basmati.  This rice is very good, but not 5-star.  It arrived quickly and in very good condition, mostly due to the excellent packaging.  It is the amongst the FRESHEST rice we've ever purchased (and we've purchased from the source).  It has a wonderful taste and aroma.  After cooking several batches, both on the stove and in our Zoji Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, we like it, but find the texture to be just okay.  We've had better textured varieties in the past.  The grains are on the short side for ""long grain"" and they explode a little too much, even when we used less water.  It is very good, for brown rice; just not quite as good, for brown basmati.  We would buy it again, but not as our only source of brown basmati.",3
B00020UGN4,"I bought one box after reading the nice rating/reviews. My hubby gave it a so-so rating. I tasted it, and was ultimately disappointed. I felt that I had to write a review to tell others. The chocolate is simply okay, comparable to $10/lb chocolate I buy at local produce. But the fillings were horrible (most of them). Given it is $36/lb + $18 for shipping, I am sure I will never ever buy another one.",1
B000KV61FC,"I bought this for my 4 month old Frenchie and he just seems absolutely disinterested in it lol. The way the bottle is shaped along with the rope it's almost ""by accident"" that the treats come out. He plays with it for about 5 minutes but then goes back to his IQ TREAT BALL that I also bought on Amazon. I feel like you have to basically flip this bottle upside down and mess with the rope for it to come out and I don't see Jackson being able to do that. If the bottle is laying flat as in the picture, how does the treat come up the neck and out the hole? He does grab the rope and run around with the bottle but I can tell this is not his most favorite toy.",3
B004K30HO2,I purchased this product to be able to use my own coffee and tea in the Keurig. The product does what it says. The only drawback that I can tell exists is the expensive shipping. I'd also like to have some suggested measurements for coffee and tea to fill the cup. Perhaps a section on their website where people can just start recording their experiences with different amounts of product... Just my 2 cents.,4
B004A6F0Z0,This is a great intro to Bonsai for beginners.  Product arrived in excellent condition.  Nice packaging. Quality product.  I placed a second order from Eve's Garden immediately folowing this one.,5
B000XSJLW2,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.",2
B003SZIISU,I love this tea. I have used it to help with dieting. It defiantly cleanses you so for those who have sensitive colons I would not recommend it. I was pregnant and then nursing and just was able to start using this again and after 2 days I already feel better! The taste isn't all that great but I usually just make it with ice and sip it down fast :) If you are looking for a cleanse or help with weight loss this is the stuff for you!,4
B004SRH2B6,"I don't know if it's the plastic bottle or the fact that it's made from concerntrate, but something doesn't taste right about Zico.  I ordered many different brands and most, if not all of them were not made from concentrate.  This tastes diluted, re-constituted and plastic-y.  There are many other brands, I recommend any one of them over Zico.",1
B001RVFDOO,"Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ, Original, Salt & Vinegar and Sour cream & onion chips are superb!",5
B006VRTR0K,"Tully's French Roast is my favorite morning coffee. This supply is unusually bitter.  Since I have been buying locally in smaller quantities, I feel I have been dumped upon with old product in this purchase - and will likely toss it. Advice:  buy nearer home and check ""use by"" dates.  This box comes with loose K-cups inside and no date whatsoever.",1
B004CT1NCY,"This is by far the best TASTING sleep drink I've had. In fact, I find myself frequently wishing they made a ""non drowsy"" formula so I could sip it during the day, it's really that good! However, if you're a full blown insomniac (such as myself) looking for 8 hours of sleep in a bottle, this may not be for you. It's great if you need to catch a long nap, like 3-4 hours, but if you're looking for a full night's sleep I recommend Neurosleep! A little pricier, but that will take you out for a good 7-8 hours.",3
B001EQ4P2I,I discovered that this particular flavor wakes me right up for the long drive home after dark.,4
B0093NILCY,"We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.",2
B001E6IZVU,Why would anyone purchase a box of cereal for $4-6$ or more. It is much cheaper at your local store. This site should feel embarrassed of the prices.,1
B0017SZJA0,"You can't go wrong with these flavorful wafers for a snack.  They make many flavors, but these are the dark chocolate kind, which can make you feel healthy.  After all, dark chocolate is especially good for you with antioxidants and stuff, right?  Well, we'll at least pretend that they are. While these aren't the best cookie in the world, they are good enough to make you eat half a can in one sitting as I can attest to.<br /><br />They would be great dipped in milk but I don't even need that to start an eating binge. The filling is nice and creamy chocolate while the wafers are crunchy and go together fantastically.  I suppose they would go nice with coffee, but I don't like coffee so I can't attest to that.<br /><br />They come in a metal tin (recyclable!)that is sealed and has an additional sealed bag on the inside for freshness. The serving size suggests 2 sticks per serving and that comes to about 100 calories with 4g being the total fat.  Good news is, there's no trans fat in these. Ingredients include: wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil (palm kernel oil, coconut oil, peanut oil), reduced fat cocoa powder, soy flour, malted barley flour, rice flour, cornstarch, whey (milk), soy lecithin, salt, vanilla, caramel color, natural flavors.  Allergy advisory is that this product contains wheat, soy, milk, and peanuts.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011",4
B0015PJ83Y,"This order arrived in a timely fashion and was well packed, but when I opened the box, I found all the gummi bears had melted together in one big lump within the 12 individual packages. I didn't think gummi bears would melt, but believe me, they will. Each bag contained one big colorful mass of gummis. My grandchildren ate the gummis anyway, after I took a knife and chopped the lumps into smaller pieces. The candies were harder and tougher than other gummis, but I could not tell you if that is normal or a result of the melting. As to taste, who can say when you are eating a combination of flavors in every bite. I do live in Texas and the weather is hot, but not unreasonable this time of year. I will not be ordering anymore perishables from Amazon, ever.",2
B001EHDMY4,The flavor is very mild.  We tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant.  Would not purchase again.,3
B0016JJEFG,"We drink a lot of tea... from all over the world! By far this is the worst tasting tea we have had... I purchased this based on reviews and because this is organic. When compared to st dalfour organic tea... this tastes like Lipton caffeine free tea from Costco! I HAVE always gone with reviews before buying anything online, but this particular tea is no good, At ALL. And Costco returns is better than amazon for so much of something so bad!",1
B004391DK0,"We LOVE the new gluten free Bisquick! I used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance. Now, we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what I can tell allergen free. The only thing I would like better (General Mills-if you are listening-I know I am not the only one that wants this) is if it came in bulk packaging. Just put the GF Bisquick in a larger box like the regular Bisquick and then sell in a 3 or 6 pack. Just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe GM will listen! LOVE THIS-ORDER NOW!!",5
B008S5KZ9K,"I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top. The recipe called for 1/4 c of the oil. Unfortunately, I was unable to remove the plastic top which does not unscrew.  It just has a flip top cap with a single hole in it and ended up just shaking it by drops into the measuring cup which was messy and a hassle.",3

B000WG5AX4,"When I ordered this from Always Direct the gum shell was very hard and crumbly and had somewhat of a chalky taste and the flavor lasted for about 5 seconds of a chew once I got through the hard and crumbly shell. FYI for bubble gum lovers: when the outer shell of the gumball starts to crumble off the gum itself, that's when you know ITS OLD!!!",1
B0017T1LI8,My husband and I love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis.,5

B0016B7Z32,I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.,2

B001RVFDOO,"I hate healthy anything!<br /><br />But I am overweight, so I need an alternative to my normal routine of Doritos potato chips. The only reason I tried these chips is because of the other reviews, so I am contributing my 5 stars toward the product.<br /><br />From just looking at it, I was expecting it to taste more like rice cake... but I was pleasantly surprise. The chips tastes great, very crisp... I don't really know how to explain it.<br /><br />All the flavors are great. My favorite is the BBQ. The Original is a bit too salty, but still very tasty.<br /><br />Highly recommended! At least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack.",5
B001RVFDOO,Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco. An 18 pack is only $7.89 at Costco.,3
B001LG945O,"100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't is proudly emblazoned upon the can that contains Switch's Orange Tangerine carbonated juice. It certainly tasted all-natural, as there wasn't too much taste really.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was all right, but I would say it tasted kind of like Sprite with a couple of orange flavored Alka-Seltzers tossed in. Another note is that it is rather small at only just over 8 ounces. However, it still had enough orange taste I suppose, so if you want an all-natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink, then you've just hit the jack-pot!<br /><br />If not, you may want to pass this up, mildly recommended.",3
B00286KM8E,I found the quality of tea inconsistent. I think it is a Lipton issue rather than anything to do with Amazon.<br /><br />I have had one experience like this with store-bought Lipton tea bags before.

B000FPM2PG,"When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has ""organic"" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product ""does not have harmful levels of mercury.""  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish.",1
B00622CYVS,"We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the ""regular"" brands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn't get in another brand.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn't eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They're runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it.<br /><br />I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.<br /><br />Earth's Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) it's a wash.<br /><br />If you want to use Earth's Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips:<br />*Visit Earth's Best's website and print off all the coupons they'll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same<br /><br />*Buy at Whole Foods.  They have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discount<br /><br />*You can also buy them by the case at Meijers for less than $10.00, cheaper than here!",4
B000AYDGZ2,"While these bars were a good ""deal"" versus the supermarket price, I was pretty disappointed to find that the expiration date on the individual packages is May of this year.  Normally, you would find a much further out date.  I believe these were overstocked and dumped onto customers via Amazon.  They also are kind of dry and hard versus ones I purchased at the supermarket, likely for the same reason.  My kids didn't like them, either, even when we went on a roadtrip and they were the only thing in the car to eat-- that's saying a lot! I ended up throwing them all away. Obviously don't recommend.",2
B000I4T8YW,"Not bad for a canned dessert. I used some whipped cream because it was a little dry.<br /><br />I was surprised upon opening this that the inside of the can isn't lined. I think some can flavor may have leached into the taste, affecting the flavor (or is that ""flavour""?)",3

Odd.  When I let Amazon know, they refunded my entire purchase price.  Bad product, good customer service.

I have no idea what they did to this version but the taste is horrible and very noticeable when you've had the version I've mentioned above.  It's edible, but so are some varieties of garbage, not recommended.",2
B000UXA3L8,"I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.",5

The K cups would not empty, would overflow, and would make only 1/2 the amount recommended.  Keurig would say ""prime"" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re-priming my Keurig.

They are WAY better than what I was getting at my local whole food store in bulk.

Unfortunately the bottles appeared to have frozen during shipping -- some still had ice chunks inside when I opened the box. Even worse, some had leaked, making the box bottom sticky and soggy. Most of the bottles were fine, but a few were flat when opened, probably from being frozen. I'd look for cans instead of bottles if I ordered them again; I suppose they could lose their fizz too, but at least it would avoid the soggy mess.<br />As for the flavor (which was new to me), it was better than I expected - definitely a recognizable celery component, but in a pleasant way.",2

The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.

B004YV80OE,"First of all, to call this a ""Chicken and Broccoli Skillet"" is two-thirds wrong.  There is no chicken - you have to add it - and the broccoli is akin to fine print in a cell phone contract.  Maybe it should have been called ""Chicken Tasting Skillet with Broccoli Coloring.""<br /><br />Packaging, preparation, and cooking are all simple enough to satisfy the lazy parent, the overzealous latch-key kid, and the agoraphobic nerd on a 72-hour <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0HKIU"">World of Warcraft</a> bender.  Those interested in nutrition, the love of cooking, or anything with a semblance of non-processed would be best to steer clear.  Lucky for me I steamed some broccoli and saut&eacute;ed some chicken to ""complete"" the meal.<br /><br />What the Velveeta skillet does have going for it is Velveeta and portion size.  There is no mistaking the quintessential Velveeta texture that could make billy-goat puke tolerable.  The supplementary benefit of this particular blend is that it can be used to spackle walls and caulk bathrooms...if you're into that neon-orange, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZSTGIC"">Tennessee Volunteers</a>, garbage-man convention sort of color scheme.  Regarding portion size, I ate for three consecutive days, and was ""blocked"" for the day following.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably not a product I'd buy.  The taste wasn't appealing enough to overcome the shortfalls.  Big fans of Velveeta will probably love it, but I'd rather have Hamburger Helper mixed with Mac'n Cheese.",3

B003DKY5R8,"I purchased a Keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for breakfast instead of making a French press full and pitching half of it.  I use it to make unsweetened iced tea.  With the plethora of sweetened iced tea k-cups, it's great to have one with the good, clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea.  I use the largest setting and then add about 1/2 cup of cold water to the Pyrex liquid measuring pitcher.  With the addition of water, it cuts the strength to the proper consistency.  I don't bother with all the glasses with ice and then brewing over ice.  I just make the tea and pour it from the pitcher.  Good stuff.",5
B004DBXK8G,"This item is really Season's brand of hearts of palm, not Asian Harvest.  Nevertheless, they are awful.  Extremely woody and very hard to chew on the outside layer, tender in the middle, with a terrible bitter aftertaste.  There are distributed by Manischewitz, a generally reliable vendor of food products.  This, however, is a travesty!  The comparison between these and the brand carried occasionally by Costco, SunPix, is like night and day.  SunPix are tender, smooth, and taste great.  These are the exact opposite.",1
B002IYT3MW,"These tomatoes sounded great because they have no additives or preservatives. They were delivered very quickly, and are a dull brown color, which I expected because of the lack of sulfites.  Unfortunately, they are extremely bitter, and even though I expected the flavor to improve when I rehydrated them with water, they retained the bitterness. I tried soaking them in olive oil as well, and this also did not do much to improve the flavor.  Amazon advertises these as sun dried but in fact, they are not sun dried and are air dried instead.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the flavor, and I was unable to find out any other information about the company, Sonoma. Therefore, I would not recommend these tomatoes. :(",2
B000CQG8K8,"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one.",1

B001TM711E,"This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.",3

I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way.

B000634IIG,"Soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure (Yes, she ate all the foods on that recall list), my Westie became ill and couldn't hold any food. The vet did all sorts of tests, but I had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down. That night I met a rep from Nutro at my local Petco. She told me all about Natural Choice, gave me literature and a website to learn more. I purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it. Turns out the dog had some sort of virus, but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength. Due to skin allergies known to Westies, I have kept him on this food and find it's the best for him.<br /><br />I just don't understand, though, how this is sold so cheap on Amazon thru Petco. It's $16.99/case in the store and $15.99 on their website.  I think they should keep the price regulated throughout.",5

Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.

I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this.  I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time.

B001E5E0I8,"These Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes are really very tasty, maybe the best I've tried so far but I was surprised to see how small these packages really are. That is entirely my own fault for not paying closer attention to the weight ~ these bags are only 3 ounces each, hardly two servings worth of dried mango per package. Considering the price, they aren't the best value in dried fruit but nevertheless they are still yummy. The pieces are quite small and rather bite-sized. The fruit is very sweet, soft and moist ~ not hard and shoe-leathery like some other dried mango products. They have been organically grown (although it states nowhere on the package that they are unsulphured like other Made In Nature fruits) and they are a product of Mexico or Ecuador.<br /><br />So I give Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes, 3-Ounce Bags an overall 4 stars ~ 5 stars for quality, 3 stars for value.",4
B001BDDTB2,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity.

B004N66R6I,"In February 2012, I bought these treats while traveling for my 10lbs dog.  I chose them because they seemed fairly healthy, and all of the ingredients were something easily recognizable.  After a week of giving him these (following the feeding instructions), he got violently ill.  He went outside to potty and collapsed on the deck on the way back into the house.  He deficated while lying on his side.  I called him to me, he got up and slowly made his way to me before falling over again.  When I picked him up, his head was lolling from side to side and he couldn't keep his eyes open.  I went to grab my shoes and purse while my mom looked up the closest emergency vet.  That's when he began vomiting.<br /><br />By the time we were seen at the vet hospital, his vitals were retuning to normal.  I explained what had happened and they said he'd probably had a seizure.  After checking him out, they said that he seemed fine, but asked what he'd been eating, was it possible that he'd gotten into a pesticide, etc.  At the time, I couldn't think of anything.  When we retuned from our trip, I took him to our regular vet and they did a work up on him.  They didn't find anything.  A couple of weeks later I was watching the news, and when they mentioned that the next story was about dog treats making pets sick, I knew.  I didn't immediately remember the brand name, but after looking up the type and look of the package, I knew it was Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good.  To confirm, I called my mom and made her pull out the package.  I was right.  These treats we're the ONLY thing different in his diet.<br /><br />I am thankful that he only had an acute attack from these and not something chronic or worse.  I am going to write a letter to the Neslte pet division, to their CEO, CFO, board of directors, anyone, to let them know that they are making pets sick and worse.  They should be ashamed of themselves",1

B000PDY3P0,"I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted ""movie theater"" or ""carnival/fair"" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet.

Very refreshing taste and not over powering with no additives; what a plus.  nice carry size, but why should such a good thing be in such a small size.  Good that the product is in a can - recyclable.  there are other similar carbonated-juice out there and this is definitely one that could compete with the low-saturated market.",5
B001LG945O,"There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those ""single shot"" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.",3

And now I have, which is why Amazon is the best! These are packaged exactly the way I remember, same box, same wrappers. I got it in two days with Prime and the package was perfect, no nicks or tears.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I find these to be a bit sweeter than I remember. It could just be me, but I was sure I'd recognize the flavor accurately. Though that's a little disappointing, they still taste really good and smell as awesome as ever. My fiance (who had never tried them before) now loves them too.",4

These travel pretty well and do give you a bit of volume so you don't feel hungry but they are far from being a healthy food choice.",2
B001LG945O,I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.,5

B0017U24LA,"Like many high-carbohydrate instant ""soups,"" the Lentil Couscous Soup is more couscous than soup.  Preparation is easy, although mine boiled over when prepared according to the very precise (1 minute, 40 seconds) cooking time in the instructions.  I would have preferred a more vague time endpoint and directions to watch for boiling.  The resulting food is quite bland as other reviewers have noted, and what this ""low-sodium"" (330 mg) soup really needed was more salt.  The flavors that were present were nondescript, neither the couscous nor the lentils providing a distinctive flavor note.  I kept looking at the package to see what kind of flavor I should have been expecting.  The texture was also pretty monotonous, and the couscous itself did not have the best texture, which was disappointing because good couscous is not that hard to make.  As for healthy eating, the product is essentially pasta with lentils added to provide some protein and fiber, and with 37 grams of carbs the 190 calories are pretty empty -- not all that much different from macaroni with low-fat cheese.  I'm glad I tried it, I won't mind eating the other 5 cups in the pack, but I won't be buying it again.",2

B001E6KBSK,"On a trip to Italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and I loved it.  Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog's sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />""Real"" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend ""time-to-mushiness."")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the ""fruit flakes""), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.",2

B003H7YHUW,"There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with...",3

She used a blender with chipped ice and it was smooth; at home, when I tried to use it in hot chai (as shown on box), it clumped up and wouldn't mix in.

If you are going to use it as just a drink, you might try using a half of a packet, but you could also add a whole one to a pitcher of ice tea and still have a nice ginger flavor. I would think that it would also be great to clear out your sinuses. Since many people use ginger for an upset stomach or an aid to digestion, it would be great to make a drink for that purpose. It comes in 6.72 ounce boxes and a pack of 6 for $22.69 on Amazon. I gave it a four star, as it may be too strong for people who do not particularly care for the strong ginger flavor.",4

All three have worked just fine as if I had plugged them into a mixer or a PA system, no problems. I have also beaten the crap out of this thing, knocked it around way too much and left it on the floor at my desk where I record, no problems still runs fine and it's not showing any signs of stopping. This thing is also super easy, plug and record on any software including the free Audacity software, Garage Band, and Sony Acid (the three I've tested)<br />One problem, that gain knob, while very useful, is super super touchy. I found a volume I liked and then taped it down, otherwise it'll jack up or down the gain with the slightest jostling. Doesn't make this a bad product, it just means have some tape handy and this is a quick and easy solution especially for podcasters who don't want to be limited to the USB microphones and don't want to shell out big money for a USB compatible mixer.",4

We haven't found Eight O'Clock in California so I'm really thankful that Amazon sells it.",4
B001BDDTB2,"My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge.",4

B0090X8IPM,"Because your baseline tastes may well differ from mine, here's where I'm coming from: I'm not a fan of artificially flavored coffees, but I do like an occasional shake of cinnamon or cocoa in my coffee--and a pinch of cardamom is awesome. I do like Starbucks coffee--some people say it tastes burnt, though, or is over-roasted. I take my coffee black or with cream, and only occasionally add some Splenda -- I don't ""do"" sugar. I dislike the ""Bailey's Irish Cream""/butter pecan/you name it -flavored-type coffees--they taste of artificial flavors to me, and the quality of the coffee isn't that good. So I set out to try the new Starbucks ground ""naturally"" flavored coffees...<br /><br />Well, this was rather disappointing. I know that ""natural flavors"" doesn't necessarily mean ""natural vanilla flavor""-- all it means is that the flavorings are derived from plants and not petroleum--could well be from pine trees. This coffee lists in order the following ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root. .... Now, we don't know what the ""natural flavors"" are, but they are something different from ground vanilla beans, and listed before them. The sarsaparilla root is kind of weird too-- sarsaparilla, the beverage, tastes like root beer! Well, this has that ""artificially flavored coffee"" taste--smells and tastes a lot like Bailey's Irish Cream flavored coffee, although the underlying coffee is much better than you might get from a supermarket brand of flavored coffee--it's Starbucks, after all.  I put Splenda in mine, as well as cream--not very pleasant on its own.<br /><br />On the plus side, you can control how sweet you make it, and use the sweetener you prefer--but why not just put a glug of natural vanilla extract or some ground vanilla beans in your regular coffee yourself? That way your coffee maker doesn't get all flavored up, either.<br /><br />and--it's not the 3/4 lb. (12 oz)  bag you might have become accustomed to (remember when all coffee came in a full pound bag?) --it's only 11 oz!! I guess they think we aren't paying attention.",2
B004YV80O4,"It's like Hamburger Helper, easy to prepare, fast, heck a child could make it.  And honestly, as far as taste goes...I'm sure children will like it. It really tastes like a cheeseburger.  In a bowl.  With pasta.  Maybe I'm just not used to it but, as a cheese lover I thought I'd love it.  It's only okay.  You get the feeling it tastes like a cheeseburger but, somehow that doesn't translate as well when it's in a skillet scooped into a bowl.  It's a worthy alternative to the instant meals since the Velveeta cheese is indeed...cheesy.  Somehow I just couldn't get into it.",3
B001LG945O,"It's a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but that's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. It's made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but it's almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that's fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so that's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />So it can't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldn't go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasn't a big fan and personally I'm going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer.",3

B0090X8IPM,"I am a Starbucks junkie, gold card holder who gets either a mocha frappuchino or if it's a chilly day a simple mocha.  So I was thrilled to try a bag of their coffee at home.  Since I was in charge of the coffee maker down at Thanksgiving, I brought both this bag and a bag of decaf for the Grandmas.  I made the first pot when I arrived and was unhappy with how bitter it was, I had been expecting at least a vanilla aroma but there was no vanilla to be discerned in either the scent or taste.  Also when I looked into the bag, it the color of the grounds was far lighter than most of the coffees I make, and the grinds had what appeared to be wood chips in them (now I know that they weren't actually wood chips, but that's what they looked like.)  We drank several more pots of this coffee over the next few days as it was the only coffee that I'd brought, the volume of creamer and sweetner consumed had increased over the next several days.  It was simply too bitter, and did not have an attractive flavor.  I was very disappointed as there are very few Starbucks products that I don't care for - but this falls into that category.  It appears that I will still be brewing Dunkin Donuts coffee at home.  Currently at the price of thirteen dollars for two this is actually a good price should this coffee be to your taste.",2
B003LJB8RQ,I was really disappointed in this product. Tastes like any cheap instant coffee. My favorite is Starbucks Via but was looking for a product where I was able to choose how much to use ie. if I only had time for a small cup vs. time to relax & enjoy a large cup. 8-(,2
B000PDY3P0,"We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product.  The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad.",1
B001EQ5AK4,"This good maple syrup, in medium amber, the most popular grade.  It's from Vermont, which has slightly more stringent standards about maple syrup density.  Thus I was surprised that this Highland Sugarworks syrup was weaker than the L.L. Bean syrup I was about to run out of.  But reading the label provides a clue to my disappointment.  It's labeled ""Pure NEW ENGLAND Maple Syrup"", as opposed to ""Pure VERMONT Maple Syrup"".  The reverse of the label says ""We also purchase syrup from our friends and neighbors"".  (The L.L. Bean container says ""Packed in Vermont"".)  So I conclude that this is rated on the (weaker) U.S. scale rather than the Vermont scale.<br /><br />It's still good syrup; it just seems a bit ""watered-down"" compared to what I expected.",4

B005HI55CS,"Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.",2

(Two statements, connected by an asterisk) Seemed<br />unclear.<br /><br />Before rinsing, CLEAR's goopy consistency made me doubt its sticky white lather could get past the hair (not really a lather; no frothy bubbles). The consistency is like a women's facial creme. I took pictures of my frothy Gorgon-Head scary-odd hair. Pretty funny, kinda scary.<br /><br />I tried finger tips to rub the glop into my scalp. Maybe some got through my hair, but its heavy-consistency turned hair follicles into slimy protrusions like bright white heavy meringue; sticky and thick like tooth paste; both funny and weird. I tried rubbing it into my scalp; it just glopped together in my hair. Afterwards I had to wash my hands twice. The white stuff that couldn't get past hair covered my fingers, palms.<br /><br />My hair doesn't have observably more volume; after drying, the hair seemed sort of frizzed; literally less shiny, healthy.

It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.

B004TPUT9Y,"**<br />I would only recommend this ""meal"" to people who enjoy junk food and fast food and who are going to eat it anyway. The good things about this mac and cheese cup are that it tastes pretty good, it is convenient and easy to fix, and there are no dishes. If you want a little taste of fast food (220 calories), but don't want to leave the house, have money to spend and care nothing about nutrition, you've found a terrific product.<br /><br />The negative things:<br />(1) It is super-high in carbohydrates at 40g per 220 calorie serving. Definitely to be avoided if you are diabetic or are pre-diabetic or don't want to be.<br />(2) It is high in sodium at 670mg for just those 220 calories--yikes!<br />(3) The ingredients list is long and reads like a chemical formula. If this is what you eat anyway, you might not care. But if you're used to real food, it does have a kind of synthetic odd off taste to it. I liked it initially, but it lingered with me for a while afterwards and I had to keep drinking water to wash the aftertaste away.<br />(4) It is mostly white rice flour, corn syrup solids (sugar), and fake cheese. Please don't feed this to your children. Whatever you do.<br />(5) As mentioned above, terrible for nutritive value--no nutrition whatsoever besides calcium (6% of your daily requirement) and iron (8% of your daily requirement). No other vitamins or minerals.<br /><br />Only recommended if you're already used to fast food and junk food and if you also don't care one bit about nutrition. I gave it two stars because if you're that type of person anyway, it's not a bad choice as at least you're not getting the gluten. You're not getting anything else either except empty calories, but if you can handle the chemically aftertaste, you might upgrade your diet by avoiding the gluten.<br />**<br />**",2

B000EH0RU2,"This was my second purchase of this product, my husband likes to eat healthy and loves this rice blend.<br />Will place another order soon, if you enjoy wild rice you will enjoy it, we can't find it in our local supermarkets any more, so I order here.",4
B003VXFK44,This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with.,5
B0012YEKCW,"The packet of these seeds that I received must have been old because I don't believe even 10% of them grew. I tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. I garden regularly (I live in Florida) so it's not that I don't know how, and I even followed the instructions to the letter, but they did not grow.",1
B000S83R2M,I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.,1
B0029NUYZW,"I have the subscription for the lamb & chicken for my 9 & 13 year old Rat Terriers. I have found the products are inconsistent in gravy and meats. One shipment was so dry I had to add water to have a gravy. The last lamb shipment was mostly gravy & less meat. I would prefer the weight be made up of meat & not all gravy. But, the pups love it! As senior dogs I have noticed their breath & digestion is much healthier then when on dry foods that are mostly corn & wheat.",4
B001IZM92S,I threw both bags out. Wasted $18 plus dollars. They were not fresh. I felt like I was chewing on cardboard. Don't waste your money.,1
B00110JI4M,This product makes it sound healthy having 50% whole grains in the pasta however the part that everyone should be aware of is the 3.5g of trans fat. Trans fat is chemically made to prolong the shelflife of products and it is not good for ur health. Eating this each day is unhealthy due to the enormous amount in each serving. I suggest buying one that contains 0 or at minimal .5g trans fat if u must.,1
B000KSVLG4,"Well we finally ""bit the bullet"" and ordered a burr coffee grinder from Amazon. We decided to get some of this coffee to start out our home grinding experience. Yesterday morning, the mailman arrived with our package. We have brewed 4 pots so far.<br /><br />First, no complaints about the caffeine. You can get quite a buzz on a couple of cups. And the beans are beautiful.<br /><br />It is not bitter or acidic - it's nice & smooth. I was disappointed with the the almost total lack of the wonderful aroma noted by other reviewers, though. It just seems to lack any outstanding flavor or character. Tastes similar to many better grocery store blends I have used in the past. Although my wife liked it better than I did, when asked if she would buy it again - she said: ""Probably not.""<br /><br />I'm not encouraged to try any of their other blends based on this experience. We will probably stick with Howe's, which is sold at our grocer. At least you can smell it before buying.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were just too high.",3
B000F6SNPS,"I have been getting the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine-Free tea for several months now on a subscription (pack of 6), and usually drink two to three tea bags a night. I don't know when they changed the tea to include 'Natural and Artificial' flavors, but the taste of the tea I got in July has totally changed for the worse, and I can't drink it! The only way I can describe the way it tastes is that it reminds me of burnt wiring. I opened up a second box (of the six) and tried one of tea bags in that box, and it's the same thing: it's undrinkable.<br /><br />I am really bummed out, because it was my favorite tea. Unfortunately, it can't be returned, so I've got boxes of the tea that I can't drink.<br /><br />I may try a box of the Organic Caffeine-Free version, but from the reviews it doesn't sound like it's got as much flavor as the Original blend.",1
B006N3IG4K,"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things. But I really like the blend of flavors. To me it doesn't really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical-ness in general. It's like.. palm tree flavored coffee. And the flavor isn't too overpowering at all, it still has a nice coffee taste. It's just right.",5
B001M074MY,"This coffee .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0508Y"">Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)</a> is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee.",1
B00284TR82,"MORE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE PACKING BOX ARE LEAKING OUT, AT LEAST 10 OF THE SINGLE SERVE PACKAGES LEAK OUT IN THE BOX. WITH ALL THE CREAMERS I HAVE ORDERED THROUGH YOU HAVE PACKAGES THAT HAVE LEAKED ALL OVER THE BOX. I AM LOOKING AT OTHER SOURCES FOR MY PRODUCT.",2
B005CUU25G,"I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.",2
B002L3RVBA,"These do the job, although you have to keep blotting on a napkin in between to get the ink out.  Once you do, it works fine.",3
B00355CPSM,These are so tasty I use them when making my cheesecake cookies and in pancakes there's nothing that they can't be used in. They taste sweet and not overpowering.,5
B000SP1CWW,"This is a great product to use for a treat in the kong toy. I found it a little cheaper at the pet store, but online it goes for the same price at most places when I was doing a price comparison. Also, it's great to not have to go out and buy it when you can just receive it in the mail! My dog will love this for Christmas in her stocking.",4
