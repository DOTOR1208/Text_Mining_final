B0076FJ7SS,"three sizes to choose to round the corners of tags, pages etc. love this tool",5
B0076FJ7SS,I gave a bad review to a cheaper model so only fair to say this one is awesome and was not much more $. Nice that it has a catcher for the edges when you clip the corner. .,5
B0CRHF41F7,My son needed black shorts to wear to his daily football workouts during the school year. These have worked wonderfully for him. They get washed OFTEN and are holding up well.  He is 5'10 and weighs about 150 and they fit him well.,5
B0CRHF41F7,The shorts were a better quality than I expected and fit just right and for the price I think it's a great deal. I've been using them for a few weeks now with no issues at the gym,5
B0CRHF41F7,This product runs a bit on the small size. The legs are tight. The material seems good and well-made.,3
B0CRHF41F7,"The size was great , we'll they're shorts , so they don't keep a person warm ... I  use them for walking every day , Quality is nice , MY wife and  I  loved the colors ...",5
B0CRHF41F7,These athletic shorts were just what we were looking for my husband. He just had knee surgery and he was looking for something comfortable that he could do his physical therapy in. The material is a great quality,5
B0CRHF41F7,"These shorts are comfortable, appear to be good quality, and are light without being see-through. The pocket capacity is sufficient to hold a cell phone, wallet, and keys.",5
B0CRHF41F7,They are plain . Nothing great and nothing bad. Good material. Arrived before anticipated date.,4
B0CRHF41F7,"This is my second purchase of these shorts. First one for me, second for my father-in-law. I stronger recommend these shorts for all.",5

B0CRHF41F7,"Light, comfortable, fit well.",5
B0CRHF41F7,"The only thing these are ""missing"" is a brand name on them somewhere, brand name quality without the price.  So if you can get over not being a billboard buy them!!  Purchased for my son for extra shorts to throw in his practice duffle but I have found that he prefers these over alot of his other name brand shorts.",5

B0CRHF41F7,"I ordered these for my husband to lounge around in and he really loves them! They are super comfortable and they actually look pretty nice so he wears them out running errands as well. The only issue I have found is that if you do not tie the strings prior to washing the shorts, the string will come out of the shorts and it is a pain to thread it back through.",5
B0CRHF41F7,Got them for my husband for gym,5
B0CRHF41F7,Comfy,5

B0CRHF41F7,"Got these short to work out in, seem fine so far",4
B0CRHF41F7,Good value for price.,4
B0CRHF41F7,"Great buy. I love the fit, softness, and the deep pockets. A few months ago I lost my wallet in a supermarket. Fortunately, the guy who found it went through the store to find me and refused a reward, which I tried and would have been happy to reward him. Those were nice shorts but I realized the pockets were not deep. I checked all my short's pockets after that. Some were deep but only the heavy material shorts. These are the type of shorts I need for Florida summers. Now I can go shopping without worrying about losing my wallet.",5
B0CRHF41F7,"They were just what I expected, decent shorts and decent value",5
B0CRHF41F7,This are a perfect for what I wanted.,5

B0CRHF41F7,Cooler to wear,5
B0CRHF41F7,My husband loved them,5
B0CRHF41F7,Nice fabric,4
B0CRHF41F7,"Had these now for a couple of weeks and they are holding up well so far, nice and thick material so they aren't see through, the fit is good, would say it's slightly bigger than the size stated but they have plenty of stretch which is great",4
B0CRHF41F7,Not a fan of the shiny material but that is just personal preferancee.  Fit well and light weight,4
B0CRHF41F7,They are very well made,5
B0CRHF41F7,Light weight  good sizing,5
B0CRHF41F7,Se ven bien y son de buena calidad,4
B0CRHF41F7,These are little small,4
B0CRHF41F7,"These are actually some fairly good pants. Yes they are lightweight and seem easy to get dirty, but construction quality is decent and very much worth the price paid for them! The ones I received ran true to size,",4
B0CRHF41F7,Good for the price,4
B0CRHF41F7,Bought for my husband has good length down to his knees he says he really likes them and that they are comfortable,5
B0CRHF41F7,Wish they had a pocket in the back,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The shirt is very comfortable to wear in resect to fabric, seams, and sizing. The OD green is a nice tone, suitable for camping or light tactical uses. Fabric is light weight, breathable, and could be comfortably worn under body armor or load bearing vest. The only ""negative"" would be that the short sleeves were about 2"" too long per my personal preferences. My dress shirt long sleeve measurements are 32/33"". I am a size 48-50"" chest, 5'8"", 235 lb and the size 2XL is a great fit. Would buy again.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I really enjoy the shirt I ordered. Its nice and slim fitting, it breaths fantastic when wind picks up. The build quality is also there, feels great in the hand and after a few washes it remains unshrunk. The one problem I have with this shirt is you can really tell its polyester. Not a big deal but after you work in the heat it can start to smell a bit worse than a cotton blend would",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Fits great; excellent value-- functional sleeve -pen pocket and sunglasses'  loop-- excellent colors and wash n wear-- no iron needed,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"This shirt was purchased as a gift, for someone who has trouble finding a proper fitting style due to their size. The color and the material was perfect, the fit was neither tight not loose. The shirt is made of quality material that is not too thick or thin making it a great shirt for causal activities. Very versatile shirt for warm or cold weather.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,The weave of the polyester is rough and thicker than other similar shirts.  It's much warmer in comparison to a similar Under Armour shirt.,3
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Makes for a great work polo. The pockets on the sleeve and the sunglasses loop on the chest are really convenient. The shirt is comfortable and fits true to size. Sleeve length hits your arm at just the right spot. These are my new go to work shirts. They wash really well. I always hang them up to dry, so I don't know if they shrink much in the dryer or not.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"CQR Men's Polo Shirt, Short Sleeve Tactical Shirts, Dry Fit Lightweight Performance Golf Shirts, Outdoor UPF 50+ Pique ShirtI'm impressed.I spent about 25ish on each of these shirts (I bought more than one and they had different prices).  I was going to buy the cheap  10-12 dollar polo's, but my biggest beef with buying cheap polo's is that they shrink and/or the collar curls.  First think I did was wash and throw them in the drier.  These shirts are fully synthetic so they held their shape, and weren't wrinkled.The shirts feel comfortable and the weave is different for the various shirts, some seem to be more breathable than others.Fit- Medium seems a bit large - maybe small would be better (bought for medium sized frame)- X-Lrg is about right, maybe just a tiny bit larger (bought for Large to X-lrg sized frame)How long will these shirts last without snagging or developing lint balls?  I don't know, just got them, but the fabric seems to be better quality than other similar type shirts.The label says made in Vietnam.I recommend these polo shirts.  I paid for them and received no compensation for this review.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Nice and comfortable shirt, a comforting place to hang a pen and glasses. The color is a bit faded.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I took a chance on this. I normally just plain colors, but this really caught my eye. Every time I wear it I always get compliments. It's a lighter material than I normally wear, but very comfortable!",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Buen producto, talla correcta",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Love this shirt for its fit and material.. well made!,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Es una camisa de Excelente calidad. A mi gusto es medio calurosa y pesada pero todo lo demas es excelente,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I have purchased several of these in various colors and all have been true to size. Will definitely purchase this brand again,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,An absolute great buy. Will recommend anyone to purchase. Very nice! Love it! Fast shipping,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Es un excelente producto, la tela fresca y muy adecuada para el clima tropical, la talla fue perfecta",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I bought these shirts for work and had a logo stitched in. Have worn for several months and they are holding up well. Very comfortable.Did get a snag in one shirt so 4 stars instead of 5. But no additional ones so far. Fingers crossed?,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,freat,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The sizing is perfect with these, so if you're an American large, order a large. These would run big on Europeans. My first impression is that I love everything about this shirt from the size to the fit to the feel of it. I sent it to the company that does all of our embroidery and had our logos put on it. I ordered matching hats from our embroidery company (Darter Specialties in CT - they ship all over the country - we're in Ohio), and they're a perfect match.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Just what I want and needed,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Good quality, comfortable shirt.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great Shirt.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"This is a perfect shirt, the quality, the fit and the design. I purchased 2. A fellow coworker purchased them and we had our logo put on them. You get a professional look, quality fit for this.  Love the wide range of colors, definitely this drab green.If I could change one aspect would be to make the sleeves maybe 1 in longer, this is more of a preference. I'm 6'3"" with longer arms. Still 5 stars.The pen holders on the arm and at the center of chest are great added features for my line of work.  I look forward to purchasing more.More importantly this shirt gets the women. If I only had this shirt sooner I might still have a wife. She left me and I believe it's because I didn't have this shirt.She is sad now and wants me back but the shirt found me a woman who treats me right. Unfortunately I have to leave the shirt on.  Yes it's that good. The shirt not the Ex.  If anyone in interested in being treated wrong don't purchase this shirt or meet my ex. You will regret both decisions.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"It is important to not up front that i LOVE these shirts.  They fit well, they're comfortable, the colors are good, the pen pockets have been life changing.  I would wear these shirts every did IF I could. Unfortunately, I can't.  I work in a light duty warehouse environment (think cardboard and plastic, not wood and steel) and in less than 6 months all of these shirts are getting pulls and snags from contact with cardboard and other common surfaces.These shirts are too expensive to consider disposable and replace every year.  They would probably be okay for an office or mail room, but not for much heavier use. I am a fan of CQR products and wear the pants to work with no issue.  I will continue to wear these shirts in my leisure time, but have begun investigating more durable options for use at work.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Love the sunglasses loop and the fit and colors are great.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I love CQR my closet is full of their gear! Ty guys!!!,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Not too shiny and fits well.  Not as well as the model in the pictures, but he's built better.  I like the pockets and the loops for your glasses.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Shirt started to fray after I washed it once. Love the shirt and comfortability but seems cheaply made.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"These are excellent shirts for the money.  I have purchased other ""tactical"" polos that cost twice as much and were not as comfortable.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I love the size and colors of these shirts.  However I had to remove a star because the material is a tight knit that has already started pilling and I have multiple areas where little snags have popped out.  I've only worn this shirt 5 or 6 times so I'm not even sure if I'll even get to wear it 20 times before I have to retire it.  Everything else, temperature, value, style, fit, and breathability are great.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Great shipper, great seller",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,These are some of the best shirts I have bought. Super lightweight fit really well. I love that they have a lage in a Tall size and the same with extra large. sleeves and shoulder seams sit at the perfect spot much cooler than other dry fit type shirts. The only issue is with Amazons delivery. I have put specific instructions that have yet to be followed. Dogs got packages and destroyed several times. There needs to be more color options in the xl tall size. I just however cannot say enough good things about these shirts,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Like the color. Fits good. Just hesitant if it will get holes easy since it is a little to thin for what I thought but it is comfortable and would get more will see after a few washes,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,True to size. Comfortable in fall spring weather but may nit be breathable during the humid summer days.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Bought the shirt, but fit was too small.  Had to return.  Make sure to check your actual size and refer to their chart for correct sizing before ordering.  Material was nice, can not say more as I did keep it.",3
B0CL6FGZ9H,i bought it for a present it's very nice,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,This shirt is great if you are looking for a light/form fitting shirt that is light weight and breathable! Quality isn't the greatest but you get what you pay for.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Nothing special, fits nicely and is decent fabric. Also has a stiff collar and as we all know that is all that matters in a polo.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The shirt is soft, breathable, and has an athletic cut to it so its not excessively baggy in the waist. The material is similiar to some exercise shirts, but it doesn't really look like it unless you are very close.  The collars seem solid and hopefully won't curl without needing stays in them.The material could definitely snag, but that is the downside to the breathable material.Also the sizing is way off.  I wear a Mens M in just about everything from stores and a S in this shirt is a solid men's M.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Decent quality shirt but beware it runs smaller than normal so definitely order a size up from what your used to.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The package arrived promptly, and I am satisfied with the quality of the shirt. I particularly like the extra loops for my sunglasses and a pen.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,I needed this shirt for a business outing. I had it embedded with the company logo.  Perfect fit and a great value for the money.  I have since bout 2 more.  Love it,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I'm really impressed with this polo shirt. It feels very sturdy and well-made, like it's built to last for years. The fabric is thick and durable, yet it's also comfortable to wear. I appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction; everything seems solid and well put together. The design is classic and versatile, making it suitable for both casual outings and more formal occasions. It's easy to care for too; I've washed it a few times already and it still looks as good as new. The fit is true to size, which is always a plus when ordering online. Overall, I'm pleased with the quality and durability of this polo shirt. It's a great addition to my wardrobe and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting piece.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I have worn the shirts I purchased and they are excellent quality. Lightweight yet durable. Colors hold up after repeat washings. Great value for the money. Good for work in the field or the office and also can be worn for casual gatherings. 5 stars well earned and will buy from seller again.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I haven't worn this type of shirt in half a century,  and fortunately when I ordered this one it has turned out to be a winner. I have  thoroughly enjoyed this shirt this summer season. The size and color are perfect,  it washed well and comes from the dryer ready to wear.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Good quality and color. Runs large so had to return the 2x for an XL for my husband. Once we got the right size, it was a good fit.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I think these shirts are great like the colors and very comfortable I'm getting more great company,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Seems to be nice material, fits nice, and launders well.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Soft and fits nicely.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,I like these shirts. I was skeptical at first but they are a good quality shirt. I liked it so much I bought a 2nd one.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,This is a moderately heavy shirt that looks good. I'm going to wash mine with Woolite or Oxo-clean for light colors and dry in delicate so it lasts. These are could if you want to wear something a little more formal than a T-shirt. I like them.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,My wife is very impressed. What better feedback do I need?,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Comfortable and durable,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Fits well and excellent workmanship.  Material is worth the time to order.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"They fit well.They look good.And I'm a bigger guy (XXL).I look a little slimmer in them.For the price, I bought 5 of them for work (I need collared shirts for work).They're all different colors, so no-one accuses me of not doing laundry.They're light-weight and breathable, so they are comfortable for the summertime.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Purchased this in the middle of a hot streak... what a awesome shirt.  It fits great and it truly does keep you cool and dry.  It is my favorite golf shirt!!!,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Nice shirts.  I got 5 of them.  Good fit.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,My husband does not like to wear cotton shirts for many reasons.  I found these  and they look great on!  The fit is really nice (even on a little dad-bod belly) and they wash and dry without wrinkling.  Whew!  No maintenance.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Nice shirt but thin and tight and runs small so you better look somewhat like the model. I wanted a polo more like a shirt not T-shirt. I am sending back.,3
B0CL6FGZ9H,I bought this shirt for tactical use but also use it in a casual office environment. Looks good and functions well.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great shirt for the price.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Good quality but size didn't match,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Please please restock in 2x Tall,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Good shirt, pretty basic and not my favorite. I love the brand, but I could take or leave this shirt.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great quality and breathable material !,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Seems to be decent quality but definitely a cherry red vs brick or darker red pictured,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Between myself and my son, we own like 5 of these shirts. Lightweight dry-fit type material, but in a thicker weave, so perfect for the office. So far they are also washing up very nicely and haven't snagged or pilled yet.Will definitely get more when more colors are available. XL-tall fit perfectly.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I have ordered many different brands and the essential and basic in this brand and keep going back to this pro polo. Please get more pro polos in sizes other than small.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I'm 6'2,210lbs ,athletic build and the large tall fits perfect. I always have a problem finding shirts.  Large fits well but is usually too short.  XL is  long enough but too big and boxy.  I'm glad I came across this brand and the tall sizes.  I bought 5 of these for work to replace a different brand that has lasted a couple years now.  The material on these shirts is a little thinner but feels much better and they stretch which is nice for comfort.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Was looking for a work shirt and this has some comfortable cloth. Totally stoked i got it during sale! Its totally worth it though as it is as dry fit as they state it is. Love the color and the cuts on the side.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Fit good, nice true color",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Just received it today, but I like how it looks on me and so far it seems like a great Polo shirt.  Now just have to keep an eye on durability.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,The color and fit are great! Has not shrunk and is holding up well. Keeps my viking size hubby dry while looking professional for work. Going to order more in other colors.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Yeah, I know, hard to believe.  I have PRPS jeans, prada shoes and collector Nike's.  I've been an unwitting expensive clothing hoarder forever.  I have tried everything they offer.  The camo flanel / fleece shirts are my favorite.  These crews are perfectly balanced between sheen, weight and shape.  The drape perfectly (5'10"", 190, size L).And the sizes are true to shape.  I got some polo shirts, both long and short sleeve, with and without the little pen pockets and other thoughtful little places to put things and I find myself wearing them more than anything else.  Great brands, I bet any of the products  you try by them you'll like.  Olive green and charcoal are amazing colors in any style shirt they have!",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I ordered this shirt for my husband for a family reunion. It was a great fit and the color was great on him. I will be ordering another in a different color.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I like the shirt a lot it fits nice based on your recommendation to pick out a large. I would definitely buy again and I want to thank you for having it available.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Bought this shirt to have embroidered for my admin shirt. I wear the cqr tactical shirt most days for work and it fits amazing but this polo is definitely not made with the same sizing guidelines. Fits in width but seems to be short.Shirt is very lightweight, soft material, wish it was true to size.",2
B0CL6FGZ9H,"This was perfect. Sizing was great and material is very breathable. Great for law enforcement/security staff, as well as your every day civilian.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great,5
B018DQI4XM,"These are very good thermals. They definitely help maintain body warmth. The material is soft, stretches well, and is very comfortable to wear alone or under outer clothing. A very well made thermal that I am glad to have purchased.",5
B018DQI4XM,The material is excellent and wears and washes very well. Both my husband and I wore ours on a whale watching excursion in winter and were extremely warm and comfortable. We like them so well we bought a second set for each of us. I would highly recommend!,5
B018DQI4XM,"Fit perfect, comfortable and kept me warm but not too warm.  Very Pleased.  I'm 5'11"", 183lbs and a 33"" waist and I purchased the medium.",5
B018DQI4XM,"Comfortable and warm material, so, mission accomplished.  For a 2x size, they could be a little bit longer in leg, and maybe a touch roomier.  They are form fitting, not loose at all",4
B018DQI4XM,"They were the perfect size and are keeping me warm in this NY winter! Not only are they comfortable to walk long distances in during my commute to work, but they are also very comfortable to work 8 hour shifts in!",5
B018DQI4XM,"I received these a day before I received an assignment in a really cold climate. While my skin felt cool, it was not cold, and I was able to perform physical tasks without sweating being bundled up.A great price, really comfortable.",5
B018DQI4XM,"Bought based on a recommendation from a friend. The material is supremely comfortable.... like wearing a second skin suit made of silk. Warmth so far is good, but I'm only wearing them in a chilly house. No idea how they would perform in outdoors cold (I bought them for lounging). Sizing is spot on and there is enough elasticity that they don't feel restrictive. However.... the pilling. Dear god the pilling. I washed them on gentle cycle, alone, immediately after receiving. Dried on ultra low. No noticeable pilling out of the drier, but after wearing for about 3 hours (nothing worn over them) they are covered in pill balls. I don't really understand why because normally I see pilling on high abrasion areas of clothes. These do it all on their own. For the price these are pretty excellent, but I don't expect them to hold up to long-term lounging.",4
B018DQI4XM,"I am a very cold person and can never see to warm up. I bought a set of Reebok thermals that were very thin and basically did nothing and I thought this must be what all of them are like. Until I saw these and decided to order them and give them a try. They are SO warm and comfortable, I wear them every day when I go to work and I am going to order a couple more pairs in some different colors. I absolutely recommend these to anyone looking for a little extra warmth without sacrificing comfort.",5
B018DQI4XM,"I'm not a big guy. I wear a 30"" waist jean. And although the size chart indicates a Small (30""waist) will fit me, I ordered a Medium (32"" waist) and I'm glad I did. On me, the medium is a perfect, snug fit. These are light thermals with a bit of stretch. I wouldn't call the ""lining,"" which is just the back side of the fabric, a fleece. It is something else soft, with a light thermal property. Outside surface is slick, which I appreciate, for not sticking to the pants laying over. These base layer thermals do what they say and would make great jammies for someone who sleeps cold.",4
B018DQI4XM,My husband is a road driver and is in and out of this frigid cold. Bought these for him to wear underneath his warm outdoor cloths and he said they were great! He was very comfortable when working outside. Highly recommend. Bought a womens set for my daughter. She works for the post office and is also outside in this frigid weather. Wear great and wash great.,5
B018DQI4XM,"This is one of those times where not reading the description carefully enough worked out in my favor. I was originally just looking for some basic long johns. I thought these were those old school long johns that many of us grew up with. It turns out they are actually more like Under Armour Cold Gear. The inside is super soft, actually softer than the Under Armour Cold Gear base layer I own. If they hold up after washing a few times I'll likely be buying several more sets as I walk about 3 miles a day minimum in all weather conditions. They were incredibly warm today during my first walk in them. I'm entirely impressed.",5
B018DQI4XM,"I bought these to help me make it through these cold mornings while I'm working outside. I like that there were color options. They fit pretty snugly. I purchased th 3X because I'm a larger guy. If you don't like tightly fitting clothing,  you may want to buy the next size up.  These definitely help keep me warmer. They are a little different than the thermals that I grew up with but they work. I would purchase these again.",5
B018DQI4XM,Really soft and warm and has a nice tight yet relaxed fit.  Glad I ordered a little large as the softness inside the shirt kind of sticks to my t-shirts but with the larger size it helps to get it over my t-shirts more easily.  Great fit to the pants.  Really worked well with temps in the 20s.  Would love to get a set for my gf.,5
B018DQI4XM,"I jad to fly into Dallas, Texas where the temperature was in the high 30's.  I wore this thermal under my jeans and shirt.  It is very lightweight.  The only thing that was cold was my ears and nose as they were out in the weather.  This was a great buy.  I definitely would recommend this product!",5
B018DQI4XM,"Purchased these for my son.  He has to work outside and it was recently in the teens, so we purchased these.  He liked them so much we ordered another pair.  He said they are very comfortable and kept him very warm.  He was very pleased with them.",5
B018DQI4XM,I bought 2 of these sets for my son and he loves them.  The sizing was as described in the description and they fit perfectly.Definitely worth the buy,5
B018DQI4XM,"I bought these for winter biking. I'm a bit chunk-er than I should be.  I ordered a 3X based on the size chart. Most of my shirts are either 2X.  I figured the 3X would be closer to my size.  The website does give some general sizes which were helpful but I think tend to show what they want, but the product fits smaller. The pants fit OK. A little bit tight, but I think you want long johns to be on the tighter side. The top doesn't fit at all. I know now how sausage feels like when it shoved into its casing. For me the top is unwearable cause it's just too tight. I'm not gonna bother replacing the top. I'll just see if I could find a bigger top. Or- I could try to lose some weight, there's always thatBut I've been using the bottoms to go bike riding in the colder weather and they are fine. They keep me really warm. Even down to 38 or so.  I have no complaints on how they perform. But wonder if a bigger size would have been better?",4
B018DQI4XM,This was my second order of these and still amazed how warm they keep you considering how thin and unrestrictive they are. Wore the top under a golf shirt today and had to take it off after 2 holes because it was too hot.,5
B018DQI4XM,My boyfriend loved these thermals. We have extremely cold weather and it keeps you warm. The fit is perfect too. Not too tight like some thermals that fit like tights.,5
B018DQI4XM,I got these because the temperature dropped dramatically and I needed them for work outside. They are very warm and I stayed very comfortable. These were a great buy.,5
B018DQI4XM,"Absolutely love these thermals. The positive reviews are accurate. Thet are soft, thin and do a great job keeping in the warmth. I will definitely purchase more for colder weather activities.",5
B018DQI4XM,Keeps me extremely warm in below freezing temps. Allows me to layer and stay not as bulky as a large coat. I need 2 more pair because I don't take them off long enough to wash!Only down side and this may be all under garments is i wore it under a new sweatshirt and afterwards it collected little fabric balls on it. But I love it,5
B018DQI4XM,I bought them for my husband. He said that they were comfortable and warm. He liked them so much. He ask me to order him a second pair.,5
B018DQI4XM,"I bought 2x as that is what I wear.  Package says 2x is 38"" waist, I wish as this 2x guy is closer to 44.  You may want to go up a size if 2x is your number.",4
B018DQI4XM,"Soft and comfy. I looked at their size chart and ordered what corresponds to my measurements.  I ordered a 4xl, I normally wear a 2xl. Definitely fits and wears like the old Under Armour compression fit garments.  Not a bad thing but good to know in advance. I figured if the chart was wrong these would fit over a couple of other layers. These are gonna be the base layer or worn alone. They were sort of slow to dry after washing in sport wash. I only hang up these types of garments, never place in a dryer no matter the setting.",4
B018DQI4XM,"I'm happy:mostly use for low 40's temps and very warm so 30's should be good. The fit: I'm 5' 8"" 32/30 pants 40R jacketthe large fits me perfect. no weird off gassing smell when opened and soft against the skin.",5
B018DQI4XM,"This is my second review- the first was because they ""said"" they were not going to arrive in time- but they did in fact arrive. They feel amazing.  So soft and smooth. Very very satisfied.",5
B018DQI4XM,I absolutely love these! I wear them all the time in bed and around the house. They are so soft to touch. This is a must to have!,5
B018DQI4XM,This product fits perfect and the fleece lining is definitely very warm. Will be putting it to use in 10 days when I make my way to Iceland!,5
B018DQI4XM,The waistline stitching came loose and fell apart after 2nd time wearing leggings.  I contacted Thermajohn customer support directly and they promptly responded and sent a replacement pair.,4
B018DQI4XM,"We have had a deep freeze here in New England.  My husband needed  extra heat, this did the trick. Great item light weight too.",5
B018DQI4XM,Size chart was correct.  Pant at 27 inches actually stretched to fit my 34 inch length.Nice and warm at 10 degrees f.,5
B018DQI4XM,I ordered these to wear when riding my motorcycle in cooler temperatures. They fit well and are not bulky at all. They help keep me warm. They do what they are supposed to do.,5
B018DQI4XM,"I sent it to a friend, and he says it is fine. It keeps his legs, in particular, warm. He hs not yet tried to wash it.",5
B018DQI4XM,My husband LOVES these - soft and comfy; good fit but not tight. He has 2 pairs now. Highly recommend.  Seems true to size.,5
B018DQI4XM,I work in construction and my Thermajohns are probably the most comfortable long johns I have purchased so far. No bunching up issues when climbing. Shirts could be just a little longer for tucking in but very comfortable for all day wearing.,5
B018DQI4XM,Absolutely love the feel of the fabric. I work outside in Chiago all yr long. During winter these were absolutely fabulous underneath my clothes. THE BEST!,5
B018DQI4XM,"Slightly pricey in my opinion but these are good as long johns get, very stretchy but warm and also not flimsy or overly-thin.  Good, strong material.  Added bonus, the ankles on the pants are VERY snug, preventing them from slide-crawling up your calf when you put pants on.  I had to order another pair.",5
B018DQI4XM,Bought these for my teen son for a hunting trip to KS. They fit as expected for an average 15 yr old boy. Color is as shown. They are soft yet thick enough to stay warm. Great value for the money.,5
B018DQI4XM,They seem ok. They seem to roll a bit at the waist and creep up on stomach.,4
B018DQI4XM,Sizing is iffy.  Having to order larger than normal but now that I know that it's fine.  Donated the first pair.,5
B018DQI4XM,I normally wear XL but I sized up to 2XL and they fit perfectly. Keels your warm with out restricting movement. No bunching or overheating either. Good product all around.,5
B018DQI4XM,"thicker than my old thermals, this was great quality and kept me plenty warm on the mountain where it was below freezing!",5
B018DQI4XM,"They are lined with either a brushed cotton or a very fine fleece which allows for a soft feel against your skin and provided a wicking effect to draw moisture off your body adding to the warmth.This is my third set of these, as my sons have enjoyed the comfort and feel as well.",5
B018DQI4XM,I have always bought the store ones but I order this and I was amazed on how it keeps me warm,5
B018DQI4XM,It was a gift for my son. He said the fit is perfect and they are soft and warm. He likes them a lot.,5
B018DQI4XM,I bought these to use in Maine but have had to use them in Texas recently.  They're comfortable and they work...,5
B018DQI4XM,My husband says these winter underwear are comfortable and warm. They are not thick and bulky so cannot be detected under your clothes,5
B018DQI4XM,"SC has been cold so I needed something for my morning walks before work, after over 2 decades of selling winter clothing at big box i ordered these as a base layer and so happy with the outcome. Great feel and perfect fit but I did size down and I am about a 36"" waste and 210# and I did large w a perfect thermal fit w/o feeling like I am in Spanx",5
B018DQI4XM,We bought two sets . The size n material was better than we expected them to be. They feel good on ur skin,5
B018DQI4XM,"THEY FIT!!!!!! I Ordered another pair cause, they do keep you warm as well. I've had 20F degree weather here lately and while I still wear an overcoat with slacks they work well, meaning, in slacks my legs stay warm. recommend some good socks and gloves but i'm so glad that Amazon and this Seller allowed this product to be available, yes I am sucking up, this is a great ..how do i phrase that? umm, this item should be a best seller.",5
B018DQI4XM,Wore them in a 10in snow storm on the gulf coast. Very warm. Very comfortable. Will probably buy another set or two.,5
B018DQI4XM,So far so good ! Fit was true to size .  Used on a winter camping/ski trip and these thermals kept my son warm all weekend. He said the material was soft and comfy . As this item was just purchased I will update if they wear down quickly or laundering is an issue.,5
B018DQI4XM,"I bought it to my son. I washed in the washing machine and put it in the dryer. Came out perfect. My son loves it. He wears it as an under layer all the time when leaving the house, and finds it very warming and comfortable. He asked me to buy him another set, so he liked it for sure",5
B018DQI4XM,"Good 2nd layer, keeps me warmer in a Georgia winter. I'd normally wear a large, went two sizes up to 2XL and it fits great. Going to buy another set, different color. I got black. I'm a muscular 5'10 and 185.",5
B018DQI4XM,"These are nice long johns.  I was suprised to see how silky the outside of them felt, kind of like nighty type silky. Husband thought I bought these for me cause of how silky the outside of them are but he still wears them and works outdoors.  Guess they do their job cause he hasn't complained.",5
B018DQI4XM,"Jumped into the Thermajohn pant/shirt for an evening walk in cold 45-50 degree weather and was absolutely warm, dry and comfortable as promised!  Soft to the skin and cozy. I would recommend purchasing a size up if you prefer a not to tight fit. Love em!",5
B018DQI4XM,"I'm 5 10 and maybe 140lbs. Sleeve and pants length are 3 to 4 inches shorter than they should be, in my opinion. So definitely up size or try before you buy.",4
B018DQI4XM,the feel and the warmth were great but I had a problem with the bottoms not coming up far enough to my waist in the rear and I am a slender person. they keep sliding down after wearing awile.,4
B018DQI4XM,"They're comfortable as a base layer, but not as warm as traditional thermal under wear.",4
B018DQI4XM,These are great thermal underwear the only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that I feel that the top portion is a bit undersized.Very comfortable and non-irritating on the skin.Would buy again.,4
B018DQI4XM,"Very smooth and comfortable.  Not as warm as some other brands, but fair value.",4
B018DQI4XM,They are warm and comfortable without being bulky.  Just what I was looking for.  I would definitely order again.,5
B018DQI4XM,This is my best black friday purchase for the winter.1. The fabric is super comfy. Even as a standalone sleepware it feels great to the skin.2. I chose white as I could wear it with my white shirts.3. I went to DC and NYC to see Christmas decorations/lights during -6 C with this thermal and a dress shirt and a casual windbreaker. It was more than enough.4. Did machine wash with tap cold water and air dried. So far looks good.,5
B018DQI4XM,They fit well under my cloths. Tremendous warmth in zero degree weather. Great value. I purchased more after trying one pair.,5
B018DQI4XM,"Medium warmth, fair priced; but runs small. Get a size up if you buy.",4
B018DQI4XM,"The undergarment was comfortable, form fitting  and was warm enough to go through a Groundhog Day event in Pennsylvania at 3am in the morning at 12 degrees freezing temperature.",5
B018DQI4XM,Size chart is a great help. Tops and bottom fit perfect and the cold snap we just had i used them with no worries.  Keeps me warm and the fabric stayed around the ankle and neck waist etc as it should.  I bought more.,5
B018DQI4XM,"my husband loves them, they fit well, keep him warm under regular pants. He is much warmer while Shoveling snow.",5
B018DQI4XM,"These were great while I spent Christmas in Europe. But after arriving and washing them, there is already a built up of motes :(",4
B018DQI4XM,Bought these because we have an arctic blast coming in and i work in a machine shop and my shipping guy and painter leave the garage door wide open all day. I'll update next week after it hits.,5
B018DQI4XM,"5'10"" 220 and the Xlarge fit good.  Snug just perfect.  Only thing that would make this set complete would be socks and gloves.",4
B018DQI4XM,So comfortable you forget you have them on until everyone around you is shaking and your not.  Great for motorcycles.,5
B018DQI4XM,The style and fit of these are much better than the old style these do not make you itch and they are very warm . I work in a cold warehouse and they keep me nice and warm .,5
B018DQI4XM,"They are soft and warm and do the job and my major complaint is that they started to pill up, esp. the bottoms after only a few washes. Fortunately, for everyone, my wife and I are the only ones who can see it.",4
B018DQI4XM,This is really a good pair of long johns not like your grandpa's but like the new age. They fit snug and tight and keep you warm when temperatures are really cold. They do run small so make sure you buy a bigger size.,5
B018DQI4XM,"These are the best thermal underwear i have ever worn, I originally purchased them for hunting season and have worn them in very frigid temperatures with great results.  i highly recommend and i am considering purchasing another.",5

B010RWDJOY,Nice socks.  Held up well in wash,4
B010RWDJOY,I wanted the nike socks with cushion and say dry fit on the toes.  These were not the right ones.  Alsonthey are of lesser quality.  I donated them,3

B010RWDJOY,I love the socks.,4
B010RWDJOY,"I used to buy my 16 year old son cheaper socks but have been investing a little bit more by getting these as he was going through cheaper brands like candy.  He plays basketball, track, works out and practices basketball barefoot out front on the concrete a lot. He is hard on socks!!  These definitely hold up to all he puts them though.  I have tried other Nike brand styles as well. He prefers these and so do I because I only have to re-purchase about every 2 years as opposed to at most every year on others.  You cannot beat the quality for the price on these.  It was also cheaper to buy on amazon than through the Nike app even with promo codes.",5
B010RWDJOY,These socks are my great nephew's favorite. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.,5
B010RWDJOY,Been using nike socks for years. They always look and feel great,5

B010RWDJOY,"These are the only socks my teenage son will wear.  We have tried to get him other less expensive brands, but he won't do it.  I guess I am okay with that because they do seem to be very durable and survive a rigorous daily lacrosse practice.  They keep their shape well and he says they are the most comfortable.",5
B010RWDJOY,Fast shipping,5
B010RWDJOY,Boys are tough on socks and these are perfect!,5

B010RWDJOY,"good socks for all occasions, stains are hard to get out",4
B010RWDJOY,Fit well,5
B010RWDJOY,"These are nice socks, but I struggle with the order as one of my sons only likes the 3/4 length socks.  Sometimes I've ordered and they are good and others they are longer.  I don't think it's clear what length you are getting and, even if it was, I don't think it's consistent.  Last time I ordered I found another seller on here and they were good - but I will have to see if that is the same if I order again.",3
B010RWDJOY,"My grandson, 15, had these socks on his birthday wish list.  He was so happy when he opened them.",5
B010RWDJOY,Fit is good-,5
B010RWDJOY,"What's not to love about these socks? They fit very well, stay up on the calf all day and best of all, they are super durable. My kids beat up socks badly... they have the awful habit of running around in their socks, often outside. Also, they don't always cut their toenails right away and those eagle talons are like razors to socks. Most socks don't survive a month with those two. However, we've had these now for several months and, even though they've done their time outside without shoes, I haven't seen a hole. I'd totally buy these again.",5
B010RWDJOY,"Sock length doesnt look like in the pic, they are way too long, the almost go up to the bottom of my knees. I would suggest ordering 1 size down.",3
B010RWDJOY,came in perfect condition and felt so nice on my feet,5
B010RWDJOY,there really comfy and the quality is great,5
B010RWDJOY,"Nice quality & true to size. But, I don't do white socks for a reason. NEVER white on the bottom ever again, no matter what. My son had to have these. The tops are nice & white & although it says no bleach, I've bleached & scrubbed the bottoms of these socks, still darker. & yes, our floors are quite clean!:)",5
B010RWDJOY,My husband wanted to try the Nike socks that were longer. He loves them! Definitely recommend for teens as well!,5

B010RWDJOY,This is the only socks my teen wears,5
B010RWDJOY,"CAN'T BEAT NIKE SOCKS, LOOK AND FEEL WONDERFUL.",5
B010RWDJOY,"It is good quality, a little too thick, but this is what is trending among teens now. They are comfortable and look good.",5
B010RWDJOY,"These socks are just ok, I can get better quality socks at Costco and at a lower price.",3
B010RWDJOY,"Great socks, quality is good overall the socks are good for the price",4
B010RWDJOY,These socks are the best socks I have ever gotten definitely will be worth my money great purchase!! They are super comfortable not too tight and not to loose just the right size,5
B010RWDJOY,"These socks were a gift to my granddaughter and she ""loved"" them!",4
B010RWDJOY,My husband wanted these crew socks as he has been preferring to wear a little higher sock. He likes that they are not too constricting around his ankles.,5
B010RWDJOY,"I received these in the shipping bag, inside they were wrapped in 2 separate bags. Upon opening they were filthy. I tried to wash them, they would not come clean. After washing them I noticed they were dirty on the bottom of the socks, these socks have been worn, and sold to me as new. The pic is after they were washed. Notice one pair has one dri-fit sock and one regular sock. These are going in the garbage, along with my 30 bucks...",1

B010RWDJOY,My grandson loved them.,5
B010RWDJOY,Took out a new pair and wore for 10 hours. Lots of lints all inside of my shoes. Not sure I can wear them next time due to the lints. Other than that comfortable socks.,2
B010RWDJOY,"Ordered for my son. They're thinner than his other athletic socks.  So far, they've held up, but I don't think they'll last as long as a thicker sock.",3
B010RWDJOY,The socks are nice enough.  The problem is that the sizing description says they are men's and women's sizes and I definitely received kid's socks.  Sad for us.,3
B010RWDJOY,I purchased these socks for my daughter for Christmas. I paid $32.00 for them. When they arrived the SRP on the package said $24.00. I feel like I got hosed. You can be sure I will shop around next time.,3

B008YA0Z44,"I don't know what adidas does with their socks, but this is quite possibly the most comfortable pair of socks I've ever had. They feel soft yet snug, and breathe really well indicating a high quality cotton thread. I'm especially impressed that it comes in an X-Large size, which is often hard for me to find.Most of my socks start to fall apart quickly, but these are holding up well. I've read other reviews that they tend to fall apart after a year, so we'll have to see if that's the case for me. But so far so good. And I like them so much that I decided to buy another 6 pack.",5
B008YA0Z44,"I got two sets of these socks and loved them.  I've had trouble finding socks I like so I got 2 more sets for Christmas.  After running them through the wash and assuming they were all the same size, I go put on a pair and one sock goes up 6"" from my knee and the other one is probably 9-12"" from the knee.  I could feel the material was significantly different.  Pairing them after washing is now a major pain because the size difference isn't really obvious without close inspection.  Hopefully it will become more obvious after a few washings.Don't get me wrong, I still like all the socks, they're all high quality, but they are very inconsistent.",4
B008YA0Z44,"material very comfy, thickened at the toe area hopefully it won't get holes; sock not too long nor too short - ideal length; i go to gym very often so i need a sock to absorb sweat and stay dry, will see how it goes.",5
B008YA0Z44,"So friggin comfy, especially with no toe stitching anywhere to rub against your feet. And the ankle tightness is spot on",5
B008YA0Z44,"Fast shipping, the regular adidas socks were out of stock but these are the exact same.",5
B008YA0Z44,"Bought these for my teenage sons and they are amazing!!! They love how they look with shorts or pants. True to size. Definitely worth the money, even though they're not badly priced.",5
B008YA0Z44,"Product arrived just as advertised, good quality Adidas socks, definitely recommend to others",5
B008YA0Z44,"My husband needed new socks & I kept forgetting to get some so I ordered these for same day delivery. As soon as he put on a pair, he told me he loved them. He loves the cushioning.",5

B008YA0Z44,Arrived on time. Good quality.,5
B008YA0Z44,"For years my ""go-to"" sock has been the Dockers crew sock with the orange stripe on top.  Haven't been able to get them lately so I went looking for an alternative.  I like these.  They're not quite as heavy as the Dockers, but still offer enough padding that they're not thin like dress socks.",5
B008YA0Z44,"se nota que son medias duraderas, muy comodas, lo valen.",5
B008YA0Z44,Seem durable and fit nicely. Happy with them,5

B008YA0Z44,"Socks look and feel good.  I've ordered twice, second order was over calf length which makes it a real pain to match in the wash.  Packaging is way overdone.",4

B008YA0Z44,Very soft and cushioned. They are thick but stretchy. Go up mid shin but are warm.,5
B008YA0Z44,Was a gift for someone who wanted socks.  He is enjoying them.,5
B008YA0Z44,This package of socks met all his requirements. Well fitting. Very cushioned. Right height and color. I am very happy that he loved this brand of socks the best.,5

B008YA0Z44,Buenas calidad de medias!!,5
B008YA0Z44,Feel good and fit well. Would buy again.,5
B008YA0Z44,"The quality is first-class in every way. The only ding is they come up about 1-1/2"" too high on the leg. No biggie, but you gotta be perfect to get 5 stars.",4
B008YA0Z44,"Fit well, keep their shape and stay up",5
B008YA0Z44,They were a little too stiff for me,4
B008YA0Z44,comfy bought again and the olds still have life.,5

B008YA0Z44,"Nice thick material, very comfortable for everyday wear.",5
B008YA0Z44,Soft yet medium weight. Would buy again.,5
B008YA0Z44,"This may sound strange, but I'm a men's 9.5 shoe and I ordered the XL socks (size 12-15.) They look really big BUT they actually fit great. They don't slide or bunch on my feet, and neither do they compress too much. I like socks that stay in place but are not tight. It's a fine balance: my only issue with these is that the calves are a bit too tight. After a day at work there are compression lines on my calves, even though I don't pull up the socks all the way. They are soft and comfy. Good for fall weather or work in an air-conditioned space. I've only had them for a week but I'm happy with them.",4
B008YA0Z44,Ok,5
B008YA0Z44,Item arrived as described,5
B008YA0Z44,Some people say there a bit tight especially after washing. And they kind of are. All you have to do is stretch them out a bit from side to side and your set. The quality of the sock is really good. I have had no issues and there super comfortable.,5
B008YA0Z44,I bought them a year ago and they are still like new. No broken yet.,5
B008YA0Z44,Very comfortable socks that are well cushioned but still breathable for a premium feel.,5
B008YA0Z44,Now I look like all the cool kids. Woot woot!,5
B008YA0Z44,These socks are great.  My boyfriend loves the colors too. 11 size shoes and they fit nicely and soft.,5
B008YA0Z44,Its a good material but not too comfortable(super tight). I have skinny legs btw.,4
B008YA0Z44,Bulk purchases are great and should last a couple of years. Functions as described and keeps my feet warm.,5
B008YA0Z44,"A little right,but high quality",4
B008YA0Z44,Good,5
B008YA0Z44,"Bought them for my 86 year old uncle to go w expensive walking shoes. Perfect fit, great quality & stretch is good.",5
B008YA0Z44,Very comfy,5
B008YA0Z44,Had to buy these 4 a basketball game and they came in like a day and fit great. Not slippery. True to size,5
B008YA0Z44,My son loves these!,5
B00W66LQFO,"Bought these for the gym and they are lightweight, durable, comfortable, true size fitting and just amazing for the price. Would also be PERFECT for screen printing and the fact that they are tagless is a huge plus!",5
B00W66LQFO,I've bought now 4 different sets of these shirts for my husband and myself. The white shirts I used for radiation treatment and it is true the darker colors do shrink or are a little smaller. So depending on the fit you want size up on darker colors if you want a looser fit. I bought both M and L and wear M more with things that can be seen more on the outside. So the L is more like a looser undershirt. The white t is good and loose for sleeping. Especially when I didn't want anything clinging to me.Only one flaw out of 4 different sets. I just fixed it on my serger.The shirts can be worn as under shirts or as shirts. All are a good medium weight quality and are soft. Better than a lot of the junk I find in retail stores now so happy with the quality. They last a long time and still look good.All are pretty wrinkle resistant and easy to clean.,5
B00W66LQFO,So far so good. Seem to be good quality and fit. The color was as listed on pic and is a good value.,4
B00W66LQFO,Got husband big and tall (extra long) 3xl.  I was tired of seeing him in mid-drift tshirts so I took a chance on these.  We both really like them for the fit and the length.  We are in Florida and he wanted lighter weight and softer tshirts for sleeping.  If I can find these in colors I will get those as well.  Will order more of the white also. Happy with purchase at a good price.,5
B00W66LQFO,"They run a little small, but these are great shirts. They feel great and they are tagless. It's nice to have color combinations as well.",5
B00W66LQFO,"Fits great, long enough to stay tucked in, very comfortable, affordable. I wear these under scrubs and they work great.",5
B00W66LQFO,"White t-shirts are a timeless wardrobe staple, versatile enough to be dressed up or down for nearly any occasion. The simplicity of a white tee makes it the perfect base layer for layering or a stand-alone piece that can make a statement on its own.",5
B00W66LQFO,Those moisture wicking shirts are great in warm seasons but they generate a lot of static in the cold seasons. I got sick of zapzap! So decided to go back to 100% cotton in winter.These are very comfortable and soft to wear. I might stick with these even in the warm seasons!,5
B00W66LQFO,"These shirts are weird in how they're sized.  A 2xl is massive and the xl is super tight.  I typically wear a 2xl, but these are very large.  They are comfortable and the color is seeming to last a while.",4
B00W66LQFO,"I bought these for myself, an old lady, because I wanted longer shirt length.  I'm very well pleased as they come to mid-thigh.The fabric is a delight against the skin!  So soft!",5
B00W66LQFO,"The delivery bag was broken open at the end, but the plastic that housed the product t-shirts held up well. Fruit of the Loom t-shirts are of good quality.  The only problem I had was during the product when the corner of the bag was opened.",4
B00W66LQFO,"Too often we short and chubby folks gt shirts that are too short, or shrink in the wash to become short and tight.  I have been using these daily, washing them for several months and have found no shrinkage or shortening to mention.",5
B00W66LQFO,When I travel for work I always wear one of these shirts. They are decently priced as well. They keep me cool while flying on a plane.,5
B00W66LQFO,its a great price for pack of shirts and white color and material is perfect,5
B00W66LQFO,"And once again, fruit Loom is top quality when it comes to undergarments soft comfortable and durable",5
B00W66LQFO,"Excellent price for the quality. Very soft as stated in the description. Bought size XL for brother who is 5' 9"" and weighs190lbs. Will be buying again.",5
B00W66LQFO,Ordered these to replace some old worn out T's. These are soft and comfortable. Hoping they will last a while.,5
B00W66LQFO,Love the material and fitment of these would buy again,5
B00W66LQFO,"These shirts are very reasonably priced for 6 shirts! They come in a variety of colors, so there's one that matches almost anything I could ever wear. No matter whether I'm wearing them alone or under a nicer shirt, they're super comfortable and they've held up well in the wash so far. I can definitely recommend this product!",5
B00W66LQFO,"These are all pretty soft, don't cost much, and last forever. Plus, the stuff at the store is all cheap crap, practically plastic pretending to be a decent shirt.",5
B00W66LQFO,Good fit and good price. will buy again when needed,5
B00W66LQFO,"Nice shirts, hold up good after several washes.  My husband likes them very much.  Good value.",5
B00W66LQFO,They shrink.  Make sure to buy a size larger,4
B00W66LQFO,really soft just like the picture,5
B00W66LQFO,"Buena tela ,muy buenos",5
B00W66LQFO,Great quality and value,5
B00W66LQFO,I am very reliably a large for all T-Shirts.  These fix snug more like a base layer t-short and less like a t-shirt.  They are very soft and comfortable otherwise though.,4
B00W66LQFO,These shorts came a day early and were super vibrant ... I'm pleased,5
B00W66LQFO,Fue un buen regalo para mi esposo y se sienten bien comoda,5
B00W66LQFO,"These Fruit of the Loom tshirts Don't look cheap at all. They're lightweight, soft and comfortable.",5
B00W66LQFO,They were great gifts for the boys and men,5
B00W66LQFO,true fit,5
B00W66LQFO,"Comfortable. Fit is a little tight, so you might order a size up. Normal size makes for a great undershirt.",5
B00W66LQFO,"Colors are good, cotton made, well-fit - overall comfortable to wear.",5
B00W66LQFO,"This is a good value for these. They last a while before the neck/sleeves begin to curl up. By the time they start, I just pitch them and get new ones. They are cheap enough to rotate through to get new ones when needed.",4
B00W66LQFO,Love the colors and how soft they are! Actually sized right!,5
B00W66LQFO,he loves them.  perfect size/quality.,5
B00W66LQFO,The large is more like medium size.,4
B00W66LQFO,Perfect size.,5
B00W66LQFO,Like the tee shirts but surprised it wasn't packaged on a Fruit of the Loom bag.Had no packaging at all. What's up with this Amazon?,4
B00W66LQFO,These shirts are a bit on the thin side but great for use as undershirts. Good neckline and soft.,4
B00W66LQFO,...but why oh why didn't I remember to order ones with pockets? Careful!,4
B00W66LQFO,Buen material,5
B00W66LQFO,"Recomiendo por su comodidad, variedad de colores y el precio, realmente buena la calidad.",5
B00W66LQFO,I am active and usually get stains in my T-shirts so I purchased these so I would have unstained T-shirts and they fit perfect and look great and feel good will buy again,5
B00W66LQFO,Wonderful comfort with soft fabric,5
B00W66LQFO,"Good price for a good variety of solid coloured, well sewn Tshirts. They haven't faded despite many hotwater launderings",5
B00W66LQFO,Fit well and good deal.,5
B00W66LQFO,I ordered these to use as under shirts and they work perfectly.,5
B00W66LQFO,Fit little snug but it works.,4
B00W66LQFO,Not long enough.,4
B00W66LQFO,These are the only tshirts my husband will wear. They are soft and wash well.,5

B00W66LQFO,Good value. I especially like the extended short. It stays tucked in better.,5
B00W66LQFO,"If you like your T-shirts to be bigger on you, I would suggest buying a size larger. They shrink some.",4
B00W66LQFO,Long enough for him to left his arms!,4
B00W66LQFO,PerfectosLa talla perfecta,5
B00W66LQFO,"I know these are for men, but im a woman and bought a size small pack. I quite literally wear these nearly every day. They are well fitting on me, they're easy to style, and are made from thin, breathable cotton. My only issue is that after several washes the material seems to thin out more, however, that may be my fault considering i wear them quite often. Would recommend.",4
B00W66LQFO,"Good shirt but shrunk immediately. Amazon suggested a medium, I'm NO medium so I ordered a large and now they feel medium. Go a size or two up.",4
B00W66LQFO,They're jus a tad bit bigger than I expected however with a short jeans I still rock them. 8/10 satisfaction.,4
B00W66LQFO,I have worn these shirts as undershirts for years.  Good quality and hold up well.  Disappointed that I didn't notice the wrong size was shipped until after I washed them.  Will be sure to inspect next time before opening.,4
B00W66LQFO,"I bought the 6 pack with the 2 black shirts, 1 dark blue, 1 light blue, 1 red, and 1 grey. I made sure it wasn't the heather shirts because I was looking for only 100% cotton shirts, but when I checked the shirts I saw that the grey one is 10% polyester. The rest are as expected, but I'm disappointed because the material matters for my child's skin. They seem soft and decently made. I wanted to leave the review in case anyone else was buying specificly for cotton shirts.",4
B00W66LQFO,As advertised. Great product!,5
B00W66LQFO,They were given as a gift,4
B00W66LQFO,Cotton made it breathable soft material thick enough variety of colors overall good product good quality for its price,4

B00Y0NGBSS,Great quality socks. Comfortable to wear. Wash well. Bleach to get stains out.  Fit well,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I bought these ""Hanes Men's Double Tough Crew Socks"" for my husband. For me, the Hanes brand has always indicated a good, quality product - and this purchase was just that. Also, the price was in my budget since my husband and I are both retired.The description provided was exact. The socks have held up well after many wears and washings. My husband enjoys wearing these socks. I recommend this product.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I am one who when I find something I like I stay with it. I have been buying these Hanes mens socks on Amazon and in a local big box for years.Also, I find if I buy all my white sox the same it makes matching when washing easy!I recently purchase a pack of these in my local big box and something had changed as the quality was way off but after receiving these socks today from Amazon I am still okay with the Amazon version, I am wondering if the socks are a tiny bit thinner than a few years back but I can't tell,  I  did notice the retail packaging was a simple clear sealed bag and a cardboard insert showing the name and such. The bag before was printed on the bag so i'm not 100% whats going on with Hanes? Are these legit? Regardless these socks still look to be okay and I will continue to buy unless I can find a thicker better feeling sock.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,"The Hanes Men's Double Tough Crew Socks are a great addition to my everyday wardrobe. With a 12-pair pack, these socks offer exceptional value.

B00Y0NGBSS,We needed socks to take on vacation. We live in FL and rarely wear shoes that require socks. These were cheaper online than to buy directly in the store.  They are big on me but fit my son just fine. They really are very comfortable. I wear them around the house to keep my feet warm lol,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I needed some white socks. Nice white socks calf high I could wear with gyms or slacks with white gyms.  I saw 4 pair for $16. My wife said we could get 12 hane white socks for $11.83.  I argued how good could the be for less than a dollar a pair. You know who won that argument. They came yesterday and I tried a pair on. They were comfortable, soft and look great. I was out last night, it was 25 F and my feet were warm wearing gym shoes.  I got the size 9-11 and they fit my size 8 foot perfectly.  I am very happy and with all these white socks, just need some drawer space to fit them in.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I received the socks, but AMZN package TRACKING SYSTEM tells me that it got lost. It has occurred before also. AMZN need to fix the tracking system. The product is good.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,I wear my husband's old socks around the house. Lately they have gotten holes worn in them so I bought new socks for me. They fit a bit loose which I love. I'm happy with these!,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I got these for our shoebox ""Operation Christmas Child"" gifts! A great addition to the box that allows some comfort and protection.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,I thought I'd purchased 6 pairs of socks.  I was pleased to learn that actually this is a set of 12 pairs.  They seem to be solid enough.,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Worth the costVery comfortable,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I bought these for my blue collar husband, they were very functional for him who has a big foot. The comfort helped with him as he is on his feet all day. We need to restock soon!",4
B00Y0NGBSS,"They say women can never have too many shoes... well a man can never have too many pairs of socks. They get holes, they get lost to the sock graveyard and just seem to disappear from my sock drawer. These packs are a lifesaver with 12 pairs each. I purchased one pack of white and one black at a great price.  In my next review, I will talk about how well they wear or wear out. Just happy to have 24 pairs!!!!",5
B00Y0NGBSS,Very Good,5

B00Y0NGBSS,Good,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"These socks are standard Hanes crew socks. They work fine, but aren't as tight fitting or as breathable as the dri-fit version. If you're looking for a good boot sock on a budget, these work well.",5

B00Y0NGBSS,"These socks may look kinda tall, but they're perfect for my feet for cold weathers.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,I was in need of a heavy socks to wear with my work boots. Typically Hanes makes good products. They were a little light weight for me and the elastic in the top of the socks wasn't great. I gave them to my wife and she absolutely loves them!,4
B00Y0NGBSS,Would buy again,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Good quality great value,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"great socks, not great for narrow feet. after 4 hours of use i feel like im swimming in these socks, bought 6-11's and i wear 12 narrow..... womp womp.",4

B00Y0NGBSS,"Had no problems with these. They fit husband good. They kinda left black lent on his feet, but after a few washes that went away. Not too thick nor thin.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,Good,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Very comfy,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Hanes has always been my brand and this was a great buy,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"They are a bit of a loose fit for me and I usually wear shoes sizes 9.5-10.5. They are very comfortable and ""tough"".",5
B00Y0NGBSS,Soft Durable and Comfortable! 100% as described!,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"These are good quality and arrived on time. My one quibble is they're very long. I have to roll them down or they nearly reach my knees. But if you want long socks, you'll love these.",4
B00Y0NGBSS,Hanes socks were the perfect gift for my son. He looks forward to them each Christmas. The price and quality are unmatched.,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"This is the second time I have purchased these socks. I buy them for my boyfriend, he only likes to wear black crew socks so I do my best without breaking the bank. These socks are affordable and great quality. I might even purchase theses a third time, lets see how many he loses.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,"good fit, comfortable, price was right. Hopefully, they will be long-lasting.",5
B00Y0NGBSS,"These are a good quality sock, wear and hold up pretty well, Very comfortable when new, didn't hold up comfort wise over time. Note that I am fairly hard on socks and use these as daily socks in work boots. I would recommend, but wish they hold their comfort longer.",4
B00Y0NGBSS,Nice fit. Ok for bed n slippers!,4
B00Y0NGBSS,"SOX R SOX, BUT THERE NOT. ITS STUPID BUT THESE R THE PERFECT SOXS. NOT TOO TIGHT, OR LOOSE. THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF GIVE EVERWHERE U WANT THEM TO. THESE R GREAT SOXS",4

B00Y0NGBSS,"When I ordered these socks again, I realized that they lasted 3 years. That is actually 3 times longer than the regular Hanes crew socks.These socks are comfy but not particularly warm but that's fine for me.They are a great value for the money.",5

B00Y0NGBSS,"For years (decades), I wore white shoes and white socks for casual situations (97% of my life). My wife HATES white socks, even with white shoes, but certainly with non-white shoes.I have recently been wearing black casual shoes (some all black, some with white soles). These socks work very well as replacements for my everyday white socks. I have even taken to wearing them with black dress shoes, instead of dress socks. They are very comfortable subs for the dress socks.My wife, seeing me one time with black casual shoes and black socks, gave me two thumbs up.These socks are not seemingly as thick as the old white cotton crew socks I had been wearing, but they are better than some other polyester blend socks I tried out. Time will tell if they are as durable as my traditional white crew socks, but the approval of my wife outweighs their longevity.",4
B00Y0NGBSS,good product,4
B00Y0NGBSS,Christmas present for son.,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Product is decent quality.,4
B00Y0NGBSS,Can't complain on socks Hanes socks lol love them,5
B00Y0NGBSS,husband loves these socks,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Very comfortable when new but after washing a few times fabric started to pill. I've had socks from them before that never pilled.,5
B00Y0NGBSS,Item arrived as described,5
B00Y0NGBSS,The Rate is 5 stars.,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"Decent quality, it's good to have the same socks for both feet! This way it's so easy to keep in use at least one out of the pair ;)",5
B00Y0NGBSS,For 12 pairs i hate spending more than $20 so it was a way better value than my usual buy from wallyworld,4
B00Y0NGBSS,They seem to be holding up good fit his size 12 foot,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"I bought a pack of regular sized Hanes a year ago and they were good but tight.  Bought these in August for my size 12 feet and they are fantastic.  Easy to slip on and off my 84-year-old feet.  Both purchases have worn like iron and felt like silk. I have had expensive pairs, but these far surpassed them in comfort and wearability!I do not own stock in the company.David",5
B00Y0NGBSS,ComfortableGood for  boots,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"My local shelter was completely out of socks, had been for weeks. I thought in the summer this was no big deal till they educated me. On rainy days folks have wet socks, soaked shoes.  Dry socks protect their feet are key.These socks are a god value. Decent thickness so hopefully they don't wear out quickly. I don't think they will.I bought 1 pack of mens and 1 pack of womens. The shelter was delighted to receive them. Above all the other things I donated, the socks were the most appreciated.",4
B00Y0NGBSS,"Very thin ,was expecting a thicker sock  , for work",3
B00Y0NGBSS,I've worn these brand and style of socks for years. They are what my feet are most comfortable in. The latest pack I purchased seem to be a bit thinner than the older ones. Looks like Hanes is starting to cut some corners. But they are still very comfortable. I'm just guessing these won't last as long as the last pack I bought.,5
B00Y0NGBSS,"Love the socks, fits great",5
B00Y0NGBSS,As described they are made well.,5
B074MW1MTW,"I've traveled a lot all over the world, and always found that wearing compression socks made travel comfortable, especially through Southeast Asia where, for some reason, despite my having no circulatory issues, my ankles would swell. The old ones bit the dust, so I found these and am very happy with them. Often, compression socks are hard to get into, but these were so easy to put on and wear. They're great under slacks, fit well in my snoes and are very comfortable to wear. They can also be worn as fashion knee socks, if you're so inclined. Great seller, great priced, great arrival time and quality product.",5
B074MW1MTW,"Not large enough for my size 12 foot without cutting the toe area open so my toes can hang out for about 1.5 inches.  Since I am nursing a broken leg and mostly housebound for the next month that wasn't a huge big deal.  On the plus side, the compression did help reduce the swelling and the sock was comfortable after I opened the toe.  If you have 11 or greater shoe size and are unwilling to cut the toe area open you likely will find these to put an uncomfortable pressure on the tips of your toes.Maybe the manufacturer should create an XXL sized sock and also revise the size chart to be more realistic.  And, yes, I know these are compression socks.  The compression was perfect, but stretching the socks out to match my heel-to-toe length put an uncomfortable amount of linear force on my toes.",4
B074MW1MTW,"I was having foot issues whenever I had to work. It literally felt like my ankle on my left foot was beaten to a pulp by the time I finished my last shift Sunday nights into Monday mornings. I would hobble and limp for literally a day after I got off work Monday morning and got my boots off my feet. On a recommendation from my coworker, I started looking at compression socks and found these and thought they looked to be what I needed. I'll admit - at first, I wasn't impressed. The first weekend I used them, I still had the issue and was about to return them, but thought I would give it some time. That turned out to be the saving grace because over the next three weeks wearing them when I work, I have had NO issues with pain in my foot. I am so impressed with these that I am about to order another set so I don't have to keep wearing the same three pair every weekend. I can't say enough how much I like them and how much they made my life easier at work. The cost is really good and so far, these have held up great over the span of four washings - they still look almost new despite being on my feet 108 hours to that point total over three weekends at work and four wash cycles. And like I said, I am just about to order another set of them. If that isn't a high enough recommendation, I don't know what else I can say!",5
B074MW1MTW,"Love these socks. I weigh 235 and am under 6 ft tall. they fit great and stay up. Whoever says they are too short must have ""girraffe calfs"" because they go right up to my knees. I've washed them three times already and still holding together. I will update my review if they don't last. I do kind of doubt the copper content.",5
B074MW1MTW,"I searched through multiple compression socks and this was the best choice for me. They are very easy to put on even after washing. I wore them for about 5 hours, after taking them off I could tell the difference in my legs. The fluid was very minimal and there was no pressure in my legs. There were sock lines after removing. I put them on to go out in the snow, they are very comfortable and warm. I highly recommend.",5
B074MW1MTW,"Good compression socks.  Have only worn them for two days.  Do not know how they will wear.  I have used them for my everyday sock and for my walk.  I have washed one pair and it is drying now.  I have given four stars because they arrived in good time and were well packaged.  Also, they are comfortable and seem to be doing the job well.  I will know more after wearing them several times to see how they hold up to washing, repeated wearing, and hole prevention.  Good service from provider.",4
B074MW1MTW,"I have worn compression stockings for multiple decades on ""doctor's orders"" and have tried many brands. These are the closest to medical grade that I have come across. Strong even compression at about 15 to 20hg and I would say closer to 20+, they are tight for an average size leg. But, they are comfortable with good ankle compression and they are also on the longer side and have to folded at the knee for someone who is 5' 10."" Seem to be holding up very well after five machine washes, (cold wash, line dry.)  Be warned, these are tight/snug for an average foot/calf in the XL size in gray/black. I would/will reorder this exact item in the future.",5
B074MW1MTW,"The first 3pack I bought are great.I ordered another 3 pack in a different color. These socks were almost impossible to put on and the toe seam is bothersome as well as coming unraveled.Wish I would have tried them before washing so I could have returned.Too bad!UPDATE, AMAZON TOOK CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. I WILL GET THE SAME SOCKS THAT I ORDERED ORIGINALLY.GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE",5
B074MW1MTW,"They feel good, aren't hard to put on, or take off, and they stay up quite well. Would have given 5 stars, but 1 pair of them aren't as long as the other two pair, and they don't come up to the knee like the other 2 pair.",4
B074MW1MTW,Three pair nice they come packaged well .My leg has been hurting alot lately so I figure I give thes ba try to see if it helps and they seem to help some .They seem well made time will tell after some washings . They also have a good look  to them,4
B074MW1MTW,"They fit good, feel as much like real socks as opposed to compression socks and they are a really decent price on Amazon. I am pleased with my purchase.",5
B074MW1MTW,These socks are high quality & live up to the description. I work long hours & really help my energy til the end of the day. I highly recommend these socks.,5
B074MW1MTW,Love these socks.  They provide the compression I need.  They are gentle on my toes which is a plus since I have a hammertoe,5
B074MW1MTW,"I just wanted to try them, cause I have a knee replacement and with my regular socks  I always have a markon my leg where to sock stop's.  after using the copper Compression Socks, my legs' didn't have  marks andmy legs felt good and I felt no pain on my knee.  Usually my knee is lots of pain after a full day of walk andgoing from store to store.  Copper Compression Socks gave the support I needed for a full day of being onon my feet.",5
B074MW1MTW,They were very comfortable and I was able wear all day,4
B074MW1MTW,"Good socks, go up to knees. Firm compression, but not uncomfortable. I wear them all day. Reinforced toe and heel, arch support band.",5
B074MW1MTW,These socks are awesome.  I use them for hiking and cycling and they make a difference in fatigue and recovery.,5
B074MW1MTW,"Once you get them on they fit well and look good, but they're exceptionally difficult to put on. Very good quality.",4
B074MW1MTW,I ordered these compression socks very needed purchase. I highly recommend them.,5
B074MW1MTW,Husband tried supports from walmart but was crappy so bought these and helps tremendously.,5
B074MW1MTW,Socks fit good and feel great. They are worth the money spent.,5
B074MW1MTW,Very snug fit! Need strength to get them on!,5
B074MW1MTW,Shipped on time and was as described,5
B074MW1MTW,Order this to help with blood flow and reduce swelling after ankle ORIF.,5
B074MW1MTW,"Very comfortable, good quality.",5
B074MW1MTW,"Not too tight, not loose. Just what I needed. Just went through a illness and my feet and ankles have been swelling. These have helped. Would buy again.",4
B074MW1MTW,"I purchased these compression socks while training for a marathon because I noticed a bit of tightness/ discomfort in my Achilles tendons. My physical therapist recommended KT tape for support but I opted to try these first and they worked perfectly for me with no more achilliesissues since.  The pack of 3 cost less than a single pair of some and I appreciated all the positive reviews from other users which helped me make the decision to try them.  No regrets, I highly recommend and would definitely buy again.",5
B074MW1MTW,Perfect for a long day on your feet.,5
B074MW1MTW,"My kids both work jobs where they are on their feet and moving around for their entire shifts so I got these to help with leg and foot fatigue.  They just got them for Christmas so i don't know how they hold up yet, but I will post an update!  Thanks!",4
B074MW1MTW,These socks are easy to put on and they are very comfortable.  Clever two color design makes it easyto align the food and heel properly.,5
B074MW1MTW,These are comfortable and feel great on. They don't roll down my legs and  they stay in place all day.  I am extremely satisfied!,5
B074MW1MTW,do what should and quality is great.,5
B074MW1MTW,Quick delivery. Item as described. They are for my husband. They are easy to put on. He is happy,5
B074MW1MTW,Good quality,5
B074MW1MTW,"They fit, they feel good, the price is right.  I'll buy them again.  Wish they came in nude color.",5
B074MW1MTW,Used them after knee surgery. I guess they did the job...,5
B074MW1MTW,I like the easiness of pulling socks on. They are a little to long and go over knee then roll down which cuts into back of knee  price is just right. Hand wash easy. Compression is good,4
B074MW1MTW,"I know...it's the way they're supposed to be. I have a pair that I wear all the time because they're ""worn in""  and they're easy to get on and off. Of course they have to be snug to be effective and help the cause. These are good and well-made...I just need to give them a chance to break in. Usually I wear them at night when sleeping and then change to regular socks for daytime activities...that's how I live. Hope they work well for you. Don't order anything smaller than the L/XL unless you have legs like a child...my opinon. : )",4
B074MW1MTW,These were easier put on and take off and they did the job with only 15-20 mhg.,5
B074MW1MTW,My husband Loves these socks after having surgery.,5
B074MW1MTW,Great compression socks!,5
B074MW1MTW,Great! a reorder.,5
B074MW1MTW,Good quality for a great price.,5
B074MW1MTW,Good quality,5
B074MW1MTW,I ordered these compression socks because my doctor suggested them for my ankle and leg. So far I think there support has helped.,5
B074MW1MTW,Bought for my son and he loves them. He's on his feel all day on cement.  Fit well and has washed them a lot without any issues.  Highly recommend.,5
B074MW1MTW,the socks are good fit well,4
B074MW1MTW,My son is on his feet at least 12 hours a day. These socks prevent leg fatigue and support his veins.,4
B074MW1MTW,My feet didn't sweat or felt discomfort. These socks felt comfortable and cozy and when I had them on when I was asleep. I didn't notice they are on. I have problems with my feet. I love these socks.,5
B074MW1MTW,"I like , very comfortable",5
B074MW1MTW,"Pulled up completely these socks are long and go over the knee. I'm 5' 8.5"" and ordered the small-medium.The compression feel is mild except around the top band which is slightly tighter. There doesn't seem to be much compression in the foot or any added arch/ankle support.",4
B074MW1MTW,Great!  Third order,5
B074MW1MTW,These socks are excellent for travel on airplanes and they really do provide compression support.,5
B074MW1MTW,Nicely made. Fits great. Works as they should. No problems or issues,5
B074MW1MTW,"They arrived yesterday - I'm so glad they did.  They are soft, comfortable, and thin - not bulky in my shoes like others can be - strongly recommend.",5
B074MW1MTW,"Today 12/11/24, I'm q bus driver and my girlfriend told me to get these to help prevent bad health issues and to have more comfort on my feet and so far they feel amazing the palm of my feet don't feel as tired, have to wait and see how long they last",4
B074MW1MTW,Product came exactly as advertised,5
B074MW1MTW,"I've worn other compression socks, but these are the best so far. Thin but tough. Comfortable and does a great job.  I have 6 pair and have been using them just about daily for weeks.",5
B074MW1MTW,"I actually tried to cancel this order because I did not know how well it would work for me. Glad I didn't or could not due to my lack of where with all. One - love the colors, two - as advertised, comfortable even when I thought I bought the wrong size. (I did not.) Three - I would buy again because of the comfort of these socks and gives me help. :)",5
B074MW1MTW,Super nice feeling and fitting socks for an awesome price,5
B074MW1MTW,Fit great.,5
B074MW1MTW,"Not too much compression, easy to put on and work great as I am on my feet most of the day. Eliminates swelling and tired feet",5
B074MW1MTW,"Helps my legs from swelling. I wear them everyday. For walking, working. And exercise. They real help me out a lot.",5
B074MW1MTW,Great colors!,5
B074MW1MTW,Easy to put on. Good quality. Would buy again.,5
B074MW1MTW,They work very well and are comfortable and well priced.,5
B074MW1MTW,Very good,5
B074MW1MTW,Good product for the price.  Lower compression than higher priced article but seem to work okay for venous reflux.,4
B074MW1MTW,"I have been experiencing only the slightest bit of edema in my ankles and legs at the end of the day.  So it  was a good opportunity to explore apparel that would aid.  The socks appear to be good construction and quality material.  The fit has been perfect with no sag or bunching.  And it appears to reduce the swelling at the end of the day.  I would debate the value of ""copper infused"" sections as that never did much to remedy the aches in my hands from the gloves marketed by other companies.  Overall, good value.",5
B074MW1MTW,Fit my kankles and helped with swelling,5
B074MW1MTW,"The only thing i have to gripe about with them is that they make my feet slide around in my shoes. This isn't usually an issue but when I'm riding BMX at a skatepark, it hurts to have your toes slam forward on riding every time. Other than that, they fit well and do their job well.",4
B074MW1MTW,These are stockings are relatively easy to use and very consistent in fit and feel as well as comfortable,5
B074MW1MTW,"I've tried other brands size L-XL and this one is a bit tight around the top. I had to make adjustments halfway through my shift, but otherwise it's a good pair!",4
B074MW1MTW,"Bought these for my husband post knee surgery to contain the swelling. Good quality, not too tight like some we have purchased that are hard to put on. Comfortable to wear and came with a few in a pack so the price was right.",5
B074MW1MTW,I was having trouble finding compression socks as my foot is smaller than my calves.  I also have a wider front of the foot compared to heel.  I wear any shoe between a 4.5-6 women's depending on cut.  These socks were perfect.  Other compression socks have 1in of extra material in the heel.  I bought a S/M.,5
B074MW1MTW,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is the first pair of compression socks that have actually worked for me.  I've had three surgeries on my right foot (Hallux Rigidus) grand toe joint, along with neuropathy and severe osteoarthritis in both feet and ankles.  These socks are easy to put on and provide enough room in my toes where they do not feel smashed together causing more pain.  I bought a L/XL and they fit perfect, even though my lower legs and feet are more of a medium. My feet are wider since my surgeries.  They are not difficult to get off as long as I roll them down first, plant my thumb in the heel area, and slowly pull down and off.  I have arthritis in my wrists so I take it slow, but it's doable.  I can wear these socks most of the day without any discomfort.  I've even walked around the mall without leg and foot pain. I don't really know a lot about copper so I don't know if it's the copper or the compression but whichever,  I highly recommend FuelMeFoot Copper Compression Socks.",5
B074MW1MTW,Good socks,4
B074MW1MTW,My husband has RLS and when he wears these all day while working he says his legs definitely feel better at the end of the day. Would purchase again.,5
B074MW1MTW,They are comfortable and not too tight,5
B074MW1MTW,Very well liked!,5
B074MW1MTW,Very easy to put on/off.,5
B074MW1MTW,Work very well,5
B00D1ARZMC,"It's Hanes so I expect it to be good, but these are up there with some of the more comfortable undershirts I wear.  They are light weight, but not so thin that they do nothing.  They hide well under my dress shirt and the collar doesn't have any of the ""bacon"" neck issues that some cheaper brands seem to get.  Great value for what you get!",5
B00D1ARZMC,"Hello All,The Hanes Men's Cotton Set of 3 Undershirts are very comfortable and smooth to the touch and feel when worn. I appreciated the Thin nature of this undershirt especially now that the Winter Season is upon us. When wearing them outside here in central Florida 2 layers of clothing are a must for certain colder winter days. Don't laugh, our blood gets thinner during the winter months here in Florida.The shirts are expertly assembled finding not even a single loose thread or dangling threads for that matter on any of the multipack shirts. The price of the multipack set of 3 shirts may be a bargain price compared to the other competitor shirts on the market. But, Hanes doesn't skimp on the quality here either folks.",5
B00D1ARZMC,They feel good and are long which I like. Real question is durability seeing as how they feel very thin compared to some other brands I bought. Will see how long they last compared to the other brands. Did not shrink in the wash and feels good around the neckline.,4
B00D1ARZMC,"Everyone knows cotton will shrink, so buy one size larger,  but to my surprise, they didn't shrink that much. There made very well. My son really liked how comfortable they were. He works in these tee shirts , they wash nice , colors never faded, they kept there shape,after several washings. Great value for the money.  They will last a long time. I'd buy them, again .",5
B00D1ARZMC,Love the value.  I do planet fitness lifting 2 or 3 times per week.  Bought medium over 60 and like to sleep in these shirts.  After washing just feel a bit tight around arms & chest.,5
B00D1ARZMC,"Very nice t-shirts for hubby for a gift. Just by feeling them i already know that They will be very comfortable for him, n are very soft. The fit looks like it will be great for him.",5
B00D1ARZMC,the Tshirts are of great quality as they are made of cotton and will last a long time.  These do tend to run a little larger than the label states.,4
B00D1ARZMC,"Actually 3 1/2 stars.  Order 1 size up.  These shrink a lot!  They don't wick as well as we liked, but it was a great price and they're better than other tees.",4
B00D1ARZMC,The price is right but the quality is lower than I assumed.,4
B00D1ARZMC,Wish I could find in a large quantity at a great price. The product was as described.,4
B00D1ARZMC,I'm a Medium size tee-shirt but these were snug ... will donate. Order Large Hanes tees in 100% cotton.,4
B00D1ARZMC,"I'm a woman and ordered these for myself to use for sweaty/dirty work. It's hard to find 100% cotton women's shirts, and they cost way more than men's shirts. Because I expected some shrinkage after washing, I ordered medium (normally I'd wear men's small). Before washing, they were pretty boxy on me. I washed on delicate/cold and dried on low (until they were completely dry). They shrunk a bit in all dimensions (sleeves, width, length) and fit pretty well now, just slightly looser than I would expect most women's mediums to fit. I have a long torso and these are a good length to keep everything covered when bending and crouching.The label says 100% cotton and that feels accurate to the touch. Not the softest, but not scratchy. Definitely not moisture-wicking, which makes sense because they don't contain synthetic materials. I don't know why the listing states that it's moisture-wicking. Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase, but I wish they made a comparable shirt for women with a more fitted cut and no pink tax.",4
B00D1ARZMC,Nice tshirt but a bit thin.,4
B00D1ARZMC,"They are really white, quality is good after washing, fit to size, weight is as expected, functions well on or under another shirt,mflattering to the figure",5
B00D1ARZMC,like the fit and the material would recommend. sized correctly for me as well,5
B00D1ARZMC,This is a decent t-shirt but it could be softer. I normally buy Jockey t-shirts but I thought I'd give Hanes a try this time because they are cheaper. Turns out Jockey is much softer and more comfortable than Hanes. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll be going back to Jockey because I believe the extra cost is worth it.,4
B00D1ARZMC,Great fabric quality and soft. Worth the buy,5
B00D1ARZMC,My son loved these under shirts,5
B00D1ARZMC,Good Value and Comfortable for my husband to wear.,5
B00D1ARZMC,These shirts fit well. I need longer torso and these fit the bill.,5
B00D1ARZMC,Nice cotton shirts with only flaw being the length of sleeves. The sleeves are way to short.,4
B00D1ARZMC,Between my husband and my son they go through tee shirts and I continue to buy this brand.,5
B00D1ARZMC,"Bought for bf. He loves the fit nd feel. Non shrinking. The quality is great, the weight is perfect",5
B00D1ARZMC,"Thin shirt for sleeping in and keeps you dry, true to size and they wash & dry without shrinking.",4
B00D1ARZMC,"Always on his Christmas list ! Husband says are comfortable, good quality and just what he needs. Wash well",5
B00D1ARZMC,"Not as quality as the Gildan tees I usually buy. These feel a little thinner, a little lighter. Not quite see-through but getting there.Still good value considering the low price for a few tees that will last a little while, but i would definitely like to see them a little thicker like the Gildan tees",4
B00D1ARZMC,Bought these for my husband. Good quality and he is pleased with them.,4
B00D1ARZMC,white undershirts for work . are a little bigger then the regular size I wear but work great for work.,5
B00D1ARZMC,Good under shirt,5
B00D1ARZMC,"The shirts were good and came in time, but they literally slapped the shipping label on the actual packaging and did not put it in any other package so it got black through the hole that is there so you can feel how soft the shirt is. The black is not coming out either. They need to put it in another plastic bag to ship.",4
B00D1ARZMC,"Comfortable, familiar, white T-shirts I wear them at night to go to bed",5
B00D1ARZMC,"the fit is just right...not too short on body or arms like other undershirts and not thin either. Can be worn underneath or as a shirt itself. I lost a star because one got holes in it after one wash while the others were still as day 1 so not sure what happened there. Maybe something that got passed inspection? Otherwise, happy with them",4
B00D1ARZMC,Doesn't shrink like normal clothes it's really light fabric though I like a little thicker but it's really great,4
B00D1ARZMC,"Good quality shirt , but overall lost two of them to the washer , they get ripped easily , especially in the armpit area . I only use them as undershirts , so not sure why they cannot last longer . Overall , the quality is better than fruit or other brand , but the durability can be improved.",4
B00D1ARZMC,The quality of this brand is top notch. Husband has been wearing the crew neck shirts forever. Good price for the 6 pack of T-shirts,5
B00D1ARZMC,Nice,5
B00D1ARZMC,exactly what I expected. True to size. The shirts are light weight and fit well. exactly what I expected. I recommend and I will order more.,5
B00D1ARZMC,"One arrived with a roughly dime sized hole in lower back area of shirt.Would love for someone (company)to reach out to me regarding this, I find it quite unusual.",4
B00D1ARZMC,Nice t-shirts...but the collars could use some thicker material or just a wider design...since they start stretching too soon.,4
B00D1ARZMC,My husband loves wearing this under his work shirts.I love the quantity of the shirts that come in it.,5
B00D1ARZMC,"They are very comfortable, they don't wrinkle orOr they fit big and this is very good the model I loved something like that I was looking for a lot and this very well I love it",5
B00D1ARZMC,"Purchased for son, great brand!",5
B00D1ARZMC,"Its a little thinner than I was hoping for. I have other t-shirts 100% cotton  that are thicker than these are, so if you're expecting a thick warm t-shirt, this may not be it.  If you hold  these up to a lamp, you can see right through it. My other 100% cotton T-shirts with the same test, you can't see the light through those t-shirts. I gave it 4 stars though for the price.",4
B00D1ARZMC,I have bought these shirts before they fit great and are comfortable and are great price.,5
B00D1ARZMC,Both these for my hubby who is starting a new job and his dress attire has changed. He needed undershirts and is very pleased with the fit and comfort the provide,5
B00D1ARZMC,Worked great. Cleans well.,5

B00D1ARZMC,"ITEM IS NICE, AND HAS VERY GOOD  QUALITY. RECOMMENDED SELLER",5
B00D1ARZMC,"My husband needed shirts these shirt where so white and great quality they look so good and it was such a great price for the amount you get, very light",5
B00D1ARZMC,Who can pass up a deal? The price was perfect for the number of tees and Hanes is known for quality.  Hanes socks and tees are a part of my Christmas tradition that I cannot change.,5
B00D1ARZMC,Fits as expected,4
B00D1ARZMC,Excelent t~shirt,5
B00D1ARZMC,These cotton t-shirts are medium weight and true to size. They are perfect to wear under scrubs but could be worn alone.,5

B00D1ARZMC,"great, buy them every year",5
B00D1ARZMC,"Not the best I have had but they did the job.  I sleep in them.  They are a bit too thin to wear out of the house, I am a woman and your bra would be front and center; but they get the job done.",4
B00D1ARZMC,"Sleeves are a little short but not too bad. It took a few washes to soften them up. not very thick, which is nice. printed tag.",4
B00D1ARZMC,Well delivered on time. Thanks,4
B00D1ARZMC,"Great product, great price.",5
B00D1ARZMC,The Quality Is Good For The Price,5

B00D1ARZMC,Will buy again,5
B00D1ARZMC,"Fits to size,  good material and light weight, just wash and air dry.  Good to wear under polo shirts or sweaters.",5
B00D1ARZMC,Love these shirts. Soft and moisture wicking. Highly recommend,5
B00D1ARZMC,Basic white tees. Great value for the money,5
B00D1ARZMC,I had to say that for the price the quality of the t shirt a quite good,5
B00D1ARZMC,These are well made and comfortable. This is also a good value.,5
B00D1ARZMC,"Tela muy delgada, parece que se va a romper al segundo uso",5
B00D1ARZMC,Fit and value for money is great,5
B00D1ARZMC,"Comfort, Quality and Value...package of 6.",5
B00D1ARZMC,"For the price, it's worth it for everyday use. Material is a bit rough at first but improves when washed and placed in the drier. You get what you pay for thing.",4
B00D1ARZMC,It's so smooth and stretch . I like the tissue you can wear it at any because you ll be so comfortable with it . The color is so nice. It's very light.,5
B00D1ARZMC,"Definetly comfortable, I buy these to wear under my scrubs because I sweat a lot, works great!",4
B00D1ARZMC,"can only give 4 stars, bought as a gift, but they are soft",4
B00D1ARZMC,Cool,5
B00D1ARZMC,"I recently purchased a 3-pack of white shirts, and overall, they serve their purpose well as undershirts.Firstly, let's talk about the material. The shirts are made of a thin fabric, which makes them ideal for layering underneath other clothing. They are lightweight and breathable, which is perfect for wearing under dress shirts or sweaters without adding bulk.In terms of sizing, I found that they look a bit big when you first take them out of the packaging. However, once worn, they fit pretty close to the expected size. They provide a comfortable fit without being overly tight or restrictive.The quality of the shirts is decent for the price. While they may not be the most durable shirts for everyday wear on their own, they hold up well as undershirts. The stitching seems sturdy, and after a few washes, they have maintained their shape and color.One thing to note is that because they are white shirts, they may require more frequent washing to keep them looking crisp and clean.Overall, if you're looking for affordable, basic white shirts primarily for layering purposes, this 3-pack is a good option. They are comfortable, fit well once worn, and serve their intended function as undershirts effectively. I would recommend them for anyone needing reliable undershirts without breaking the bank.",4
B00D1ARZMC,Nice and softGood collars stand up,5
B00D1ARZMC,"I had hoped these would be a bit thicker, but they're sufficient. Soft and comfy. I'm on the taller end and if they shrink over time they'll be a bit short on me, so fingers crossed.",4
B08P1P72H8,"These joggers are great. Lightweight and fairly stretchy (but not too much), comfortable, fit to my size (S) perfectly and the color matched the photos. I'm 6' tall and 150 lbs but I'm sure they would still fit someone my height or somewhat shorter with a bigger waist and legs just fine. I will be ordering more colors right away. Definitely worth the extra $10 or $20 over the cheap ones on here.",5
B08P1P72H8,"For some reason, I have two pairs of these joggers in the same size (XXL) but they fit much different. The pair I have in Dark Khaki was the first pair I bought earlier this year and they fit PERFECT for me at 5'11"" 260lbs. The second pair I got in Navy just last week are much more tight, almost like a slim fit. It makes no sense to me. I loved the first pair but the same exact product in a different color fits different? I don't know if I'd want to buy more if that's an issue. 3 stars because I'm meeting in the middle for the two pairs I own.",3
B08P1P72H8,"These are, without a doubt, the best joggers I've ever worn. They are perfect on warm or cooler days, to lounge around the house, run errands, or workout in. The pockets could be a bit deeper, but all the other aspects (breathable, stretchy, super comfortable) make up for it. Get a pair, you won't regret it.",5
B08P1P72H8,"I bought these for my husband because he was trying to find some gym pants that were comfortable. He's thick and I had to size up to the XXL but he said they are super comfortable, he can stretch and squat and it doesn't feel like they will slide down or rip. Really good stretch and said they are a warm material (we live in South Louisiana so don't read too much into that if you're up North!). Hopefully they last him a long time, but they seem to be well worth the $30!",5
B08P1P72H8,"I've been getting a lot of Fabletics clothes recently, but this has changed the game for me. True to size and so comfortable. Comfort is big for me and so is my time, so having these fit so perfectly the first time has made me a customer for life!",5
B08P1P72H8,"These are my new everything pants! They are extremely comfortable, versatile, and stylish. I've done everything in them from taking a nap to working out. After I put my 1st pair, I bought 5 more. They even have zippers to keep stuff from falling out while being more active.I love 'em!",5
B08P1P72H8,"It's difficult to find a reasonably priced jogger because a lot are made of cotton and end up pilling. These are free of this issue. They're comfortable, stretchy, and have zippers on all the pockets which I like. I ordered one as a test and they passed that test easily so I just placed an order for 9 more because I want to have plenty to work out in. I don't go to the gym so idk about how trendy these may be but these are practical and well build pants; great for my home gym!",5
B08P1P72H8,"These are a good value work out pants with nice zipper pockets and a good long drawstring, the bottoms are cuffed but fit easily over my feet. The mediums are a bit large for me, (I usually wear a 33x29 or 32x30 dress pant) but still work for the gym. When I loose some weight again I'll try the small which is probably a better size for me.",5
B08P1P72H8,Perfect fit!! Love the material. They are anti dog hair collector! Silky enough where you can just wipe it off with your hand and not need a lint roller!! Ordered 3 pairs!!,5
B08P1P72H8,"Comfortable, but too baggy for my workouts, I usually train with Straight Leg Joggers or Skinny Fit Joggers for dudes.",4
B08P1P72H8,"Extremely comfortable... I sized up one, from a medium to large for a looser fit in the legs and thighs. 33 waist, 5'-10"" ,175 pounds.Also, waaaaaay better value then some of the bigger name brands",5
B08P1P72H8,These fit and feel great.  Super comfortable and versatile.  You'll be happy with your purchase.,5
B08P1P72H8,"I love the material.  These are very comfortable.  The zippers are great for carrying your phone keys, wallet.",5
B08P1P72H8,"The fabric stays up, is comfortable and can be worn to the store.  Zippers work well and welcome safety feature.",5
B08P1P72H8,I love the material and the fit,5
B08P1P72H8,"I got couple of different colors in the same size. Had to return the others except the black. It was the only one that fit well. The rest did not.Now, the one that did fit well fit really well and look good. Would recommend trying out a couple of different sizes and find the one that fits well. It is comfortable and retains colors.",4
B08P1P72H8,"These are my go-to pants for outdoor exercise or going to the gym.  Also, put them on for lounging around the house or a quick trip to the store.  True to size, light weight, yet well made.  Recommend 100%",5

B08P1P72H8,"Great material, very comfortable. Very functional for crossfit workouts.",5
B08P1P72H8,I liked the fit which is slim.the color gray  is good.I like the elastic waist and at the ankle.It seems to have  good seams and material.Easy to clean and maintain.,5
B08P1P72H8,"His was a Christmas gift for one of my  sons.  Very flexible, has  2 front pockets with zippers & a back pocket with zipper.  Comfortable  cuffs & look  very good .",5
B08P1P72H8,I recently purchased 2 pairs of G Gradual jogger sweatpants with zipper pockets. I instantly fell in love them and they have become my favorite pants to wear. They are on par with other expensive joggers I own. They are are definitely a very good value for the money. The sizes seem to be accurate. These are extremely comfortable and light weight joggers yet seem to made with quality materials. I have loved having them as my full time gym pants and are also very flexible and easy to maneuver In. I would highly recommend these to anyone interested in buying jogger pants.,5
B08P1P72H8,Look great on husband. Super soft. Great pockets... zip up and contents fit nice inside.,5

B08P1P72H8,Really nice running pants.,5
B08P1P72H8,Good,5
B08P1P72H8,I got these for my husband after seeing them recommended by a blogger. My husband finds them really comfortable and lightweight. He asked for a second pair!,5
B08P1P72H8,"I enjoy running and, this time of year, it gets colder especially in the mornings. I needed something to cover my legs and these were perfect!  I have short legs so finding something that doesn't bunch up at the ankles is difficult. These are great because they clasp tightly at the ankles and not too much excess fabric.  They look really good and keep my legs warm; so, mission accomplished.  I plan to buy another pair.",5
B08P1P72H8,Love the soft material and medium fit.  Great for lounging or jogging.  The zipper pockets are good for keys and phone.  I have a black and olive pair.  Good purchase!,5
B08P1P72H8,Nice material...deep pockets with zipper great fit high price but worth it,5
B08P1P72H8,I bought for my husband. He loves them. I bought almost every color they have. Comfortable and true to size,5

B08P1P72H8,Comfortable and fit nicely. Great for bicycling.,5
B08P1P72H8,I like these pants. They are comfortable. They are a thin polyester type material but work well at gym and wearing around the house. They fit true to size. I would recommend this product.,5
B08P1P72H8,"The fit was perfect  for this 5'6 "" 132 lb.",5
B08P1P72H8,"Fit very well and not loose. My weight constantly changes so I bought medium, large, and XL. I very between 183-203 with 34-36 waist. The XL across the board is most comply and keep me warm all year. The quality is great must have washed 30 times and still fit the same. The zippered from pockets a plus! Drawn string is rope quality.",5
B08P1P72H8,Great product. I like the material and the zippered pockets. Looks and feels great too. I would buy this product again. If the tie strings were on the inside I would consider these perfect.,5
B08P1P72H8,"As a plus size customer, I really like the feel of them. They fit perfectly. I love how flexible they are as you work. I work in a warehouse and these pants are the best I have. The deep pockets are perfect. They wash really well.",5
B08P1P72H8,Perfect fit and very comfortable for my tennis in icy cold weather,5

B08P1P72H8,He said he loves them.,5
B08P1P72H8,Cant see spending 70 to 100 on joggers?! Me either! I'm 5ft 10 240 lbs and work out 4 to 6 times a week. I have big athletic legs and butt that won't fit reg jeans. I have to buy stretch jeans to fit anything these days. I also started jogging distance over the last few months. However I live in the Midwest and now it's getting cold so I was in the market for joggers.These fit great! I got xxl and material seems of high quality.  It was 50 degrees here today and I was very comfortable in these. So much so I put 3 more colors in my cart before typing this review! I just hope they hold up through the laundry for years to come. Def a buy if you are interested.,5
B08P1P72H8,Love these.  have bought like 6 pairs,5
B08P1P72H8,Great quality pants,5

B08P1P72H8,"Everything about these jogger pants is great. They are perfect for the gym or lounging around. The material is holding up well, there are no fuzz balls.",5
B08P1P72H8,"I'm 5'9"" with a 31"" waste and 32"" inseem and these in Large fit perfectly. There's just the perfect amount of ankle sag so when I sit down they don't ride up on the lower portion of my ankle. This is important when I ride. The fabric is ""Sheer"" feeling and quite nice but still very ""cozy"". I bought the dark camo and they look super chill.",5
B08P1P72H8,I love the way they fit and the feel of the material is great. I'll definitely be getting another pair.,5

B08P1P72H8,High quality,5
B08P1P72H8,"Can't express how much I love these joggers.  First off the fabric is lite, stretchy and has a buttery soft feel to it.  3 zippered pockets come in handy.  Quality stitching.  I teach yoga and absolutely love these pants.  The fabric on these are very thin and it's a slim fit.  If you want a thicker fabric go with the golf joggers.",5
B08P1P72H8,"Purchased the G Gradual Men's Sweatpants (Joggers) in XXL, and I'm pleased with their performance. As a 5'9"", 232lb man with a 43"" hip measurement, finding sweatpants that comfortably fit under my stomach at my hips without being too tight and too long has been a consistent challenge. The XXL size of these sweatpants manages to provide a perfect fit, comfortably accommodating my build without any of the uncomfortable and unsightly tightness around the butt or in the crotch area that I experienced with the XL size.The pants feature a mid-rise waist that sits about 2.25 inches below the navel, ensuring a secure and flattering fit that's neither too tight nor too loose. The front rise and overall design offer enough room in the crotch for comfortable movement without any restrictive feel. With a 29"" inseam, the length is ideal, covering the ankle just right without any stacking, suitable for various activities and settings.Constructed from a midweight knit poly fabric, these pants strike a balance between comfort and function. The poly material is soft and airy, promising adequate breathability in warmer temperatures, although it might not provide sufficient warmth in colder, windy conditions. Despite lacking a traditional gusset, the pants are cut well between the legs, allowing for enhanced mobility similar to high-priced Lululemon ABC pants.I've found these to be perfect for running errands and lounging at home, thanks to their versatile casual look that pairs well with T-shirts or hoodies. For stocky builds seeking sweatpants that offer a great mix of style, comfort, and practical design, the G Gradual joggers are a good option. Their thoughtful fit at the hips, appropriate front rise, and comfortable crotch fit make them highly recommended for athletic pants that don't compromise on fit or comfort.",4
B08P1P72H8,Perfect,5
B08P1P72H8,Bought for 2 different grandsons. Boys don't want to wears Jean's all the time anymore.  Got a great black Friday price and delivered quickly. Look really nice think they will love them. Daughter-in-law suggested.  Good choice.,5
B08P1P72H8,Very nice sweatpants with zipped pockets.,5
B08P1P72H8,These are comfortable and great quality. I ordered him another pair in another color. TTS.,5
B07543D21Q,"Love these compression socks. They fit perfectly and make my legs feel energised and supported. Size is fantastic. Socks go right up to my knees and the foot gives plenty of room without being too big. I've worn them every day since receiving them. Original order was delivered to an unknown address (not my home) which wasn't Amazon's fault, but they immediately shipped new ones to me at no charge.These socks aren't meant for very tight compression for people who need more support, but for me, they're perfect. Well made and comfy and the colours (black, blue, grey and white) are exactly what I needed. Thanks Amazon and the manufacturer for these socks.",5
B07543D21Q,"My legs and feet have given me trouble for all of my 77 years, so I'll try anything to make them work better. Five years ago, I had hip replacement surgery on my right leg, so I encountered yet MORE problems! I can no longer cross my right leg over my left. In fact, I can barely lift the right leg.So...I needed my ""sock puller"" to put these on. That was a bit of a struggle. These are NOT soft like Jockey or Gold Toe socks AT ALL. The material is ""hard"" to the touch (I presume it needs to be). Once one, I work these to bed all night, and was comfortable EXCEPT in the toes, which were too tight. Trying to loosen them was difficult, and the material ""bunches up"" a lot in the toes (again, not like good premium socks). Still, I slept OK, and was not bothered by the compression on my ""Popeye""-like bulging calves.Moring arrived. Time to take them OFF. If you live alone, that may be a BIG problem. I'm not especially agile. I can have difficulty removing ordinary socks from my right foot, because I can't cross my right leg. This time, the task was IMPOSSIBLE. Thankfully, my wife pulled the right sock off, but only with considerable effort. So, that's the first and last test of compression socks for me. It's not the maker's fault...by intentional design, they just don't work for me. However, my wife said, ""Let me try them."" She hasn't yet. So I have no conclusion except this: If you've never tried compression socks, and have no one to give them to, or help you take them on and off, you may want to return them...especially if you've had one or both hip joints replaced. The product itself was the largest size, well-made, and arrived as expected. Just one star off therefor for not working out for me, personally. Too bad, but I don't blame anyone.",4
B07543D21Q,"I found that stronger, 20-30 mmHg socks were extremely difficult to put on and take off.  These 15-20 mmHg socks provide support that prevents lower leg swelling, and yet are relatively easy to put on and take off.",5
B07543D21Q,"I love these socks.  I am diabetic and hoping to increase the circulation in my feet.  These socks are gorgeous and full of pizzazz, but also very comfortable.",5
B07543D21Q,"These are comfortable and stretchy enough to fit me well and provide gentle compression. I'm 5'3"", with a 7.5"" foot and 16.5"" calf. The S/M is just right for me. I often have trouble with compression socks being too big in the foot, too tight on the calf, and/or too long, but these fit perfectly",5
B07543D21Q,"I wasn't a big believer when people recommended compression socks.  Ever since I got pregnant, I started looking for a pair, not thinking it would make a difference.  I drive a lot in my job, which means a lot of sit and feet down, so my doctor recommended I get a pair. I did, I was hesitant. After using a couple of times, I noticed the difference.  It doesn't feel snug at all, it just makes sure your blood gets going even if you sit for longer periods.  I even got my Mom a pair.I used those too for postpartum. After I had my baby, my legs and feet were HUGE!!  I used my compression socks, and by drinking lots of water and socks, I had my feet back in two days.",5
B07543D21Q,I love these compression socks. I used these socks when I was pregnant to prevent my legs and ankles to swell and it helped a ton. I still use them postpartum to reduce any excess fluid from the IV and it truly reduced it to normal in a couple of days. These are like medical grade compression socks. It also prevents any varicose veins on your legs and veins to bulky form. In general all compression socks are impegnar and do the job if you orse right size.,5
B07543D21Q,"These have been working well to keep our ankles, feet, & calves from swelling & cramping. Not heavy, not too thick for our shoes, can easily be put on & removed (many we've tried are a struggle!), wash & dry well. We've bought many pairs - VERY reasonably priced, & have never had an issue with orders, with supply, or shipping. Would Definitely recommend if you're using a moderate to light weight compression sock!",5
B07543D21Q,"My husband ordered these for an upcoming long flight and most sock don't come up far enough but these do, the only complaint I had was not about the product itself but the internal packaging.  The Amazon packaging was fine but when I opened it up the ""box"" the socks were in was in pieces like it got caught in a conveyor belt incident, if I had to return this you couldn't even piece the box back together and some of the other items in my order also had the same issue.",4
B07543D21Q,My legs were swelling some and I had toe and leg cramps.  They are gone now.  I have my husband and daughter wearing them also.  We have tried other brands.  They were not comfortable.,5
B07543D21Q,The socks looks smart and they're very  comfortable and fit well.The sizing is slightly loose though so I'd order a size down from my normal size.,4
B07543D21Q,These are so easy to put on and comfortable to wear that they would be my go-to socks even if I did not need compression socks. They do not slide down like regular socks do.,5
B07543D21Q,"The hospital gave me a pair. Well, l was always fighting with them because the socks were cutting in too my leg. These socks are great!  Good fit! Didn't mind wearing them. All around great product.",5
B07543D21Q,"I ordered these for an upcoming LONG flight, just to be on the safe side. They're quite comfortable and not too restrictive. They seem well made and the colors are nice. Glad I bought them.",5
B07543D21Q,"I have worn the socks for a month now. No major issue, one tear. The problem is finding the right sock that will give me the right amount of compression and how long will the sock last? I have tried numerous brands of compression socks and found many of the compression socks to be cheap or not as firm as advertised. Finding the right compression sock is difficult because every item sold on Amazon is rated 4 stars or better. The search continues.",4
B07543D21Q,These are great socks for work. Third time buying and they last about two years. Good quality.,4
B07543D21Q,"I have vienous stasis, so i need these socks.  I only wish they were not synthetic.  Cotton would be best.",4
B07543D21Q,"They make my tired legs feel great and rejuvenated.  Went on easier than a previously purchased brand, but still gave calves a gentle relaxing hug!!",5
B07543D21Q,"I bought the black &gold XL compression socks for my husband.  He's finally getting some relief.  They stay over his calves all night long.  Compression without cutting off circulation.  He really likes them.  I bought a 3 pack with cats, hearts and stripes.  I'm very happy with them too.",5
B07543D21Q,I had foot surgery and the surgeon wants me to wear compression socks for several months. These socks fit well. They do come up to just below the knee and are not binding at the top. Cute patterns. They wash well and fit the same after drying.,5
B07543D21Q,They do the job: prevent ankle swelling after 12 hours of wear AND do not cut through my skin.,5
B07543D21Q,Perfect!  Had leg pain. Have now purchased these twice. These really work as the pain is gone.,5
B07543D21Q,They do the job!,4

B07543D21Q,They worked great. I had to order a xtra large because of my calf size so the toe part was too long But no complaints.,4
B07543D21Q,"Work well, Easy  to get on, wear well,  i love them",5
B07543D21Q,They are heavy. but still are reasonably easy to pull up.,4

B07543D21Q,"Wear daily for work. They hold up well, and color does not fade.",5
B07543D21Q,Very comfortable,4
B07543D21Q,I bought XL.  Used on 13 hour plane trips and do their job. Essential if your older,5
B07543D21Q,Just the right amount of compression to fit my needs. The socks are stylish and very well made.,5
B07543D21Q,"I originally bought these to wear on an international flight and wore them the entire trip.  Just enough compression.  Toe area is a little too boxy like a tube sock, but as long as your shoe isn't too tight these inexpensive socks do the trick.  My go to socks for taking walks and shopping.",4
B07543D21Q,"They stay up and they are not too tight. I wash them in the washer, but let them air dry.",5
B07543D21Q,I have stasis dermatitis in my feet and legs caused by poor circulation.  One of the treatments the doctor gave me is to wear compression stockings,5

B07543D21Q,I have to wear compression stockings because of an ulcer on my leg. These work great. Just enough compression without digging into my leg.,5
B07543D21Q,Great for petite women since they are not too long for shorter legs! These socks stay up all day as my jobs keep me walking throughout the day. They offer a mild & comfortable level of compression.,5
B07543D21Q,"I am a warehouse sanitation worker and am on my feet for 10 hours a day. I also have multiple foot, ankle and knee issues. I, up until yesterday, had a gout flare up.

B07543D21Q,Just perfect!  Easy to put on and take off!,5
B07543D21Q,"I am SO glad that I made this purchase! I started to notice swelling immediately after giving birth, which wasn't something I experienced with my first 2 pregnancies. However, even after just ONE day/night of wearing these compression socks, I felt and saw a noticeable difference in my legs!! I continued to wear them daily for the week following delivery and started to feel and look back to my normal self very quickly! I purchased the 3 pack option to make laundry a little easier for me, but it would be worth it to buy a week's worth for sure! Definitely recommend! I am a size 7 shoe for reference and got the smaller option - fit perfectly.",5
B07543D21Q,My husband wears these and he says they are perfect.,5
B07543D21Q,Great fit and comfort.  This is the only compression sock I have been able to use.,5
B07543D21Q,They are a lot thicker and therefore more support then the ones used after surgery.,5
B07543D21Q,Since most of my pants are black I ordered the three-pack of black compression socks.  They are very cimfortable so I ordered more in different colors.,4
B07543D21Q,"These were good quality socks.  The ribbing was not so thick that it irritated your legs after wearing for many hours.  I wouldn't say the compression was a very strong compression, but for weekend running around and daily wear, it did help.  They were also nice and warm for winter.",5
B07543D21Q,My wife says they work well and fit nicely.,5
B07543D21Q,Needed these for a fractured foot to reduce swelling. Ordered and came same day. My only comment is that I could use a small but only comes s/m but they are easier to get on and off.Love the color choices. and the price. They do control the swelling and seem like durable socks.,5
B07543D21Q,"Very comfortable, but I am short and have to fold them over. I am afraid that they cut circulation just below the knee.",5
B07543D21Q,Comfortable true to size. Really helps my aching feet after my 16 hour shifts,5
B07543D21Q,Nice lightweight compression. Love the cat one .,5

B07543D21Q,Nothing more to say. Read headline,5
B0BC3F17K8,I've been wearing them for about two weeks and very happy with them.  Seem to have just the right amount of compression.  No more swelling in my ankles. And they're very comfortable.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"I was looking for an athletic sock that was knee-high (for winter) with a padded bottom for walking and running.  I thought that was what the description said but after receiving and re-reading it says ""thickened"".  I've purchased compression socks before that were too big in the toes and gaped, but these fit great and are easy to put on.  Other than the fact that they don't have a padded bottom, they are very comfortable socks.",4
B0BC3F17K8,Great fit for someone with muscular calves.  Can wear all day without excessive constriction and legs feel good even after being on feet all day,5
B0BC3F17K8,Great looking socks and great fit. Really helping with my swelling in my feet and ankles.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"The socks are not 20-30mmhg.  They are far too easy to put on.  20-30 mmhg compression socks are actually a pain to put on and take off.  These are more like a 10-20 sock.  I am 6ft and 200 lbs.  I got the XL socks.  The footbed fit fine for my size 12 foot, but the socks are too short.  They should be 1.5 inches longer for proper calf compression.  The ankle compression is probably ok.  But the foot has very little compression and the calf compression is just inadequate.",3
B0BC3F17K8,"I'm a recovering ""fat dad"" who has taken up running. My problem is my calves always killed my after 2 or 3 miles. I grabbed my compression wool hunting socks and they helped so I wanted to order some compression socks that would not only be lightweight, fit great but also be insanely colored to the point that they would embarrass the crap out of my teenage daughters!!!! These socks do all of that and more. My daughters' friends find it hilarious to see me running at the track at the local fitness center in my neon socks so it makes it even better!!! I love them because they are super comfortable and my calves don't ache when done. I'd love to be a product tester if this company ever needed to try out new patterns and colors!!!",5
B0BC3F17K8,Great colors and very happy with themWash up very nicelyColors stay strong after washingHave warned some colors 5 or 6 times just a nice as the first time and they stay in place hour after hour and I even wear them to bed sometimes works well for meYes Yes I would buy again,4
B0BC3F17K8,"Seems like a nice product but I would say it runs large. I wear a Men's size 10 shoe and ordered Large. The sock does not really provide much compression. I wish that I had ordered a Medium instead. If in doubt, order a smaller size.",4
B0BC3F17K8,"I do a lot of travel, so I needed compression socks, especially for long flights. These are perfect for air travel, and they are also a benefit when working out. I do long distance running and heavy toe presses when I'm working out my legs. Thanks to the hug, they aren't stretching too much out of shape while my calve muscles are getting larger.",5
B0BC3F17K8,Good compression socks really helps keep the swelling down.  Very well made and lasts for a good amount of time.  Price is also very good for 8 pairs. I am very pleased with the purchase.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"There are no instructions on washing and care of this product. As a medical professional, I am aware of the care, but the average person would not know that these need to be washed in cold water and line dryed, as a dryer will break down the elastic in the product.",4
B0BC3F17K8,"Had these for about a month now (winter) and they're great. I doubt I'd like them in the hotter months but so far, they're comfortable, they haven't stretched out, and they're warm.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"I'm diabetic and have occasional edema so compression socks are a life saver for me.  I've ordered a few different pairs on Amazon that didn't wear so well, so I was on the hunt for more.  The deal at the time for these attracted me to them (as well as the fact that they weren't all black).I am completely impressed with these.  They are very comfortable, and also feel like much better quality than others that I've had.  They seem very durable, and should hold up well to washing.  I will definitely be buying another set.",5
B0BC3F17K8,Bought these on recommendation from our PT. They were easy to put on with a sock assistant device and gave good even compression. They launder well.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Recently had a hip replacement, with lots of swelling along the leg. Decided to try these socks to see if they helped the discomfort, and they did.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"I cringed at the thought of compression socks. Then I found these. I've gotten many compliments on these socks! They are comfortable, helpful & stylish. Instead of being embarrassed, I was stylish.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"I chose this brand because of the Reviews. A shout out Thank you to those who purchased these socks, and this helped my decision to purchase them. My husband felt a difference and after the first wear (hours later) we both noticed that the swelling (ankle area) was diminished. They arrived very well packaged and the instructions on the box were easy and simple to follow. I hand wash these and let them air dry.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"Just gave a 4 star, going to see on durability.  Fits great and feels good!",4
B0BC3F17K8,"Fine quality product and a real good price, comfortable to wear!!",4
B0BC3F17K8,I don't usually give reviews. These are great. They are long enough for even a long legged person.,5
B0BC3F17K8,He is prescribed a med that causes feet swelling as a pesky side effect and compression does work.Now all sports and exercise programs are suggesting these as standard equipment.Since they no longer look ridiculous when wearing my husband is much more willing to wear them.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"My wife tells me the fenglaoda 8 Pairs Compression Socks are great for long term use, like for being on your feet for long stretches of time. Not necessary for a run around the block or hanging out at home after work. Moreover, she liked the fit and quality of the material. Once she gets home takes them off and tosses them in the wash (hang dry) after a long day of wearing them. The fenglaoda 8 Pairs Compression Socks are as described, she found they had worked better than the crew compression socks she tried previously. My wife works 12 or more hours a day, therefore the knee high compression socks just makes more sense than the compression Crew Socks which is why the 5 stars.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"Easy to clean, great fit. Good for winter months and hopefully summer too",5
B0BC3F17K8,Slip down a little - maybe that happens with all compression socks? This is my first time using. Would buy more!,4
B0BC3F17K8,I really like these socks very comfortable,5
B0BC3F17K8,Perfect fit and comfort with these socks,5
B0BC3F17K8,Good product,4
B0BC3F17K8,"The socks are a little more difficult to put on, but are comfortable. Also, they look good. I wish I knew if they actually work.",4
B0BC3F17K8,These compression socks are so comfortable and I really like the reinforced toe and heel.,5
B0BC3F17K8,I like everything,5
B0BC3F17K8,Loved the colors! These compression socks help as I as am on my feet long periods with my job. My feet do not feel tired or as tired as when I wear regular socks. Recently went to an amusement park and wore these. They significantly helped me to walk longer periods without my feet hurting.,5
B0BC3F17K8,Very nice. Fit really well and very stylish,5
B0BC3F17K8,very good,5
B0BC3F17K8,I needed new compression socks; I've had mine for many years and could tell they were worn out. I disliked wearing the ones I own because they're thick and made my feet hot. But these socks are very breathable. The compression feels decent. I haven't worn them to work yet but I feel like these socks will be great for being on my feet all day.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"I have ordered 5 different types of compression sock and 2 of those from this same seller.  These aren't quite what i needed.  I have had aching ankles shins and heels for months. I am over 40, active but a little on the heavier side, and i play basketball with 15-19 year old youth/young adults every night.  After wearing these compression socks things were better but not quite as good as i would like.  I still ache but not as much after the games with the youth/young adults.  The compression is firm but doesn't have you struggling to get the socks on.  They feel fantastic but don't quite have the support that I'm needing.  If your aches and pains are minor these will be life/game changers for you.  However, if you need allot of compression, these aren't quite it.  I have used ankle compression socks on top of them to make up for the lack but it makes your feet really hot and feels a little off when playing sports.",4
B0BC3F17K8,"I was in chronic pain all the time due to the compression stockings I was using before.  Not even 24 hours after switching I noticed a literal night vs day difference in these stockings.  They're comfortable, snug, keep my toes nice and toasty and I can actually walk again to work!  I'm adding these a future list and buy another box after new years.  These are a MUST HAVE if you have flat feet and neuropathy like I do.",5
B0BC3F17K8,Fits great and very reasonable priced,5
B0BC3F17K8,Comfortable,5
B0BC3F17K8,"The compression depends on the size. If you want tighter compression, buy a size smaller. These are great socks, but they are more like standard knee highs, so I had to buy a smaller size. These would be great for larger calves.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"These are incredibly comfortable and work as described. Even if you didn't need compression socks, these are great in winter adding a layer to cold legs. The XL size is perfect for 12-13.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"Compared to previous products, these are great. Easy to put on and take off and they feel great.",5
B0BC3F17K8,So far so good. I have been wearing these socks for over a month now and they fit and wear perfectly. They stay up below the knee. I would definitely recommend them.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Love the Colors, Works well and Fits, Circulation is great.",5
B0BC3F17K8,Nice,5
B0BC3F17K8,nice selection and fit well happy with buy,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Perfect for tall men, socks comes up to knee.",5
B0BC3F17K8,My wife had foot surgery 9 years and we both have swelling in our legs.  These fit well and there is a variety of colors.,5
B0BC3F17K8,THEY ALSO SEEM LIKE THEY WOULD ONLY BE GOOD FOR JUST THE WINTER. HAVEN'T SEEN HOW THEY ARE IN SUMMER.,4
B0BC3F17K8,"I bought these for work as I need socks that do not fall down but I also wanted socks that with compression. These have worked well so far, lost I think two pairs to holes but when you wear them every week for everything I wouldn't expect anything less tbh but would be nice if they held up a little longer",4
B0BC3F17K8,"So far I love these socks . My ankles been swelling since I stand all day at work . I have bought 3 different brands and usually they are thin like a stocking or something . These are medium thickness in foot and snuck at ankles and calves . They stay up all day and into the evening . Where most slide down .every other compression sock I have bought always slide down making them useless . The only reason I don't give 5 star is I only had them a week and not sure how they will hold up after a few washings . But I am washing in cold water on delicate cycle and hanging to dry just for good measures . My swelling seems to be less if ot completely gone . But like I said it's only been a week .some days work is more intense than others . So time will tell more but so far these are best , most comfortable , and appear to be of outstanding quality ! I will try to give update but honestly I'm not very good at remembering to do cool stuff like that . ..oh ! And 25$ or so for 5 or 6 pairs or whatever that came in package is pretty killer deal too I thought !",4
B0BC3F17K8,"Recently had Bypass surgery, my therapist  recommended 20-30 compression. These compression socks have good upper/calf compression, but are a bit weak in the ankle area. Overall for the price they are a good value. Would Buy again.",4
B0BC3F17K8,"I've ordered a lot of socks in the past with mild compression and none fit comfortably or go on with ease. These are honestly the best socks. A tip for swollen legs and feet - turn the socks inside out when you wear them. The ""inside"" is smooth and the ""outside"" doesn't have a lot of pattern threads. You're going to love these!!",5
B0BC3F17K8,"Tip: Following the Instructions on the package when putting these on helps a lot to get them stretched on your feet and legs properly.The compression around my ankles could be better, but I have long skinny feet. You can't expect them to fit every single foot the same, when all feet are built different. The fit on my legs is great, and the compression is perfect. They come up to my knees just fine and stay up really good. I usually adjust them one time after I've had them on for about 30 minutes or so, and they're great for the rest of the day. I usually wear them for about 12-14 hrs a day.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"These are very good quality at a great price.  I highly recommend, and will be purchasing more in the future.",5
B0BC3F17K8,"I thought I would have to pay a lot more for quality like this. The extra support feels Good,The fabric slides on my skin, making themEasy on and Off!",5
B0BC3F17K8,These work well without being too uncomfortable they do not make your legs itchy like some other socks,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Very nice, good quality I would buy again!",5
B0BC3F17K8,These sock do the job and aren't too tight. They are very durable.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"So I will be honest, I don't have anything to compare them to seeing this is my 1st compression sock worn. I sit a lot in my 12 hour work shift and started getting edema where my top of socks sat and the indents were deep!! So I saw these and though let's try them! They are comfortable to wear, I personally don't like the feel of the material but I'm fairly certain this will be the case with all compression socks, and they seem to be slightly too long (I'm 5'8"") as they go up to knee and when sitting are in the knee crease, I've started lowering them when putting on so don't go up all the way to knee but this is where I've noticed the top of sock is leaving an indent after my 12 hours at work, now it's not as deep of an indent as my normal socks left but it's still an indent type mark and makes me wonder, are these really helping with the water retention in my legs at work? I really don't know..I've worn them for 2 weeks straight now and the edema is still happening at work just doesn't appear as severe as prior to wearing these to work. I'll continue wearing them to work see if that indent mark continues, lessens or goes away and let ypu know!! I ordered a size small as you see in pictures I have thin calves and I wear a 7.5 shoe, so a small should be the right size!",4
B0BC3F17K8,"They are very supportive, good fit",4
B0BC3F17K8,I have had these socks for 8 months.  There is no shrinking or flabbiness after many washings. They are comfortable and slide on pretty easily. I bunch them up at the bottom and then pull onto my leg.,5
B0BC3F17K8,When I got these socks I was initially disappointed at the thickness. I was expecting them to be a lighter material and that they might be too heavy for the weather since I live in Florida. But they work great.,5
B0BC3F17K8,Doing good,4
B0BC3F17K8,Muy buen producto,4
B0BC3F17K8,"These socks feel a little thicker than my previous pairs, and seem to be quite durable. A good buy!",5
B0BC3F17K8,"Ordered khaki, received gold.  Great socks!",5
B0BC3F17K8,I really enjoy wearing these.  They are very high quality and look very nice.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Perfect in every way but color selection.It would be nice if they offered brown, grey, navy blue, dark green, black",5
B0BC3F17K8,These socks amazing. I love them. I'm buying more soon.,5
B0BC3F17K8,Put them on and instantly felt the support and comfort,5
B0BC3F17K8,They came fast,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Easy to put on, comfortable. Great buy",5
B0BC3F17K8,"While I like these socks, I have doubts about their compression capabilities. I have really come to like wearing compression socks anytime I am either doing anything athletic, or on days when I know I am going to have to spend more time than usual on my feet. I was hoping that these would give me the compression I have come to enjoy from other socks, but I have to say that in many ways these kind of fell short. First, the material has a bit more of a tendency to stretch than other socks. As a result, I experienced quite a bit more sag over the course of the day, and would have to occasionally hike them up to keep them where I want them. They would also shift some on the foot, and about once or twice a day I will have to take my shoes off, and shift them back to where they should be. On the plus side though, I like their thickness. They are especially nice when doing things outside when it is a bit cooler. They provide me with an extra bit of insulation to keep legs warm. That extra bit of warmth is also nice for keeping things feeling loose. Their thickness also makes them extra comfy for the footbeds...particularly when they are in the proper position and bunch free. So long story short, I do like these but they are really just nice tall socks. I will continue to wear them for limited applications, but these will not be my go-to socks for times when I really do want compression to help me through my game or day.",3
B0BC3F17K8,"They are compression stockings that work well, thank you!",5
B0BC3F17K8,They hold up great on my legs. Feels comfortable.,5
B0BC3F17K8,Comfortable to wear all day,5
B0BC3F17K8,"A visit to the dr. office resulted in me having to wear compression stockings.  I have always worn over the calf socks but was told they were not the same.  My feet would be swollen at night but normal in the morning.  I am 75.  So, depending on your health, you might need some help getting them on.  The things are hard to put on but, they are comfortable once they are on.  It is amazing.  The reason for the 4 stars is because they are hard to put on but, I guess any compression sock would be.",4
B0BC3F17K8,"I normally don't write reviews, but these socks are AWESOME to say the least. I am very sensitive about having tight socks or anything up my calves too far, but these are so incredibly comfortable that you don't even know you have them on, and they do exactly what they are supposed to do. I was somewhat depressed knowing that at my age I would probably have to wear these for a long time if not forever, and I couldn't be more relieved at how comfortable they are.",5
B0BC3F17K8,If you are looking for compression socks that feel comfortable these are it. My husband legs and feet swell up really bad. He has tried alot of compression socks and says these are his favorite. He can barely tell that they are on.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"Super love these socks, very thick and warm, Support is #1 when on feet on all day, the fit is perfect.  Great choice",5
B0BC3F17K8,Husband says they are really helping his legs. Pretty to get on.,5
B0BC3F17K8,"These socks are great. I got them after getting a recommendation to get compression socks. I was told online would be the best if you want something better that what the local medical supply store would sell. Great colors, they have lasted several months with out any issues. They are very comfortable. The nice thing they are easy to wash as well.",5
B0BC3F17K8,awesome socks,5
B0BC3F17K8,"I'm not the biggest fan of neon but no one sees them so, for the price they're well worth it. Comfortable, no rolling up and they work! Only downfall is inside of sock has strings exposed. I Have to wear a brace under sock (for added cushion on side of ankle) only an issue when straightening edges of brace.",4
B0BC3F17K8,"I LOVE THIS, VERY COMFORTABLE!!",5
B0BC3F17K8,Usefulness,5
B08GZL48D9,"I wasn't sure I would like boxer briefs being a jockey wearer all my life but after experiencing the quality of these shorts and the comfortable feel, I will be a boxer man the remainder of my life. I was not sure about the fit before ordering my first pack, so I went with one size larger than what was the top number for my waist. I am glad that I went with it as I really like the loose fit they provide. I have already ordered a 2nd pack and will soon be placing an order for a 3rd. These shorts are excellent quality and a great value.",5
B08GZL48D9,"I've gotten these in the past and they've lasted for years.  I just got another 6-pack of them and got the medium which says it goes with a 32-34 inch waist.  I'm probably about a 33 at the moment and I wish I'd gotten the Large size.  The Medium does fit but it is pretty snug.  I'm used to looser boxers.  Hopefully they won't shrink when they are washed and dried.  At around $3.50 per pair, this is a pretty good deal.",4
B08GZL48D9,"it is a pack of 6 boxers. Note that when I take it out of the bag, in the bathroom, the boxer can almost be kind of ""see through"", so they are pretty thin. Depending on the circumstances, such as you want them to be thin or if it is for summer days when you are wearing shorts, then maybe it is a good thing.Also note that there are some loose threads when you first take them out. So I will need to shake them a few times so that the threads don't get into the washing machine when I do a first wash, so that the threads won't get into the outlet area of the washing machine and cause issues and require a repair.",5
B08GZL48D9,"Perfect fit, other brands were too small or just uncomfortable. This one's great and fit similar to the tommy Hilfiger boxers. Outstanding deal for the price.",5
B08GZL48D9,Serve the purpose,4
B08GZL48D9,Very comfortable. Material soft. Husband loves the freedom.,5
B08GZL48D9,my original style I like them and they fit well,5
B08GZL48D9,Fits my son perfectly,5
B08GZL48D9,HiHope this helps I'm a 40 but bought the 42Fit well look good hope they last 4 eaNice colors I like Hanes so have to see how they doThank you,5
B08GZL48D9,"Nothing great, nothing bad. Average boxer",4
B08GZL48D9,Fit perfectly,5
B08GZL48D9,I have bought these a few times so far and they feel true to size and are comfortable with no shrinking. I purchased another pack a month ago and the threads are falling out. The old ones are still going strong,4
B08GZL48D9,Good buy - great price,5
B08GZL48D9,"While the product is fine, be sure to check the contents immediately after receiving. I ordered 2 packages of 5, but just recently discovered one package only had 4 instead of 5 shorts.",5
B08GZL48D9,These are the brand I buy at the store for a much higher price.  I'm getting chubbier and went up a size.  These seem much baggier than the smaller size I bought at the store.  I would buy again for the low price and ease of not searching through a messy shelf at the store.,5
B08GZL48D9,I would buy this product again,4
B08GZL48D9,Hubby says they are great.,5
B08GZL48D9,Very pleased with my order! Shipped on time too.,5
B08GZL48D9,nice,4
B08GZL48D9,Good quality workmanship,5
B08GZL48D9,good product colors ok but very comfortable,5
B08GZL48D9,for at least a year and they are still in perfect condition after many washings so I would say these are worth the money.,5
B08GZL48D9,As described.,5
B08GZL48D9,"Ordered them for someone else, but I'm sure they were great",5
B08GZL48D9,"No more of those restrictive tighty whiteys. These will set you free!  Light weight as they are supposed to be.  I ordered the white ones first and they were great, Had to order the color combo boxers and of course they are fantastic!  These boxers are just like the ones of old. I wash em on cold and air dry to make sure they don't shrink. they air dry fast.  Outstanding!",5
B08GZL48D9,Fit well,5
B08GZL48D9,What more can a guy ask of his underwear,5
B08GZL48D9,Like tag free comfortable fit and true to size.,4
B08GZL48D9,Looked nice.  Was for my son.  Haven't heard any complaints.,5
B08GZL48D9,Bought these for my husband. He likes them. Comfortable. True to size. Nice fabric.,5
B08GZL48D9,These wash well and do not shrink. Pleased with my purchase.,5
B08GZL48D9,Quality,5
B08GZL48D9,"Always wore tight bikini shorts. These will get some getting use to, things flopping around, lol. But I like them very conferrable...",4
B08GZL48D9,"I bought these on April 3rd 2022. I ordered another one shortly after because these were the first boxers I have ever own that didnt roll up my thigh. They are just starting to roll up a little bit now, but I change my boxers everyday and they are washed once a week. The elasticity in the band is strong, it still holds like it did when I first bought them. The boxers are so comfortable to wear. 10/10 for me",5
B08GZL48D9,Fit perfectly,5
B08GZL48D9,Purchased for someone as a gift after they evacuated from the Maui fire.,5
B08GZL48D9,"comfortable underwear and they look and fit as advertised, the sizing is very accurate",5
B08GZL48D9,Good value and great stocking stuffer!,5
B08GZL48D9,Really good quality boxers! I really like these light weight boxer shorts.,5
B08GZL48D9,Like that the legs are not tight fitted,5
B08GZL48D9,"good fit and ideal for hot Summer months, the fabric is holding up well to washes so far",4
B08GZL48D9,"I thank you for the package, nothing to complain about.",5
B08GZL48D9,"Soft, good fit, true to size.",5
B08GZL48D9,"This product does what is expected, but the fabric is a bit rough even after two laundry cycles. Also just a bit thin and prone to wadding.",3
B08GZL48D9,fit well comfortable,5
B08GZL48D9,Fit is on point.,5
B08GZL48D9,"Fits well and lasts a long time. Have purchased before. Does not shrink, and elasticity stayed constant for a few years.",5
B08GZL48D9,Great fit! The waistband is comfortable without being too loose.,5
B08GZL48D9,"No frills, good quality shorts, but fit a bit tight. I would order a size larger next time",4
B08GZL48D9,you should buy these,5
B08GZL48D9,I think these are really comfortable but my main concern is that it's really thin and the flap always seems to open up which is kind of annoying. I really wish they have the button in the front still.,4
B08GZL48D9,"Sizes seem to run a little  small  , I would buy next size up . Prices are great right now . Stores like Walmart the prices are higher and have had  a low inventory for the past six months . Why , not sure they are always in demand . These are made in Vietnam . I have always kept a good supply of them but with schools  starting up pretty soon I thought I better scope up a package for $ 19.95 for 6 pairs . I've always liked Fruit of the Loom over Hanes because they are thinner in material .",4
B08GZL48D9,I wear these under a housedress or as p.j.s .,4
B08GZL48D9,"Underpants are tre to size, they are comfortable and does not shrink when machine washed, the fabric does not have any holes easily and it looks great.",5
B08GZL48D9,Needed these,5
B08GZL48D9,Needed new one badlyGreat colors,5
B08GZL48D9,"These boxers are nice, colors are vibrant, but they're a little bit too thin (paper-thin, right on the edge of transparent, hehe), the fabric feels weird because of this.I have to admit that I also made a mistake and I ended up ordering them in a smaller size. I ended up giving these away, so I think I'll give them a 2nd shot. I'll re-order these in a month or two.",4
B08GZL48D9,Good fit and great for the money. Fits my size and looks nice. Comfortable to wear and doesn't shrink.,5
B08GZL48D9,"Nice quality, but doesn't close up well to keep your privates in and covered.",3
B08GZL48D9,"I open the bag and as soon as I felt the thin plastic like cloth material, I made up my mind I was going to return the under wear.  I decided to try them on and I was surprised how comfortable they felt.  I decided to keep them.  However, the material (cloth, polyester)  used needs improvement",4
B08GZL48D9,"These are not the comfiest, but they look the same as the picture and have held up in the wash so far",4
B08GZL48D9,"I have worn Fruit of the Loom boxers for for at least 10 years and originally chose them because they fit much better than other brands, especially Haynes. Some of the colors in this recent batch are a bit garish, but I can live with that.  I was somewhat distressed when I opened the package and saw the waistband was different.  Perhaps my skepticism is growing with age, but many changes may save the manufacturer money, but they are are rarely better for this consumer.  So I just washed and wore one package, expecting to send the other back.  However, the one problem with the old style band was that it was tightly knit and caused me to sweat in hot weather.  These new ones ...do not.  So, the second pack of drawers is in my bureau drawer.  Good job Fruit of the Loom.",5
B08GZL48D9,Well made for an import. Fit as described,4
B08GZL48D9,These are good boxers.,4
B08GZL48D9,My husband is happy with his purchase,5
B08GZL48D9,Not so good of a quality but will do the job,3
B08GZL48D9,Very comfortable,4
B08GZL48D9,"I found that these were not like they use to be. They shift and move. They hug and ride your balls! Uncomfortable to me, so I won't be ordering these again!",3
B08GZL48D9,"In the past, everything Fruit of the Loom made was nearly 100% cotton.  So I made the mistake of assuming these were too.  They are not; only 55% cotton.  To that end, they do feel like they are half polyester.  I purchased these to use to sleep at night and they are okay but not great.  Other than the poly feel, they are also fairly thin; thinner than I had hoped.  They also run a bit small in the waist, but not very.  For the price Fruit of the Loom is still a bargain.  But it seems the quality, like almost everything these days, has declined.",3
B08GZL48D9,these boxers fit well and came with a variety of colors,5
B08GZL48D9,"Lightweight, breezy, and unrestrictive, this 5-pack of boxer briefs manufactured by Fruit of the Loom in Vietnam is a relative bargain compared to other boxer brief multi-packs. Priced at less than $4.00 per pair, a shopper will probably be hard-pressed to find a better deal among major manufacturers of this sort of product. These boxers are very comfortable--so much so that at times I find myself sitting at this computer station wearing just the briefs and a t-shirt. (I'm allowed to do this now that I live alone.) I recommend this multi-pack of boxer briefs to anyone of any age who relishes comfort in their undergarments. I have one minor caveat, however: I have only worn these briefs for a couple of weeks so I don't know how long they will last before starting to show signs of wear and tear. One of the reasons they are so comfortable is because they are so lightweight. Any evidence of early deterioration will be addressed in an amended version of this review.",5
B08GZL48D9,Fit my husband perfect classy colors he will be purchasing more,5
B08GZL48D9,Give as a birthday gift,4
B08GZL48D9,"I wish they had these particular boxers with a button fly, as my junk is exposed when sitting.",4
B08GZL48D9,"These are what are considered ""full seat"", or ""drop seat"" boxer shorts... They're the ULTIMATE in comfort.They're made the way men's boxers were made 50 plus years ago... The waist rides on your natural waist, a bit higher than what's current.The ""full seat"" part means that there is a separate strip of material that's sewn in the seat, there are two vertical seams that run down from the waistband and end at the bottom of the leg openings... What this allows, is for the seat to ""lay flat"" when the wearer is sitting down... So there's no binding, no pinching, no tight feeling constriction.In fact, for those who've never worn this type of undergarment, you'll probably forget you're wearing underwear about ten minutes after you've put them on.The material is cotton. The waistband is pinch pleated cotton over elastic.If you're anything like me, these are a real welcome change from ""modern"" low rise shorts that seem to want to fall off every time you walk... They're the ultimate in all day comfort.",5
B08GZL48D9,fits a little tight in the butt area esp when u squat or sleep on your side but not a issue,3
B08GZL48D9,They fit well and have a variety of color. Gifted to a friend.,5
B08GZL48D9,"They do the job, but the fly is easier to open then I like.",4
B08GZL48D9,"Fruit of the Loom is a great quality item for the price paid.  It doesn't shrink, it stays tru to size.  For the first washing I used a liquid fabric softener.",5
B08GZL48D9,Perfect fit,5
B08GZL48D9,"I'm satisfied with these undies. Good fit, comfortable, reasonably priced (especially when discounted), without excessive sacrifices in fabric or quality. Respect your private parts and don't just go for the cheapest undies you can find!",4
B086KSDTQ4,"Good quality, especially for the price and quantity. Comfortable and typical sizing.",5
B086KSDTQ4,"My husband likes them , comfortable and breathable they go true size",4
B086KSDTQ4,"Good quality. Good price. arrived on time.  Couple pairs have what appears to be bleach stains or not fully dyed,,,, not sure but not sending back.  Good fit.  Maybe a whisker on the tight side - size large.",5
B086KSDTQ4,"Sizes are accurate, and Hanes have always been comfortable. Hard to beat good old fashioned cotton! Very satisfied with purchase.",5
B086KSDTQ4,"I have been using Haynes clothing for quite a while now and am generally satisfied with the quality of their products.I like the fact that this Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs feature moisture-wicking technology that helps keep you dry throughout the day. The ComfortSoft waistband is also noted for its softness, which prevents chafing, making it suitable for warm weather.The material used in these boxer briefs are primarily cotton, which is renowned for its softness and comfort. In terms of durability, they hold up well after regular washing and wearing.Overall, these Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are a cost-effective option for those seeking comfortable underwear.If you're looking for basic, everyday boxer briefs, Hanes could be a suitable choice.....So far I have had no regrets purchasing this product.",5
B086KSDTQ4,"Yea so I bought these a little less then a year ago size XL and they fit great, always have been comfortable. I am back to buy more not because they are worn out but because all of my other ones are, so I need some more. Good product",5
B086KSDTQ4,Good for the price but size was way off,4
B086KSDTQ4,"I recently did a complete underwear overhaul for my husband, and I bought him a bunch of these Hanes boxer briefs. He absolutely loves them!They're incredibly soft and comfortable, and he says they're much more breathable than his old underwear. Plus, the price is unbeatable.He was so happy with them that he actually threw out all his old underwear!If you're looking for comfortable and affordable men's underwear, I highly recommend giving Hanes a try.",5
B086KSDTQ4,"I needed to get more underwear because some of mine started developing holes, yes I wear them down pretty hard. I'm a heavier guy (~250 pounds) and the size I got fits well, but aren't too snug. Good value for the price!",5
B086KSDTQ4,My husband asked me to replace his Hanes briefs because the elastic wears out and gets stretchy the first few times you wear them. So I bought this product to try it out. They've been through the washer five or six times and they still look like brand new.,5
B086KSDTQ4,"Works for me, I think they are excellent and well worth the money spent.",5
B086KSDTQ4,Good value.,4
B086KSDTQ4,Have worn these for many years. Good price and true to size.,4
B086KSDTQ4,Cumplen su funcion,4
B086KSDTQ4,The elastic on these things somehow simultaneously keeps them on the wearer whilst being flexible enough to stretch when needed. No further context here is required.,5
B086KSDTQ4,"Bought for my husband, he says ""no complaints""! Good quality, have held up for months now.",5
B086KSDTQ4,These are a good value and they're comfortable. It's all good. I would buy again.,5
B086KSDTQ4,My bf said these are comfortable. But the ends get frilly easy,4
B086KSDTQ4,On time and as advertised,5
B086KSDTQ4,"My son loves these underwear. He said they are comfortable, and they stay in place. Very breathable.",5
B086KSDTQ4,Very comfortable excellent price,5
B086KSDTQ4,I wasn't sure if I'd like them but I actually do like them.  They ARE Comfortable!,5
B086KSDTQ4,Fit and price is definitely a plus.  Fit is true to size,5
B086KSDTQ4,"They lose elasticity around the bottom within a few hours, and I was looking for something that would maintain elasticity there for longer periods of time. I have not been able to find something like that for many years now from this company, which is disappointment. Still, they are comfortable otherwise and get the job done.",4
B086KSDTQ4,"My husband and son both prefer this brand.  They are good quality comfortable, correct size and easy to use.",5
B086KSDTQ4,Very comfortable,5
B086KSDTQ4,Quality,5
B086KSDTQ4,Bought these for my hubby and he loves them. They are very comfortable and fits well.,5
B086KSDTQ4,"They weren't all crappy like the Hanes you get at Walmart, where the quality is cut so it's a cheap sale. But the Hanes at Walmart gray, stretch, shrink, they are crap. The Hanes from Amazon are still great a year later. Comfortable, not faded, cotton for comfort and the size was great. I buy them from Amazon when I need underwear.",5
B086KSDTQ4,Fix perfectly,5
B086KSDTQ4,Fit well. I hope they last quite some time,5
B086KSDTQ4,"First time for boxers, and very pleased with the quality, feel and designs. Will order again. My husband is hard to please and likes them. Bye, bye to briefs!",5
B086KSDTQ4,Exelente calidad,5

B0DFPL6SKG,"I absolutely loved this shirt! The COOFANDY Men's Linen Short Sleeve Casual Shirt is the perfect choice for beach weddings and a variety of everyday occasions. Its lightweight and breathable fabric keeps you comfortable even in warm weather. Made from high-quality linen, this shirt not only looks fresh and stylish but also resists wrinkles, making it an excellent option for travel or long days out. The casual fit allows for easy movement, while the short sleeves offer a relaxed vibe that is perfect for summer outings. Overall, it's a versatile addition to any wardrobe! In fact, I got it in different colors.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Wearing a light colored shirt out to dinner while on vacation is a bit risky. Is there a good chance I manage to not get wine or food or dessert on it? Yes. Is there a good chance I get one or possibly all three on it? Also yes. So it's important to look good without being too pricey and ideally with the ability to withstand how I am. This shirt hits all of those points.Now, this is not a fully linen shirt, it's a linen blend that has the appearance of linen. For me, this is perfect because it means most things will wash out if they don't set, it's got a little bit of flex to it, and it doesn't wrinkle quite as easily or severely as linen. The fit is an athletic cut, which is what I was looking for. I'm 5' 10"" 192 lbs, medium frame, but bigger in the shoulders, 33 waist and the Medium was perfect. If you're a larger frame, go larger because the arms were a bit tight.I have it in white and blue. They were purchased for vacation/beach wear, but I think they may join the spring/supper rotation next year. Definitely a great value for what you get. I've purchased other items in the past from this brand and I've yet to be disappointed. The ""linen"" pants that match these shirts are also highly recommended for all of the same reasons, if you need to complete the look.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"I seldom purchase clothes online due to numerous past disappointments. However, I decided to give this shirt a try, and to my surprise, it's a great fit, comfortable, and I believe it looks good on me. Encouraged by this, I ordered three more in different colors. I chose size XX Large, and they fit perfectly. As someone who usually wears t-shirts and jeans, I appreciate the shirt's simple design and solid color. The fabric is lightweight, which is ideal for Florida's summer heat. After about eight washes, I'm writing this review, and I'm pleased to report that the shirts have neither lost any buttons nor have any loose threads, which speaks well for their quality and consistency, especially since all four shirts have held up well in the wash and dryer without any problems.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"I love the way this shirt looks with the hidden buttons and texture of material on my husband; however, the first wash and dry caused a thread to pull. Too soon!!",3
B0DFPL6SKG,"I was worried about the fit for my husband but they fit perfectly. Air dry the shirts, they were pretty good about wrinkling, you just have to fix the cuff on the sleeve before hanging to dry.",4
B0DFPL6SKG,Love it,4
B0DFPL6SKG,My husband bought this for a stay at a resort. It was his beach shirt that also doubled as an outing shirt. He loved wearing it and it kept him cool and comfortable.,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Was what I expected,4
B0DFPL6SKG,"Husband/ loves the fit, very comfy nice to wear on an evening out",4
B0DFPL6SKG,Nice casual comfortable shirt. Arrived just as expected. No worries.,4
B0DFPL6SKG,"Todavia no las use, pero con seguridad seran unas de la prendas preferidas",4
B0DFPL6SKG,A lot of loose buttons,4
B0DFPL6SKG,Bought this for vacation in the D.R.. Super comfy shirt. Size is spot on. Plan on buying two.or three more for our trip.,5
B0DFPL6SKG,These shirts are amazing. Purchasing for a trip to Egypt in April and will be comfortable and fabric that will breath will make the visit enjoyable.,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Comfortable shirt, fit was perfect.  The way it was shipped----in clear package with shipping label slapped on plastic.  Not happy with the way it was shipped",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Vibrant colors, soft and comfortable, true to size.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,quality is great.  runs large.,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Shirt fits well and is very comfortable. I will order a few more.,4
B0DFPL6SKG,Needed a nice purple shirt for a wedding to wear under a suit coat this one fit the Bill and it was very comfortable to wear,4
B0DFPL6SKG,Feels like quality material and fits correctly. Haven't washed it yet but it is stylish and looks great.,4
B0DFPL6SKG,this was a 2 shirt order...1 came from vietnam and was wrapped nicely and fit perfectly.....this one..strangely did not come from vietnam..it came from china...it was terribly creased out of the package and took my wife 15 minutes to carefully iron it....so...not happy with the new condition of this shirt...,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"I would add one star if Ihad received a new, unused shirt.  I've ordered a total of 4.  The first was new, but was a full size larger than I woud expect based on usual sizing.  I returned it and got a replacement, one size smaller that was satisfactory.  I liked it enough to order two more.One of the two (in the same order) was fine, came packed with a cardboard backer, tags and was enclosed in a branded plastic bag.  The other was bunched into a small unbranded plastic bag, unfolded and heavily wrinkled. It was also missing one button on the front.  Obviously a return that was sold as new.",3
B0DFPL6SKG,"I haven't yet washed the shirt, but first try-on looks very good.  Waiting for Summer :)",5
B0DFPL6SKG,great,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Ordered in my size to tight  but good shirt,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Me gusta esa camisa,5

B0DFPL6SKG,i'm a wide chested fellow and the xl fits nice,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Look and quality looking for a special event,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Great Linen shirt no button show, very clean cut. It was a gift for my son and he has raved about it.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"I'm quite happy with this shirt (and ordered two more) but have a couple of issues to report:1. The shirt started out in the factory neatly folded but packing and shipping came full of creases that needed touch up with a hot iron to go away. After the touch up, now a wash in cool water, a few minutes in the dryer and hanging up to finish drying is all that is needed. So I'm happy ...2. Three of the buttons have come off in the last week and had to be sewn back on. Not so happy about this. I'm hoping my two other shirts, that have arrived, don't have the same problem.",4
B0DFPL6SKG,"Shirt is really nice but the small is bigger than what a small usually is. My husband always wears smalls, but it fit him like a medium!",4
B0DFPL6SKG,Great looking shirt quality is superb  fits as expected,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Described as pictured... Very nice quality and feels comfortable.  IMO. well worth the price.,5

B0DFPL6SKG,Product was as described digitally,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Beautiful shirt!  Good fit.,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Nice shirt, but it could use a pocket.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,Came quickly. Fits well . Good material,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"The material and design are very attract. If you go with a ""standard"" size chart, as opposed to the one shown here ,you should be okay. I'm usually on the border of L and XL and the L fit okay. The cuffs look great in the ad. However, with the first wash, the crease came out a bit limp and uneven. The description does classify them as adjustable, but I don't they'll hold outside of the original crease. On the other hand, after one wash, some of the creases created by folding for packing/shipment remain to some extent. All in all, it's a good shirt for the price.",3
B0DFPL6SKG,Shirt fit perfect,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Love the color and the fabric is nice enough - ordered a xxl but its still a bit too tight in the girth...need to lose weight.,4
B0DFPL6SKG,"Only problem I had was the top bottom loop was sewed shut. Other that that nice shirt, nice fit. Happy with the purchase.",5

B0DFPL6SKG,Perfect fit and nice quality fabric,4
B0DFPL6SKG,"I bought this for my husband. The size, and color is outstanding. I will definitely order again from this seller.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"This shirt looks very nice. The fabric is not stretchy, but if it's good.My husband is 5.11 and weights 175 and normally wears a size medium, so we bought a medium and it fit perfect .",5

B0DFPL6SKG,Hermosa camisa y de buena calidad,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Fits well and looks good on him,4
B0DFPL6SKG,"This shirt is perfect for that dressy casual look where you want to wear it on the outside of your pants, so it's not too long.",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"I really liked this shirt but I returned it because it was a little tight across the shoulders and belly. It looked good, it wasn't visibly too tight but it just felt a little restricting and I was going for the ease and mobility. I am 5'11 and 230 lbs.",4
B0DFPL6SKG,Just loved the fit and feel of the material,5
B0DFPL6SKG,Bought for a Mexico vacation. My husband usually wears XL shirts. This was very boxy and unflattering. I returned.,3
B0DFPL6SKG,"Slim fit, great quality, lightweight and comfortable - definitely worth getting",5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Love this shirt, feels nice when on and looks great with jeans or pants light weight too",5
B0DFPL6SKG,It's a good fit; it washes well and I hope to have it for a long time. The only negative for me is that the 'invisible' buttons take me longer to put on and take off.,4
B0DFPL6SKG,Looks great on him,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"Looks great,feels great,too small. Size Guide say's 44 in chest.No ,41 in maybe.Will return and get next size up.",4
B0DFPL6SKG,"While it is a good-looking shirt, the rayon content can make it very hot for a summer day. It is wrinkle resistant, which linen is very much not. We like the look of wrinkled linen, rather than the artificiality of this blend. Much like the ""Bamboo"" fabrics, this shirt is just another rayon product, only with a bit of linen to lure you into buying it!",4
B0DFPL6SKG,"theses are nice shirts, amazon recommend large, they fit perfect for now, but one wash would have been too small, returned it. xl would have fit perfect.",4
B0DFPL6SKG,Good fabric and the shirt is a nice color is well made. I got a few nice compliments from women about it and what more can you ask from a shirt?,5
B0DFPL6SKG,"My boyfriend loves this shirt. Such a cute color. I ordered a Large, the material is not thick but not too thin breathable for Florida weather. Lol",5
B0DFPL6SKG,It is a nice shirt but it fits more loose in the waist than the pictures and it is also longer.Note also that despite the title of the item it contains only 30% linen (as stated in the descrption),3
B0DFPL6SKG,"Great shirt, I bought one Coofandy shirt, it was so comfortable and looks great, versatile, I liked it so much that I bought several more in different colors. Good quality and fair prices. And they look great especially the price.",4
B09FCBZ4YK,"Great fit, comfortable, look good and durable, good value for the money. Band and legs stay in place.",5
B09FCBZ4YK,Great product.  Fits well and flexible.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,These underwear are very comfortable to wear and fit is great.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,"These are pretty decent briefs, but the fabric was thinner or more ""sheer"" than I was expecting. The waist band is also quite thin. They are comfortable, though. I'm not sure if the sheerness is by design or a cost-cutting measure, and I suppose it would be a nice feature in hot climates. Compared to other briefs I have had with a more substantial feel, these lose 1 star.",4
B09FCBZ4YK,These boxers feels amazing. Does not irritate or roll up while feeling supportive and durable. Great value.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,These fit amazingly. They are very good quality. The material is so good. They are thick but still breathable.,5

B09FCBZ4YK,They fit well. Very comfortable overall,5
B09FCBZ4YK,These fit great. One had a small hole in them that did not affect function.,4
B09FCBZ4YK,I LIKED THE PRODUCT. I WEAR THEM AS UNDERWEAR,5
B09FCBZ4YK,They fit well and the band is not too tight.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,My son absolutely loves these. He made it a point to tell me how much he could move better in them. The durability and thickness is great. Highly recommend,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Enjoy these. Not to tight. Not too loose.  Comfortable.  Recommended,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Solid quality I'll see how it goes in 6 months,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Got multiple packs for son whose clothes get washed at a base by people who process lots of uniforms and linens. They are serving its purpose under athletic wear and uniforms. So far its been six months of harsh use and wash and told they are all holding up well under these circumstances,5
B09FCBZ4YK,"Love these underwear. Most comfortable ones I've ever worn. I only give four stars because they shrink so much I needed to return my originally purchased XL, (size I've worn for 40years), and exchange for 2XL. There was no issue returning them. I just want people to know that they will shrink excessively when run through the dryer with the rest of your laundry. I just purchased another pack.",4
B09FCBZ4YK,Everything is perfect,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Comfortable and long lasting and the price was great,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Great fitWould like better for $1 less per pair,4
B09FCBZ4YK,Personal use,5
B09FCBZ4YK,They are great. After a few washes I noticed the brand elastic band was bunching up so I have to smooth them out. Love the material they are made of and fit true to size,4
B09FCBZ4YK,"Gave them to my teen son, my husband didn't like the band.",3
B09FCBZ4YK,Made to last and look great.  Very comfortable,5
B09FCBZ4YK,These are a very comfortable I'm glad I bought them they fit very well,4
B09FCBZ4YK,"Great product, perfect fit and a nice thick waistband. Highly recommend",5
B09FCBZ4YK,Haines has always been a good product the material on these boxer briefs are thin but heavy duty they're made from cotton and they support a man where he needs support. It definitely soaks up any moisture they're great functioning briefs you're able to move easily in them as they support you all day long comfortably!,5
B09FCBZ4YK,I like the wide waistband and the stretchy fabric with these shorts. And I know that with the name Hanes that it will last a long time,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Exactly what I expected. Great price. Perfect fit.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,not as described and fit funny,3
B09FCBZ4YK,I have bought from this company at least 2 times. My son loves these and he says they are very comfortable. When he needs more he comes to me with underwear in hand and says mom I need more of this kind of underwear. They fit well to the size I ordered. Guess who is getting new underwear for Christmas? LOL! I will continue to buy from this company.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Made of quality stuff,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Very nice and good fit.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Husband loves this underwear... very comfortable and durable,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Fills good,5
B09FCBZ4YK,I really like these but must say they shrink. I'd suggest ordering one size up. Otherwise they are very nice.,4
B09FCBZ4YK,These are nice.  Fit is true to size.  Loving the color combo waistband.  Legs lose its snugness after a long work day but that's not a deal breaker.,4
B09FCBZ4YK,Definitely worth replacing all the boxers in your drawer with these.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,The briefs are very comfortable and give a nice secure feel.  6 pack gives a great value to this purchase. Would buy again!!,5
B09FCBZ4YK,I love the stretchy yet comfortable fabric much more so than the 100% cotton briefs. The feel and fit is much better. I recommend them and will buy again. They might cost a few bucks more than 100% cotton but you will be glad you upgraded for the small price difference.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Son de muy buena calidad ..,5
B09FCBZ4YK,Needed New Undergarments,5
B09FCBZ4YK,"My husband loved them. Definitely thick, so if your man gets hot, maybe not a good idea. Nice for the colder months though.",5
B09FCBZ4YK,Great fit and fabric feels comfortable.,5
B09FCBZ4YK,"Not real impressed, half and half.....",3
B09FCBZ4YK,I like that they do not pinch.,4
B09FCBZ4YK,"The one thing men buy underwear for us to keep their um, organ inside them. Well these don't do that if your organ is big. The pocket is just a way for your organ to fall out. Fail design.Every 5 minutes I had to reach into my pants to put my organ back in. If you have a large organ don't get these. Your penis will fall out of the front pocket so much it will look like you're playing the organ. And that's not good for business environments.Not to mention that you sweat a lot down there in them! Compared to normal cotton. I learned the hard way, don't wear these when you exercise either. It's worse! My organ was bouncing around like a hot dog in a hallway, between hanging out the pocket and my shorts.If I could give 0 stars, I would. Because this underwear doesn't do it's job of keeping your organ inside them.Rethink this design Hanes. That pocket is too easy for your organ to bounce out of. VERY DISAPPOINTED.Ill go back to my trusty ol 100% cotton boxer briefs. They keep my organ in all day.I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. Sorry Hanes. This one is a flop!",5
B07PH2VWX1,I bought this set of underwears for my husband. He loves them and it is very comfortable for him ..I washed one of them ( the blue one on the top) you can see that srank just a little bit  from the red one. Still fits him really good..great price and great product. Highly recommend..it is breathable and fabric don't make him itch.,5
B07PH2VWX1,"Removed from packaging same day they arrived. Washed a couple of days later. All our clothes are washed in cold water, dried in a low heat dryer. Shrank at least a size. Do not hold their shape. Tried wearing 1 pair, couldn't get through a day of wear.",1
B07PH2VWX1,"For the record, I am reviewing: Fruit of the Loom Men's Coolzone Boxer Briefs, Moisture Wicking & Breathable, Assorted Color MultipacksWe have tried so many different underwear, just to throw them away. These we like. The size is good, material is good, waist band is good, pouch is good, and they are holding up well. They have not faded, the waist band has not lost any strength, and they seem to work perfect. I am giving them a five stars because they fit and feel good wearing, and they look good too.",5
B07PH2VWX1,"Some of the most comfortable boxers I've worn. Good length, comfortable and there's 7 to last for the week. I'll be buying again soon.",4
B07PH2VWX1,Good fit in the am but a bit lacking by afternoon.  Will tend too bunch up in the tender bits region.  Leg opening kind of stretch out allowing for ride up.  But they feel good in the morning.,3
B07PH2VWX1,These boxer briefs are accurately sized and they fit fine. The colors are nice also.The material is soft and the waist elastic is good.When I wear them the leg portion always loosens up and then when I wash them the leg portion is tight again. I am used to this with boxer briefs I have purchased before = normal.Time will tell how they last.,4
B07PH2VWX1,Men please go a size up,2
B07PH2VWX1,"I refuse to buy $50 for drawers that have cartoon bears, beavers, and a lumberjack for for advertising. If a bear makes it to my underwear, how tough they are is the last of my worries.  I went back and forth between Fruit of the Loom and Hanes until FTL came out with these cool zone boxers. I buy nothing else. They feel great, don't ride up, and my XL's fit perfect every time. Durable without being bulky and the cotton keeps me cool all day working as a machinist.",5
B07PH2VWX1,These are very good and reasonably priced. Fit good and always comfortable. Will buy again.,5
B07PH2VWX1,Great quality and very comfortable,5
B07PH2VWX1,"He liked the fit. His others were spandex mix I think  and were more comfortable. But, for your money, these are a great buy.",4
B07PH2VWX1,"Husband says fit ok. Has a ""bubble butt"" and these are not ment to accommodate that. They sit lower than would like",5
B07PH2VWX1,I'm pleased with these boxer briefs and like their fit and comfort.  The cotton material is thick and absorbent and the colors are outstanding.  They launder well and look to last a long time.,5
B07PH2VWX1,"It's good underwear. I mainly got them because they are 100% cotton, and that is what I want. I hate when underwear uses any kind of synthetic material as it's not good for the gonads and can affect your hormones. 4 stars since I haven't had them long enough to say that they have good durability. They are comfortable btw",4
B07PH2VWX1,I prefer these over any other companies underwear.  I tried most of them. Excellent quality.,4
B07PH2VWX1,They're great I bought for my boyfriend and they were great for him!,5
B07PH2VWX1,"Worried for how many I'm getting for the price, it was gonna be bad, but I love them so far.",5
B07PH2VWX1,Perfect! And thanks for the gift! Received 2 pairs of RDX shorts. Much appreciated!,5
B07PH2VWX1,This was an excellent purchase- fits true to size,5
B07PH2VWX1,FOTL!! What more needs to be said. The king of boxers and a good deal.,4
B07PH2VWX1,"Height 1.70Weight 67Ordered L and fits well, even has room for shrinking if it may happen.",5
B07PH2VWX1,Thank God I'm can now wear the correct size. Ove dropped from 3xl to a medium.  Great fit and the fabric is smooth and lightweight,5
B07PH2VWX1,La talla da a muy grande.,4
B07PH2VWX1,"If boxer briefs are your thing, these are as good as I've found.  They hold up and are comfortable.  I've been wearing these for over a year with no sign of wearing out.  The band doesn't stretch, and the legs haven't begun to fray.",5
B07PH2VWX1,Good quality and great price,5
B07PH2VWX1,Love it,4
B07PH2VWX1,Good quality product,5
B07PH2VWX1,"Good fit and I like the length for a boxer brief.  They are good quality and have lasted a good amount of time even with daily 3 mile walks, yardwork, etc.  Will purchase again.",5

B07PH2VWX1,I like the fit and feel to these. The only brand I'll get.,5
B07PH2VWX1,Great quality and fits comfortably,5
B07PH2VWX1,I definitely think they are worth the money.  They are well made and hold up well.  I should get plenty of wear with them.,5

B07PH2VWX1,"My bf is larger than most, so i had to look up specific types of bottoms if you feel me. These were the first thing to pop up, and he LOVES them. He actually threw away most of his other pairs bc of how good these are, and how they make him feel.",5
B07PH2VWX1,My husband is particularly picky and these are the closest I could get to what he likes.,4
B07PH2VWX1,"Good underwear. Cotton for comfort, the elastic has retained its stretchy Ed's, and it's quality fabric. Not thin stuff that develops embarrassing holes.",4
B07PH2VWX1,"The only thing is the material stretches when using, the leg of the pants expand.. when it is being worn.. not a fan of that.",4
B07PH2VWX1,Excellent product,5
B07PH2VWX1,My son said they are so comfortable and a great fit,5
B07PH2VWX1,"This item is exactly as it stated concerning color, material and fit.",5
B07PH2VWX1,"They are very supportive.  However, they run a bit small small.  I suggest buying a size up from what you normally get.",4
B07PH2VWX1,Keeping with the tried and true.  Nice and comfy,5
B07PH2VWX1,What can be said other than it was exactly as described and the men are happy with the fit and material.,5

B07PH2VWX1,I bought these after being really disappointed with Hanes branded ones I got form JCPenney. The Hanes now have suuuuper thin fabric that will not last at all. I'm pretty happy with these. They have a stronger fabric and a comfortable waistband.,5
B07PH2VWX1,Soft material and well made. I've used this exact brand and style for a few years now.  They are worth the price and are pretty rugged.,5

B09H7DP2Z8,"I like the grey camo, but I may by the green camo, as well.Comfortable.  Not overly warm, which is good!  Sizing is spot on.No tapered leg, which is what I am looking for.  The cuff on the leg opening is not my style, and I'm sure I am not alone.Does any company in the US make comparable, reasonably-priced pants?!?",4
B09H7DP2Z8,"These don't make you overheat, they're comfortable and well made. This was my 3rd order and each time I choose several colors. My son has sensativity problems with cetain fabrics and fits, he really likes these pants. They're slightly loose but still figure forming. No inappropriate tightness in the groin area. Nice deep pockets.Wish they made womens version.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,This is a great pair of casual pants. Nice solid material and fit was also good. There pants are super comfy and flexible. The zippered pockets are a nice touch as well. Will buy again in another color.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,The material is just what I wanted for this summer! Very lightweight and soft.The color is perfect because I wanted a dark blue and it is . They fit me and were so nice on me that my wife told me to order another pair of the lighter blue. They were priced very respectable and I love the zipper pockets which will keep my phone and wallet safe.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,I love these pants. bought a many of them for myself and family. They don't look like sweat pants and you can't tell that they are mens pants. So women don't be afraid to buy and wear these because they will pass of has dress pants. they wash well wrinkle free get anything on them especially dog hair wipes right off. I wear them year round just remember to wear long johns during the colder months. these a far better then leggings. They are soft to the touch which is very nice especially when you are getting romantic with your partner. They look good on any size person and they are very comfortable. I work in a distribution center and have plenty of room and stretch and don't easily get damaged like my other clothes. Highly reccomedand for all and yes they are true to size. you will not be disappointed. They now have more colors available since I first bought them. also the shorts are awesome as well.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"I use mine for running on the treadmill and out doing errands.  Love the zippered pockets to secure phone, wallet and keys.  Material is light weight, super comfortable and true to size.Great product for the money.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Love this ended up buying 3 more !! Im 6' 200 lbs with a 30 inch inseam and these fit like they were made for me. The quality is really nice awesome zippers and pockets just right !! some one really new what they were doing when they made these. I machine wash them and though it says you can dry them, I don't want to risk it, i hang them up and they are dry in 3 or 4 hours. I would give them more stars if i could ...  Truly awesome pants !!",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"I ordered these for my hubby and he loves them. They are a nice lightweight stretchy material, perfect for sitting around the home office but attractive enough to wear out. This material is quite different from what I would usually call a sweatpant. I wanted these to fit, so I used the size chart for this pant. He usually wears a size XL, but I ordered the 2XL and I'm glad I did. I actually measured his waist, well not really his actual waist, but where he wears his pants under his belly and paid attention to the sizing chart. His usual size would have been too small.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"I purchased these pants for my husband for Christmas.  Very well made, light weight and fit great.  Bought the small for my husband who is 5' 5"" and 143 lbs.  Fit perfectly and he loved them which is a hard to do!",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"These pants are very comfortable.  Great fit, length is perfect and the zippered pockets are a great feature.  Stretch fabric makes these a great everyday item.  I use them for the gym and even pajama pants!  Highly recommended",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"These are very nice athletic pants for lounging around the house, running errands, jogging, or walking the dog.They are not made out of sweatshirt material, they are much, much nicer.I ordered a couple pairs of them for my husband and he loves them.Machine wash in cold water, on gentle cycle, and hang to air dry.I ordered an XL as her has a 38/40 waist size.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Size and Fit are exact and they are extremely comfortable.  Will purchase another pair soon.  Actually nicer than more expensive name brand like Under Armour which is my usual go to brand.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,I bought this white pair right after I received my black pair because they are so incredibly comfortable!  I wear them all the time!  They look good enough to wear out on the town and feel good enough to just lounge around the house.  But these...they are the best!!!,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Purchased for my husband and he loves them! Material is very very nice quality, not too thick. We live in the south and do not need thick joggers. These are perfect for our winters.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"The size was smaller than expected, (had to return) however the material quality is excellent. Good value for money.",4
B09H7DP2Z8,I have these and a pair of Fabletics. These are less than half the price and I believe they are nicer. Extremely comfortable the length and sizes are accurate.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"5'10"" and 195lbs, Great purchase and quality. After several washes and gym workouts theseJoggers have surpassed my expectations. I recommend getting the XL unless you prefer a snug fit.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"I find the pockets way too small. Thankfully they have zippers. But I can barely get the zipper closed with my wallet in.  I will likely at some point either lose my wallet, keys, or phone. It's a shame, because I like everything else about them",4
B09H7DP2Z8,Bought these for my husband that coaches baseball. He loves the lightweight and pockets they have. The sizing is true to size!,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Bought a pair on Black Friday for my husband and he liked the fit, style & feel.  I was a little surprised since the pants actually have some style.  They are not heavy pants and are slightly tapered (not slim) in the legs. He liked them so much I bought a 2nd pair in a different color.  He wears them all the time. I will likely buy a 3rd pair if they go on sale again.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Bought these for my son, great quality fit well and will last him awhile. They feel like high end joggers.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Very comfortable and well made,4
B09H7DP2Z8,These are very lightweight and comfortable. Love how the pockets have zippers too. I ordered another one in a different color since I liked it so much.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Great.  Love this brand.  Quality material, great fit, true to size, very affordable.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Great fit and Great looking pants like the way  they feel!!!! Great price also!!!!,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"These Joggers have zipper front pockets and a zipper back pocket, so I can carry my phone, billfold, and keys while working out. They are ligyt, probably too light for winter, but I'm looking forward to wearing then next summer. Sizing was accurate. The only drawback is they could use zippers on the bottoms -- I have B-I-G feet.",4
B09H7DP2Z8,"These are terrific slacks that fit great and look good, but beware of the colors - they are not accurate. The slacks that looked like light tan are actually pink. I have two other pairs and they are terrific. Going to exchange these.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Fit as expected and great quality.  These are very comfortable.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"These are nice and work well before, during and after gym. Very comfortable and look sharp. Highly recommend.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Lightweight... plenty of room... hold up well in the wash... terrific for travel as they stay pretty much wrinkle free !,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Size runs slightly small. I am 35-36 waist, in between M and L. Medium was a little tight. Going to try L.Otherwise excellent fit and quality. Warm at 45-50 degrees.",4
B09H7DP2Z8,"light and great for hot summer days. Zippers oh yeah, must have ! Fits true to size",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Fit true to size, comfortable, I suffer from restless legs syndrome, so late in the day its hell to wear most anything. But these sweats work & wear awesome with this issueCONS:Zippered Pockets very swallow in my opinion.",4
B09H7DP2Z8,Great looking. Can pass as dress pants.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,I really love all the choices available,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Bought for son-in-law for Christmas. He said they were the best pants he's every worn. He is a big guy and has difficulty finding clothes that looks great and fits well.,4
B09H7DP2Z8,"I bought one pair of these initially to make sure I liked them, then went back and bought 2 more pair. They are light weight yet warm, and like the zipper pockets",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Looks great and feels great, keeps pocket items secure with well made zipper.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"The pants are very comfortable and with the drawstring, can be sized to your liking. One feature I didn't plan on. I have a dog that sheds, a lot. NO hair will stick to these pants, like nothing I have ever seen. I will be buying more.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Great quality!  Supper fast delivery!  Size chart is true to size.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"I bought these for my husband and two kids.  They dont shrink, color does not fade. they dont look like sweats. great material.  Boys love them!",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"The material is lightweight,ill use them in summer",4
B09H7DP2Z8,These pants are so comfortable and fit so well. I matched up with the size chart and they were a perfect fit.  The pockets can hold a decent sized cell phone and a thin wallet. Would recommend.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,18 year old son probably has all of the different colors of these joggers. They are his favs. Good material and value!,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Bought a second pair after how much I liked the first pair. I use for running among other things.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Not too tight not too loose, and very flexible material able to do leg day in gym without feeling restricted would but again.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Bought these for my husband and they look very flattering on. He is 240 lbs 6ft 1in athletic build.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"My actual measurements are 31"" waist and 29"" inseam.  I usually wear 32"" x 30"" pants.  I ordered a small and they fit great.  I workout and have thick upper thighs and these pants are not too tight.  The length is like a 30"" inseam pair of pants not a pair of joggers that stop at/above the ankle.  They are tapered so I like the length, even for riding a bike.Highly recommend at that price.  I got mine during a limited sale.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Love these. Have bought 6 pair (different colors). Love the zippered pockets. The pockets are deep as well. Highly recommend.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Not exactly Winter weather sweatpants, but more for lounging and activewear.  That's fine for me.  Zipper pockets and a good fit for athletic body types.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Fit well kook good,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Not big fan of zipper pockets! These sweatpants are feeling great (like not wearing anything). Easy to get them on and to wear for long time in the day. They are right on size but some might think they are very slim/skinny. Joggers should be like that.For cold weather, it is recommended to wear something under them. They are not very cold protective.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Good quality, nice sweatpants and definitely worth the money",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"I like the material, the cut, the style, and the size. The only thing I don't like is that my phone sticks out of the pocket (see pic), if the pocket was an inch or two deeper these pants would be perfect",4
B09H7DP2Z8,Nice sweats,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Very nice,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Excellent Product....,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"So far , these pants are very nice!.",4
B09H7DP2Z8,Comfortable,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Light weight and durable.  Great fabric that compliments the body shape,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"These sweat pants are very comfortable. They are very lightweight, flexible and I like the zippered pockets. I liked them so much, that I now have 4 pairs.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Great sport pants. Fit perfectly. Like the fabric weight and elasticity. Pockets are perfect for phone, keys and wallet! Very happy and will buy again in the future.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,You cannot go wrong with these pants! Love them they are good for all seasons. I was amazed how windproof these pants are. Again amazing for the value. You cannot go wrong! Buy the pants  when they go on sale for $25 bucks. Honestly they are worth the $40. Many choices of color for every occasion.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Bought this for my son. He loves the feel of the pants and these are his go to.  It has kept its quality in fabric and color.  He's 5'11 weight 175,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"As soon as I put on these pants, I knew I found something I would love. They're light weight, stretchy, and fit really well. I'm 5'10"" 165lb and I got a size medium. They're perfect.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Fit and comfort are great. Zip up pockets are  a plus because phones, wallets, keys, and everything else will fall out of my pockets when I sit with pants like these. Just trust me, order your size, or even plus 1 size, and you will be happy.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Bought these because I thought they were the same cuffed version that I had a couple pairs of already. I like them just as much!,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Soft and comfy. Thicker material, not the thin fabric.  Not wind proof but very comfortable",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Perfect for my PT classes.  Excellent elastic waist with a tie string as well,5
B09H7DP2Z8,I am a true medium but when I ordered the product was too baggy.  Thank you Amazon I returned and reordered in a small and they fit perfect.  You may want to order one size down for a perfect fit.  Excellent poroduct,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"Bought these to play pickleball. Very comfortable and they feel great.  Good movement, nice zipper side pockets. Nice looking sweatpants.Definitely buy again.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,I bought these pants for my husband in 3 different colors. I have washed them several times and they still look great.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,"The waist is higher than expected.  Covers my naval. However, folding the waist band over once actually brings band below naval and feels really good. I wear 30x30 pants and these fit well.  Very comfortable.  Light weight but not overly so.  Would buy again.",5
B09H7DP2Z8,Great quality  material awesome fit.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Excellent quality. I've tried dozens of different brands and this is one of the best. Very soft and breathable fabric. Color is vibrant and fit was good.,5
B09H7DP2Z8,They are extremely comfortable,5
B09H7DP2Z8,Very nice pants for gum or casual wear.,4
B09H7DP2Z8,"These are not sweat pants, they are thin material, and a bit stretchy, obviously some kind of synthetic fabric.  With that said, my husband liked them, liked the way they fit.  He can wear a traditional pair of sweats under them to keep warm, and it looks like he has on more ""regular"" pants.  He will feel more comfortable maybe in a public space with these rather than fleece sweats.",4
B07VWT4XRG,"Great socks! They are durable and been holding up in the wash well. The colors are just as pictured and they are a good thickness. They offer comfort and support on 12 hours shifts without suffocating my feet. These are a good value buy and I would recommend! I am usually a size 6 in pants and these are the perfect amount of compression for me, I wear them daily.Only issue is that when you wash the heel of the sock weirdly collects A LOT of hair (like from your head) and it gets weirdly tangled in the material so just be prepared for that if you're washing with other clothes. Im sure handwashing or washing separate would avoid this but its not a deal breaker for me I have still purchased another pack.",5
B07VWT4XRG,"The compression on these are fantastic - slightly difficult to get on (as it should be with good compression). Socks are all marked same size but are oddly different lengths.  There is a tiny hole where the fabric meets at the corner for the sole (as other people have commented), but the integrity of the socks hold strong, so that's really not an issue. Great value for the price - will buy more.",5
B07VWT4XRG,"These are my favorite support stockings, I have tried many others! They are easy to put on. These stockings are very comfortable and have just the right support. These are the stockings I will buy again!",5
B07VWT4XRG,"I never knew for 20 years that I needed to wear knee high compression socks at work until now. I am a healthcare professional who works on the floor. This was my new discovery that I feel lighter and supported just by wearing knee high compression socks! I wish I had known it sooner. They are not too tight, but just right. Highly recommend!",5
B07VWT4XRG,The socks are comfortable and doing a great job of compressing my legs. I do notice that my feet are less sore after a long day of standing when I wear them,5
B07VWT4XRG,"I've worn a lot of compression socks over the years from thick to thin.  Most of them cut me off at the ankle, giving me little compression in the needed spots.  These socks are thoughtfully designed to have the right compression in the right places.  I don't have the gouge marks where my ankles are like I used to.  Nor do I have grooves under my knees from them being too tight at the top. They are comfortable to wear but a bit thicker in the feet than I would like.  It's winter now, so the thickness is welcome, but I'm wondering how much my feet will sweat in the summer heat with these.  Other than that, it's a good choice.",5
B07VWT4XRG,"I originally bought these for my wife, who suffers from swollen ankles and legs, but they were too tight for her. So, on a whim, I tried one pair and wow, they felt so nice on my legs that I wore them for a whole day without any issues. When it was time to go to bed I had forgotten I had them on, they were that comfortable. Not only that, but my ankles didn't swell like they normally do on a busy day of standing up too much.I believe the secret is the amount of pressure the socks put on the legs: is high enough to keep the swelling down, but not excessive to the point that you want to just take them off the moment they hit your legs (as it has happened in the past with other similar products). The quality of the material is great and that's why I believe these will last me a long time. Thanks Amazon for carrying a quality product!",5
B07VWT4XRG,"Of all the compression socks that I have tried these gray style FITRELL Are the best of all..and they look good.My cardiologist was very impressed and said that I did not need prescription pair because these compression socks were excellent.  I did have a problem in sizing them right and I contacted FITRELL..  My calf was 7 1/2 inches around, and I fell right in between the Small/M and large/XL..  FITRELL  customer support was professional and contacted me within a few hours after sending them a message via Amazon..  For me, we figured out that the large/extra was my fit.Thank you,  FITRELL..  Rich K,  Plant City",5
B07VWT4XRG,Great compression socks! I've been through sooo many over the last 15 years. These have compression in the specific locations necessary but not through the entire sock.I would add that I would like to see a navy color as well as a darker gray/charcoal for wearing with different suits and slacks.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Wear most days.Been wearing these pretty much exclusively working long days doing construction since getting 3 months ago. One has a tear from me pulling up hard on it in a hurry one morning and there is some pilling on lower part of socks but not bad for being washed/dried and worn hard as I have.Only reason I will be not reordering is that now that I see the validity of compression socks I will invest in some Marino wool ones as I like to wear more natural fibers and these are essentially plastic.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"I needed a couple of pairs of these for post surgery recovery.  Began by  trying them on first.  They're well made and, although I mIght need help getting them on post-op,  the support is comfortable enough for all day wear.  They also fit well enough under a pair of light wool socks to get my regular shoes and boots on.",4
B07VWT4XRG,Have struggled to find good compression socks that fit up to my knee. I have several pairs of these socks and they fit very well. Compression is effective and they are long enough to fit over my swollen legs. I wash but don't put them in the dryer.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"I bought these on recommendation from my surgeon after ankle and heel surgery to help keep swelling under control. They are very strong, take some work to get on, and do a good job compressing my leg and foot. Recommend.",5
B07VWT4XRG,"I tried these compression socks yesterday.  At first then seemed to tight at the top, but that loosened up and I wore them all day.  They did their job.  I'm looking forward to wearing them on my fights this month since I'll be in the air for 24 hours.",5
B07VWT4XRG,"I weigh 150 lbs, shoe size 8, calf size 15. Got the x-large, and the calf portion of the sock was great - just enough compression.  However, if my foot had been a tad bigger I would not have been able to wear these.  Considering the price of these socks, they are well worth the money.  For those of you complaining that they are difficult to put on, ALL compression socks are difficult to put on.",4
B07VWT4XRG,Bought these for my brother who has been troubled with blood pooling in his feet. Since he has been wearing them the occurrence of swelling has become rare. The socks are very durable and long lasting.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"This set of 3 pairs of socks was just what I was looking for. They are not too tight, but provide nice compression. They are a nice weight. Highly recommend.",5
B07VWT4XRG,These socks are very very tight. You might be happier with ones that have a larger calf area,4
B07VWT4XRG,"I ordered these compression socks for 7 hour flight to Europe.  I have had two elective surgeries in the past year, and have worn them for my procedures.  I also put them on after playing pickleball for several hours, and wear  them while playing.  Makes a huge difference in my opinion.  Feels like a hug on my calves!!",5
B07VWT4XRG,"Come with 3 pairs. My circulation improved, is perfect not to tight. Comfortable . My swelling was gone the next day . Worth for your money",5
B07VWT4XRG,My doctor had me ordered the 15-20 compression socks and they felt too light. This feels about right for my need. I'll have to get another set. Hopefully they have other colors.,5
B07VWT4XRG,These are the comfiest and most supportive socks I've found on Amazon for a great price. I have CVI and need to wear compression socks all day. Other cheap brands weren't cutting it but these are similar to the pair I received from the cardiologist. Highly recommend for those who need them for everyday use.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"I'm 68 year old male with some typical edema and these were my first compression socks. I quickly ordered 2 more boxes and plan on wearing nothing else. They really make my bird legs feel better, especially now in the cold winter time.",5
B07VWT4XRG,These compression socks work but they're made of a cheap polyester and lint sticks to them like crazy even after washing them. They're also not very comfortable so I'll probably try to find comfier ones.,4
B07VWT4XRG,Fit comfortable. Helped ease leg cramps during a long flight,4
B07VWT4XRG,They work great would order them again.,4
B07VWT4XRG,"I have size-11 feet and sensitive toes, and these socks fit perfectly with no squashing!  I'll be buying more.",5
B07VWT4XRG,Good compression socks for the money!,4
B07VWT4XRG,Nice colors and fit as expected.,4
B07VWT4XRG,I had these for a year now and they are comfortable and works nicely. But each time I wash them it gets fuzzy and knotty.,4
B07VWT4XRG,"Had surgery and needed to stay in compressions for a few weeks. I was a little nervous about the S/M being too tight and both getting them over my calves, but they were perfect",5
B07VWT4XRG,Fairly easy to put on and works well.,4
B07VWT4XRG,This are the best compression socks that I have bought so far. Very comfortable; just went through a surgery and I slept with them,5
B07VWT4XRG,I wore these on an 8 hr airplane trip and they were great.  Felt so good and helped with the swelling of my legs and feet.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Fits very tight and rolls down,4
B07VWT4XRG,Though I love the compression which was better than expected. One pair of these socks already had some stitching coming undone after the first use. May return for a new pair. Would give 4.5 stars on fit and feel.Perhaps seller will send a replacement for one pair upon seeing this review!,4
B07VWT4XRG,Ideal amount of compression for moderate edema.  Very comfortable for all-day use.  Also look nice.,5
B07VWT4XRG,I used them on my long flights but now I use them when all day long while I work. I sit every day in front of my computer very long hrs and they help a lot,5
B07VWT4XRG,"Fits great based on sizing chart. Good amount of pressure, but comfortable enough to wear all day.",5
B07VWT4XRG,Once my husband got the hang of it he is able to pull up easy now. He said they make his legs feel good,5
B07VWT4XRG,"Soft,easy to put on and stay up while running",5
B07VWT4XRG,High quality compression socks. Wear them for hours playing pickleball. Helps with muscle stability and recovery.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"These did the job for which they were intended. Very tight, difficult to put on. I was putting them on someone else. I had to scrunch them up as much as possible to start with. He had very swollen legs from knee down",5
B07VWT4XRG,These compression socks are awesome! They stay up over the calf all day. They have not shrunk in the washer or dryer. Very Happy!!!,5
B07VWT4XRG,"very tight,",4
B07VWT4XRG,I bought these compression socks in XL and they were too long so I ordered them again in M and they fit great.,4
B07VWT4XRG,"I decided to try these because they were on sale and the price was too good to pass up, plus, they were highly rated. I've only had a day to try them but I'm very impressed with the quality- they seem to be a much more substantial material than other economy brands I've tried.",5
B07VWT4XRG,High quality.  Nice colors and right amount of density to hold up well.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Even compression across the foot and calf,5
B07VWT4XRG,"I work on my feet frequently but have plantar fasciitis, and my feet hurt and swell so bad after a day of work. I was skeptical about compression socks making a difference, and I'm pleased to say I was wrong. The swelling is almost nonexistent when I wear these, and while the pain isn't totally relieved, it is definitely much improved. I'm not limping after a busy day or two like I was. They also help with travelling when my ankles and feet would get really swollen, no more when wearing these.I did see a few reviews with the upper band hurting, and it did for the first week or so, but after breaking them in I don't even notice I'm wearing them, they're very comfortable. I wear a 10.5 wide women's and the XL fits my feet great. I'm 6'1"" and they're just barely tall enough though, so if you're taller than that they may be a bit short. They also stay put really well.My only complaints are just be careful pulling them up, I've put a couple holes in mine from my nails on the mesh parts. They also seem to attract pet hair and it clings on the bottom of them. Neither of these detract from my overall satisfaction though, as they do what they need to do, and do it well. I've ordered multiple sets of these.",5
B07VWT4XRG,The box was not sealed . 1 of the pairs came used but was an emergency needed so I keep the socks.,4
B07VWT4XRG,The fit good with good support,5
B07VWT4XRG,Love the colors. Took a wear or two to break them in,5
B07VWT4XRG,Fit great and give good support. The compression is not too much.,5
B07VWT4XRG,They fit nice and tight and hopefully will work for my circulation,5
B07VWT4XRG,Better than hospital issued for sure.,5
B07VWT4XRG,True fit and seem to help.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Very comfortable and great quality,5
B07VWT4XRG,Very stretchy! The colors are clear and they are very durable. Very stylish and exactly i was looking for and the added support. Great value for the money!,5
B07VWT4XRG,"These are great compression socks that do their job. However, the material is not very high quality and holes get formed easily. Also, hair and literally any fiber that comes into contact with these piles up and sticks to them like a magnet",4
B07VWT4XRG,"Needed for a long flight.  When tried on, feel perfect.",5
B07VWT4XRG,Very nice fit,4
B07VWT4XRG,A little too tight. Work excellent,4
B07VWT4XRG,I have bought these several times because the basic colors look nice and not hideous like traditional compression stockings and they last more than a year with frequent washing and wear.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Nice and very comfortable!,5
B07VWT4XRG,"Hard wearing, great fit, low-key (good) aesthetic.",5
B07VWT4XRG,"I was looking for complression socks for when i travel, these are the best!",5
B07VWT4XRG,"Three different colors, very good durability, very stretchy, keep feet warm, Support, great value for the money.",5
B07VWT4XRG,Love these socks so comfy and legs feel great after standing at work all day,5
B07VWT4XRG,Love the socks! Easy to put on and take off. They are very comfortable!,5
B07VWT4XRG,Good tight material that gives good support.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Compared with other brands they are more comfortable and easier to put on,5
B07VWT4XRG,Good looking. Pleasant to wear. Not as tight as prescription medical compression socks. My legs feel great! Have recommended to my friends.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"Brought for my mother, she loves them",5
B07VWT4XRG,These are good compression socks.. And the feel more like socks for a change..,4
B07VWT4XRG,The socks fit perfect.  I ordered the small.  They help with aching legs at the end of the day.,5
B07VWT4XRG,They keep the swelling down in my legs.,5
B07VWT4XRG,My mom needed compression socks. She's under 100 pounds. Skinny legs. Small to medium was too small. Left marks! Still like them. In need to order L to XL,4
B07VWT4XRG,Bright colors. Very functional. Helps keep swelling of lower legs and ankles in check.,5
B07VWT4XRG,Very comfy . Fit is outstanding,5
B07VWT4XRG,"They are fine, a perfect fit and comfortable!",5
B07VWT4XRG,"The way they feel , comfort. The compression ,moisture .love the socks",5
B07VWT4XRG,"These socks are great! I have tried multiple styles of compression socks and these are my new favorite! I love the material. They are more like regular breathable socks, not that nylon feel. On my feet at work all day is taking a toll on my legs, but these work great to give them the extra support I need. I'll definitely buy more!",5
B07VWT4XRG,Easy to get on and off.,5
B07VWT4XRG,"I used one of these to go on a 3 hour drive and it kept my ankle from swelling. I wore one for about 3 days and it began to be too tight around the top. Since I want them for travel, I was glad to have them to keep that ankle from swelling.",4
B07VWT4XRG,"Love them! Size xl was a perfect fit for my husband with chronically swollen legs working long hours. Not too tight while still doing their job and reducing swelling. They're a bit difficult to put on, but that could just be operator error and the fact that his leg was super swollen from a bicycle accident. I highly recommend!",5
B008M5S09S,"I got these for my man, he really likes them. And even though they're slightly big on me, i liked them so much, he ended up giving me a few to keep. Lol. They're so soft, comfortable, warm and thick right where you want them to be. Good quality, good stretch, price and I'm betting they'll last a while, too. The lines on the toes aren't too annoying either. Much warmer than typical sock I get. He really likes them too. I think I'll get us both more. Lol.",5
B008M5S09S,"They were delivered the very next day just like promised. They fit well, wash and dry, and are very comfortable and durable. I would recommend them to anyone!",5
B008M5S09S,"True to its advertising, these socks are warm, soft and keeps your feet dry. There is a velvety softness to the socks and fits snuggly around my feet. However I noticed pilling only after wearing them a few times. Granted, I shuffle my feet and I'm walking on carpet most days, but it is something to keep in mind of. Fortunately, these are rather affordable.A sidenote: I went against Amazon's recommended size (going up to an L instead of M and I'm glad I did. You know your feet and shoe size. Go with that instead of Amazon's automated suggestion.",4
B008M5S09S,"Great product. They're my favorite to use throughout the week and I'll likely order another set when I need more. In terms of quality, these have a nice thickness, are warm, hold up well, and are comfortable. They stay in place nicely throughout the day and are easily worth the price.",5
B008M5S09S,"I had been looking for socks that fits my husband big feet. His shoes size are 14, well I found it . These socks fit him perfectly and still have room in it . He said they are very comfortable to wear and he is very happy now I found finally socks that fit his big feet and he doesn't has to force them to put it on . He is very happy .. highly recommend it for those who has size 14..this is true to size. I got him the largest one.I will definitely buy this ones from now on.",5
B008M5S09S,"Value for money, color Kool, durable, easy to put on, cotton nice,very supportive of feet, durable color nice support good",5
B008M5S09S,"To start with, I have nerve damage in my right foot.My old socks I would have to make sure the seam of the sock was just right.But with these socks seam is at the end of the sock landing in the toe nail area. Why in the world have they not always been made like this!These are just the right thickness so that I can wear them with my house slippers (very cold Ohio nights) and very comfortable in my shoes/boots.Calf height is very good as well as the support.I will definitely buy again and recommend them to anyone looking to get away from that annoying seam across your toe knuckles.",5
B008M5S09S,"I have to say when I first ordered these I was wondering to myself why I would use wool socks in the summer or spring, but then realized that these use the same kind of wool that my hunting clothes do and immediately became a fan. These socks will moisture wick any sweat that you might have and they breathe a lot better than the cotton socks that you're accustomed to wearing. Besides, in the winter and fall months, they are a godsend. I would get these and throw away those cotton socks in an instant, you won't be disappointed.",5
B008M5S09S,I am glad i bought these socks.  They are thick enough to provide a cushion for my feet and I like the extra arch support in the socks.  The are breathable as described and my feet remain comfortably dry for over eight hours of work.  They maintain their shape after several machine washing and drying.  I definitely will be buying more.,5
B008M5S09S,"Socks! you gotta love 'em. I put them on my feet.Seriously tho....These are durable socks. Comfortable mostly. They don't stretch or shrink. Gray is the way to go as I gave up white socks when I got to high school. All grown up now, wearing my Dickies socks... on my feet. They're gray. You'll love 'em. That's my Socks! review. Hope you found it helpful.",5
B008M5S09S,"I am elderly and sometimes, even putting on socks can be a challenge.  These socks are foot friendly and very easy to slip on.They are durable, comfortable, and keep my feet warm without having to wear slippers around the house.",5
B008M5S09S,"My husband & brother both love these socks for artic cold weather!  Great for shoveling snow and snowmobiling!  However, hang dry them or they will shrink a bit!",5
B008M5S09S,"Thick and high-quality socks, durable over time. I wrote the review after years of massive use, including regular use of a clothes dryer, and the socks are like new. Also excellent for those sensitive to sweat and fungi. Note that the sock is very thick",5
B008M5S09S,"Great socks that don't move around, durable, soft, and comfortable. The main reason I buy them is the simple fact that they stay in place all day long...",5
B008M5S09S,I bought the socks for work and they feel great and fit great. I will definitely buy them again.,5
B008M5S09S,Nice quality product.Putting on these socks is like giving my feet a warm hug. Seriously. This is my second time buying them. The first ones lasted a very long time. So long that I had forgotten how it feels to pull on brand new socks.The price helps me to not feel guilty going shoeless all day (I work from home). They're easily and cheaply replaced.,5
B008M5S09S,"Great everyday socks not from China!  (Pakistan) I'm happy to find these because I can't in good conscience buy Carhartt anymore since they brutally fired their employees who didn't want the experimental vaccine, even when it became evident that it wasn't effective in stopping the spread.",5
B008M5S09S,"Bought for my husband, these are the only brand of socks he wears. I normally just pick up a single pack when his are starting to wear out but decided to get more of a bulk order here. No regrets. They fit and he's happy.",5
B008M5S09S,These regular socks are more thick and soft then your usual socks very good quality I'm very happy with my purchase probably the best socks I've ever had i will definitely purchase again I dislike polyester doesn't let your skin breathe going to see if they have some really cold weather socks for motorcycle riding in winter,4
B008M5S09S,Great quality very durable med thickness great with my work boots fit good size 10.,5
B008M5S09S,"Love the fit, feel and comfort of these socks and the price is right.",5
B008M5S09S,"I bought these for my son and he loved them! They are nice and warm, go with everything! And of course great price!",5
B008M5S09S,Great winter socks. Warm yet not too bulky. The gray color is a great option.,5
B008M5S09S,"These socks are great for those who like a more thick sock - they're not super tight, but they provide the perfect support for frequent sneaker wearers like me (and ag a great price).",5
B008M5S09S,"I like these well enough, they are fluffy and last correctly.  However, I feel the quality has dropped from great to adequate.  Elastic, etc, slightly weaker each time.  (I've ordered them 5 years in a row as why research something new.)  Since that matches the average price, make your decision.",4
B008M5S09S,I bought these for my son who sweats a lot. He says there comfortable and good quality,4
B008M5S09S,"I never thought I'd leave a review for socks, but I had to.  I have troubles with my feet and socks at times. Specifically, moisture wicking as I tend to have over perspiration in my hooves.  These socks are incredible.  Fantastic quality, very comfortable, and impressive with moisture wicking.  Extremely satisfied.  You will be, too.",5
B008M5S09S,Love these! I work 12 hour shifts on a ferry with 400 thinsulate boots. These made it so much more comfortable and my feet stayed dry! Awesome socks!,5
B008M5S09S,The fit and feel of these socks in very nice. Wal-Mart sold out for X-mas so I got these here.A good value.,5
B008M5S09S,Always a great buy. Fit great and hold up for quite awhile.,5
B008M5S09S,"Wearing them for my hiking trips, like how soft and cushioned that these socks are. And I really like the fluorescent green color.",5
B008M5S09S,Still very good support after many washings and dryings. Would buy again.,5
B008M5S09S,Size is good and price was great.  I use these as my everyday winter sock and really like them.  Would buy again.,5
B008M5S09S,"Extremely comfortable, was pleasantly surprised. Great deal for the price and quality.",5
B008M5S09S,"These are tall enough to wear high boots, plus are very comfortable.  They stay up without being tight.  I have bought 2 different sizes of these for different people and instead of trying to match up based on length, you can easy tell which is which becauase the size is stitched just inside the top of the sock.  A very convient feature.  Will definetely buy again.",5
B008M5S09S,"Great socks for the price , doesn't shrink in the washer , feels good inside a sneaker or a boot. Would buy again",5
B008M5S09S,Mt husband loves the socks and loves the fit! They are very durable and perfect thickness!,5
B008M5S09S,My family asked me for socks every Christmas. I buy the men Dickies socks every year. They now have a surplus of them because they are strong and durable and comfortable,5
B008M5S09S,Great summer socks for the working man. Durable and keeps feet dry. Soft and mid calf height. Non slip and easy to put on. Hold up when washing and non piling.,5
B008M5S09S,I've reordered these several times. Excellent socks. Durable and long lasting.,5
B008M5S09S,"Great quality, color was perfect and the value for the price was great they are comfortable they stay up on your leg",5
B008M5S09S,Hey this is a good deal all the way around good socks fit right I got a big foot but they're nice durable colors cool they're going to last I think it's been a while already,4
B008M5S09S,They fit just right and were as comfortable as I expected.,5
B008M5S09S,"My farmer husband says these are the best winter socks! They keep his feet warm and dry in his boots. These were a sale special and bought them to try and now I am buying more. They wash well and the elastic has held up. He is a sock snob, usually only wearing gold toes so this is high praise from him indeed!",5
B008M5S09S,"I bought these socks in November of 2019, have worn a pair every day since then, and they are finally getting holes and needing to be replaced now, January of 2025.",5
B008M5S09S,Right size for my foot size. It keeps my foot warm.,5
B008M5S09S,Good quality.  My husband loves these!  Just wash and dry with other black clothes.,5
B008M5S09S,I bought these to wear camping and hunting and love them.  I also wear to work w my On Clouds!!,5
B008M5S09S,"I've ordered several times; socks wash well and last well for my husband, who walks and stands a lot.  Good cushioning for the feet, too.",5
B008M5S09S,I just put on a pair of these socks right now. I can only say WOW. They are no doubt the most comfortable socks I have worn in a long time. I'm looking forward to do a long walk with these on. Thank you DICKIES,5
B008M5S09S,They fit well they were comfortable they wee a good price,5
B008M5S09S,Perfect fit. Our son loves them. And they're very comfortable.,5
B008M5S09S,"Warm, comfortable, and made with quality for a lasting product",5
B008M5S09S,"These socks are the only socks I buy.  Seriously.  Don't buy other socks.  Just buy these.  Comfortable, they stay up, they take years to wear out.  Just wear these.",5
B008M5S09S,Great prodct as described very warm in cold temps,5
B008M5S09S,These socks are so comfortable. They're like walking on clouds!,5
B008M5S09S,"Great durability and extremely good value for cost , if you light a higher calf height then definitely try these",5
B008M5S09S,They love the fit and moisture wicking.  They would all rate them a >5 if it was an option!,5
B008M5S09S,"I've been wearing these socks for years (yes, I wash them!) and think they are the best socks I've ever purchased. They are very comfortable and well-made. Yes, like all socks, they will get holes in them eventially, but only after a lot of wear. Socks don't last forever.",5
B008M5S09S,Exactly what I expected good quality and great price,5
B008M5S09S,I would highly recommend these socks.  Comfortable and warm.,5
B008M5S09S,Dickies socks are the only socks I buy. They last the longest out of all the socks I have tried. Super comfortable breathable socks. I wear steel toe boots all day. These socks last longer than my boots.,5
B008M5S09S,These socks are made different than any base sock. I really enjoy the comfort of walking in these socks.,5
B008M5S09S,"My feet are pretty dang large (13), and this size is actually too big! I'd say get this size if you've got a size 15 foot",4
B008M5S09S,"I am disappointed with these Dickies socks.  I have bought two orders of these heavy work socks and they are very good and heavy made for winter. wear. This last order is supposed to be the same socks only they were about a third thinner.  More like summer work socks.  Dickies why?Update, I was wrong about the socks.  I was sent the lighter summer socks instead of the heavy duty winter socks that I thought I was ordering.  My mistake and not Dickies!",5
B008M5S09S,The XL are perfect for my 9 EEE feet. The are exactly what I needed for my work boots,5
B008M5S09S,"I recently purchased Dickies Men's Dri-Tech Moisture Control Crew Socks, and they've been a solid addition to my wardrobe. These socks come in packs of 6, 12, or 18 pairs, offering a good range of options depending on your needs. I opted for the 12-pair pack, which provides enough to rotate through a couple of weeks.The Dri-Tech technology in these socks really stands out. They do an excellent job at wicking moisture away, which is great for keeping my feet dry and comfortable throughout the day, even in warmer conditions or during physical activities. The fit is snug without being too tight, and they offer sufficient arch support that helps in reducing foot fatigue.",4
B008M5S09S,These sox are a great way to keep your feet comfortable through the workday!  Definitely buying again!,5
B008M5S09S,Bought for work as delivery associate/ Box Jockey. Still in good shape over a year later. Would buy again.,5
B008M5S09S,"Got them for my friend who is a custodian, he says that they wick very well and are very cushy and comfortable. He says he'd buy them again.",5
B008M5S09S,What I had hoped for.  Nice socks.,5
B008M5S09S,Socks are used by 17 year old boy. They stay up & have not stretched or shrunk after many washings.,5
B008M5S09S,After a long 10hr shift daily I come home to my feet feeling fresh and oderless will buy again!,5
B008M5S09S,"Husband loves these, they have the thickness in toes, heel and bottom. Wash nice, stay in place and comes up the leg nice",5
B008M5S09S,I bought Dickies mens socks for my son this Christmas. He loves them. They help keep his legs and feet warm and dry. I would definitely buy them again.,5
B008M5S09S,Comfortable in my Arias boots...Accurate sizing....Very good value,5
B008M5S09S,"Soft, comfortable & sturdy socks- highly recommend. Tried other brands but disappointed, usually too thin and cheap.",5
B008M5S09S,The socks are not as thick. They are ok,4
B008M5S09S,Got these for my Fiance and he loved them!,5
B008M5S09S,"Really like these socks, especially for the price.",5
B008M5S09S,Greta quality and material. For perfect,5
B008M5S09S,"The elastic top seemed to loosen up.  They don't fall down but aren't very supportive anymore.  I have had them for 2 months.4 stars because as a sock they perform, but I don't like that they stretched out.",4
B008M5S09S,"Been using these for a few years.  But the same in gray recently, because I like them.Good socks at a good price.Being partially synthetic, they have just a little less grip then my prior socks.  NOT a problem.  Just different.  Because of this, they bunch up less than my prior socks, but do feel a little different on hard flooring.Would buy again.",5
B008M5S09S,"Foot part fits fine. Not the part that covers ankle WAY. To tight.Other than that, good quality. Would not buy it again.",4
B008M5S09S,These are comfortable socks at a fair price.,5
B008M5S09S,Socks fit perfectly!  Smaller foot guys; These are for you. Size Medium fits my size 9 foot perfectly. I would recommend these to anyone and everyone!,5
B008M5S09S,"I like these socks but they are inconsistent in size. All are marked internally as xl but several pairs are obviously only large. Those pairs are 1/2"" or more shorter in the foot making them short for my size 13 foot. Other than this inconsistentcy the socks are a good value with the right amount of compression and they keep my feet dry. Very happy other than the size issue.",4
B07YH9NDLW,The fit is perfect.  Soft. Stylish. Well Made. I will be buying more in different colors.,5
B07YH9NDLW,"I wanted a heavyweight pair of sweat pants, for the colder weather. These are not what I expected. They are not made to be loose fitting. I would compare them to the idea of ""skinny jeans"". The sizing and tapering is not generous. I'm not a skinny jeans kind of person. The waist band is still wide and comfortable. They have ""cuffs"" at the bottom of the legs. I actually appreciated that, because it doesn't leave gaps, for cold air to enter. But, it won't allow for wearing something like boots. They won't expand enough to pullover the top of the boots. I did find that they are quite good at preventing cold air to penetrate through the material. Except, the interior material against your skin...doesn't have that warm and comfy feel that I expected. It has a bit of a ""chilling"" effect. For whatever reason. You don't exactly feel cold, but you definitely don't feel warm either. In this respect, they are really unusual. Still, they are well-made, and good quality. I was indifferent about returning them. I could still wear them when the temperature is maybe above 50 degrees. Even though I still don't like the ""skinny jeans"" fit. So, I just kept shopping for another pair of sweatpants that were truly - heavyweight and warm...",3
B07YH9NDLW,"pretty much said it all in ""headline"".  cotton is such a good fabric.  these joggers are well made, comfortable.  haven't been able to find same qualities in lady's wear...  always some polystuff in nearly everything.  anyway, i like these so much, gifted two pair to nephew, one pair to niece and this is my second pair.  i plan to be comfy during this coming cold weather  if you are female and worry about ""fashion"", just embroidery a flower or butterfly on lower leg or some other feminizing thing and enjoy!!! even in this brand, the blue joggers have a lot of polyester .try these.  you may really like them.",5
B07YH9NDLW,"The thickness of the material is good and added warmth on colder days with fleece lining throughout. Cuffs at ankles are nice and fitting, not to tight or bothersome. Length is perfect.  The waist has a wider elastic than most with the tie strings sewn into the middle. These sweatpants stay up on the waist without tying, even with keys and wallet. I would tie anyway because I usually carry my phone in my pocket if I don't have a jacket or coat. Seams appear to be well seen.  No zippers on the 2 side pockets, but they're deep so nothing should be to where it's gonna fall out. Good quality sweatpants for the price. I feel fortunate I didn't run into any problems that other reviewers experienced",5
B07YH9NDLW,"I usually like the champion weave but the pockets in the sweatpants are shallow. My cell phone always drops whenever I would put it the sweatpants pocket. I have a small cell phone.These gym people sweats aren't as heavy but heavy enough. The pockets are very deep which is important to me. My S22 cell never falls from these pockets.I'm happy with my purchase. These sweats are well made and they don't shrink in the washer and drawer cycles. I have the navy color and I'm very happy with the fit, look and feel. I would recommend them and I will definitely purchase them again.",4
B07YH9NDLW,"I have bought these three times, twice in 2021, once in 2024, the first two pairs I purchased were very soft and comfortable, and I would give 5 stars for them, it said (fleece-lined black).  The pair I purchased in 2024 I went to my previous purchases and hit buy again, then got another, it came and its not as soft as the pairs that came before.  I can feel that their are two layers in the 2021 pairs and very soft. In the 2024 pair its only a single layer, the outside & inside is more rugged, which is probably good for durability, but not for comfort IMO.",4
B07YH9NDLW,"Top quality material all around but runs small in the waist and the ankles have too small an opening for comfort. Pants are hard to put on over heels and take off and waist is tighter than other pants of same size so ORDER A SIZE UP and you will have a good purchase. UPDATE: I bought a size up from Medium to Large (I am 6'2"" 160 lbs/34"" waist) and still tight on the ankles.",4
B07YH9NDLW,"Fits good and comfortable, they have  nice comfortable satin lining inside. In my opinion they are very loose definitely a good option for price, fit, and feel.",4
B07YH9NDLW,"At first glance, they are perfect.  However, they developed a hole on the inside left pocket at the first wash.",4
B07YH9NDLW,Form fitting but not restrictive. Thick and interior fleece is silky smooth.,5
B07YH9NDLW,"Fantastic quality, material is thick but soft and durable. Very breathable. Highly recommend.",5
B07YH9NDLW,These fit nice and are comfortable. I would buy again,5
B07YH9NDLW,It is really comfortable and nice to walk around in. I use them to do errands and looks nice compared to my other ones. The value for the money is really good.,5
B07YH9NDLW,Much tighter fitting than I expected.,4
B07YH9NDLW,Decent pants that were purchased using the size chart. Large should have been the correct size but is too small for my grandson. Now have to return and the price is higher to buy again. Not happy.,4
B07YH9NDLW,Weird texture.,4
B07YH9NDLW,"I bought these for my husband and he liked them enough we are buying a second pair. He liked the waistband, and the fact that they didn't feel like they were falling down all the time. The picture shown makes the back seam look like a flap. It isn't, and they don't look funny on.",5
B07YH9NDLW,Got these for my husband and he wears them all the time. Comfortable and holding up well,5
B07YH9NDLW,"As opposed to what the reviews are saying, the pants I received are not good at colder weather, thin rabric and fleece, baggy.Length is good.",4
B07YH9NDLW,"I purchased these as a gift for my son. He loves them. Good quality, nice material and fit. TTS.",5
B07YH9NDLW,I really like the quality of this product. Would recommend.  Keeps me warm in winters,5
B07YH9NDLW,Great pants! Large size for 6'1 fits perfect. Highly recommend.,5
B07YH9NDLW,I loved to cozy feel of these pants and the nifty snugness at the bottom of each leg.  Wonderful multi-ringed waist.,5
B07YH9NDLW,"Bought first pair, perfect! bought a second pair, too short!",4
B07YH9NDLW,"The description said relaxed/ loose fit. Something to that effect. I'm not looking it back up to see exactly. However, it's not. I ordered a size that I order on all my other sweats that usually try and fall off of me. This one was almost like wearing skinny jeans. Perhaps the sizing is off. I recommend ordering at least one. Maybe two sizes larger than you think you need. If you want loose fit, comfortable sweats. Those were hugging my front and back uncomfortably. I gave them to my son who is much smaller than me and they fit him fine. I guess the bottom line is the product is pretty much as described, however, the sizing runs small in my opinion.",3
B07YH9NDLW,"These sweatpants are the best pair I have ever owned.  I have owned at one point all types of sweats from J Crew, Gap, Bonobos and Lulu Lemon.  These are easily the most comfortable pair I've ever owned.  Price cannot be beat.",5
B07YH9NDLW,"I bought these for my son.  He likes that the fit is not too tight.  He says the texture is soft and fabric is heavy so it's warm. He is 5'11"" at 180 lbs.",5
B07YH9NDLW,"Fleece lining is soft, fit is non restricting while complimenting and comfy",5
B07YH9NDLW,"the fit was great--just lost 125lbs, needed some sort of sweat pant..they were and are a great product for the money...",5
B07YH9NDLW,good,5
B07YH9NDLW,I purchased two pair last year when my son was going through his chemotherapy treatments. He says they are very comfortable and continues to wear them so decided to surprise him with another pair. He wears them constantly and to his follow up Immunotherapy treatments. They stand up to multiple washes very well.,5
B07YH9NDLW,"For the price these are a great deal! They are super warm and after multiple washing, the color has not faded. Quality product.",5
B07YH9NDLW,Husband likes this product very much,5
B07YH9NDLW,"Warm, soft, lining is like velvet. My son says they get a bit hot for school gym with the lining, but otherwise he really likes them.",5
B07YH9NDLW,"Nice fit, just the right weight material",5
B07YH9NDLW,Very impressive lined warm joggers I will be buying more in the near future,5
B07YH9NDLW,They were soft and comfortable and looked great! The fit was great,5
B07YH9NDLW,My 24yr old son loved these as a Christmas present!!!,5
B07YH9NDLW,"It's a shame, really, these sweatpants were excellent in 2023, now they have lower quality material, are smaller, and not dyed as well.  They've made them skinny fit, so, they slide down your backside when you bend over or sit.",3
B07YH9NDLW,Still soft and comfy after many washes. Will buy again,5
B07YH9NDLW,I would say for your money they are an okay pair of lounge pants. Thin material super smooth and soft feel. Would be best for around the house.,3
B07YH9NDLW,Good quality,5
B07YH9NDLW,"These are very comfortable pants, with convenient pockets and a nice fit.  They wash well.  I use them for doing Tai Chi and they move nicely.  The reason for the three stars is that they took so long to arrive!  The date kept getting pushed further and further.",3
B07YH9NDLW,Very well made.,5
B07YH9NDLW,Comfortable-good fit-especially like that the deep pockets have a smooth inner lining-the waist is also more than just a string,5
B07YH9NDLW,In fact they are more warm then I was expecting. I prefer the non fleece lining version. I am disappointed they only have 2 options for non fleece version. I feel like I can wear the non fleece version all year round. The fleece version makes me hot and sweaty. Can only wear them in the winter time when it's really cold. They are good quality though. Nice deep pockets I purchased all of them. I'm just disappointed in the lack of variety in color options and the lack in more non fleece options.,4
B07YH9NDLW,My husband loves these pants. They are warm and comfortable and fit well. I will reorder.,5
B07YH9NDLW,Quality of product is good. But size is an issue as mentioned in many reviews. Size is bigger than mentioned. Maybe running it through steam dryer a couple of times might help.,3
B07YH9NDLW,"These are super thick and warm.  The photo looks white but they are a nice light heather gray. My son will only wear sweats and these are thick enough for the winter, as long as it's not raining or snowing. My teen is picky about fit and pockets, these have no weird seems and are very soft inside. They are a more relaxed baggy fit, which my son prefers. I bought the black pair as well.My son is about 5'5"" and 110lbs, the Medium fit great with room to grow.",5
B07YH9NDLW,Not warner than typical sweatpants.,3
B07YH9NDLW,Sent back.  Too small.,3
B07YH9NDLW,"*** Update as of 11/7/2023***Removing 1 star because I ordered another pair of these sweat pants and I compared the two and there are some slight tweaks that make the newer sweat pants inferior to the old ones. I will say that in today's economy, to see that these pants have not gone up in price in a few years is mind blowing, but it's at the cost of some lower quality materials. The key difference between the two pairs is the interior lining is not as soft. I'm no fabric expert but I can see that the length of the fabric hairs is much shorter on the newer item, causing the interior lining to feel less ""fuzzy"" and a bit more scratchy. For $30 you can't go wrong with these sweat pants but it's a shame they changed their ways.*** OG Review ***I work from home, so a good pair of sweat pants is essential for me. I've tried Walmart brand, all the way to Filson brand sweat pants and I have to say, for the price these sweat pants are the best you can get by far! My favorite are probably my Duluth Trading Company sweat pants but those are close to double the cost.",4
B07YH9NDLW,"I expected the fleece to be like fleece inside of a hoodie. Oh no. THIS IS VELVET!!! They are so so sooo luxurious feeling. The CUT of these sweats is worth paying the few extra dollars more. They aren't just a generic ugly rectangle like hanes and fruit of the loom and other basic brands. They are cut very very well to fit your body and im willing to pay more for an incredible fit. I did have to size up like usual with joggers so they aren't leggings tight. I usually order XXL in men's sweats but I had to send those back for a 3XL. They don't fit 100% perfect since they're made for a men's body but I'm still very satisfied with them and they are so warm and comfy. They are 100% cotton on the outside which I appreciate,  I hate cheap polyester feel. I dried them for 15 mins then let them air dry and they barely shrank at all. I would absolutely buy these again and hoping they don't start producing cheap tint Chinese fitted clothes like every other brand seems to be doing. PLEASE keep your high quality standards The Gym People! I will keep buying these again and again after they wear out!(I'm 5'9"" and around 250lbs) if you are a girl with a big booty make sure you size up 1-2 sizes because these are made for a man's booty lol",5
B07YH9NDLW,"Really wish they were 100% cotton. Well made, great style. Had to return.",3
B07YH9NDLW,Returned due to the size and a little baggier than I wanted.,5
B07YH9NDLW,Nice feel but size chart doesn't match for waist at all and fit isn't loose at all. I got a large and waist is uncomfortably tight for the size it gave and inseam is way to short. Have to keep reaching down to pull the bottom of the pants down cause there is no looseness at all. Hate these pants.,3
B07YH9NDLW,They were too big....nothing else wrong and except Size,3
B07YH9NDLW,"I bought these for my kids and they did not like the heavier fabric and bulky look. They were comparing these to another brand they have and like. I actually like the pants and use them for myself because I just wear them around the house and they feel fine. Teenage boys might not appreciate these, but I like them. I'm giving these a 3 based on the mixed reviews in the household.",3
B07YH9NDLW,I've had a couple of pairs for almost 2 years that keep warm and feel great. The newer pair I just got is noticeably not as warm and has a tighter fit around the waist.,3
B07YH9NDLW,"These are very well made, a comfortable mid-weight. I purchased these to assess before buying a second pair... will be making that additional purchase.",5
B07YH9NDLW,I would reccomend at least one size up if not two. Runs very small. Will be exchanging. Otherwise good material.,3
B07YH9NDLW,Awesome,5
B07YH9NDLW,"I bought the sweatpants for casual getting-about-town and jogging.  I am pleased with the quality of the fabric and the fleece lining will make the sweats warm enough even for Wisconsin winters, but certainly too warm for summer wear.  The elastic waistband is 2 inches wide, and provides superior support and expandability.  The pockets are indeed deep.  Im a 6ft male, 205lbs with a 43in waist.  I fall between the x-large and 2x-large sizes depending on the maker of the item.  For me these x-large sweats are snug but wearable.  It is advertised as 'loose-fit style' but for me the tapered style of these sweats is snug.  Nothing loose about it.  Im planning on getting another pair, 2xl this time.  I ordered and received a 2xl pair of the sweatpants.  To my disappointment it was not larger, it was the same size as the xl I originally ordered. So I returned the 2xl sweats.  I bought a 3xl pair and they fit oh so comfortably.",5
B07YH9NDLW,Excellent quality very pleased,5
B07YH9NDLW,"I heard how soft these were in other reviews, and while the inner lining itself is very soft, the material the joggers are made out of is quite stiff and not particularly comfortable. These fit kind of awkward, with an overly tight waist band and the legs being baggy and not fitted at all as the description led me to believe. Would not find these ideal to wear around the house, and definitely not ideal for lounging. Likely to return.",2
B07YH9NDLW,"Sizing was very off. A medium fit like MC hammer pants. I got the gray and the black, and they were completely different fits. The black was loose from the ankle to the knee, then tight through the quads and seat of the pants. The gray was loose throughout, with almost twice as much excess material in the seat of the pants. Returned.",2
B07YH9NDLW,I wanted all Cotton & these came fleece lined. I got them At Christmas & got a great price - They are the best I have ever owned.,5
B07YH9NDLW,"the size is extra large, for the ""large"" selection",4
B07YH9NDLW,"I trusted my instinct and ordered the large over the recommendation of the sizing chart for an XL.  I have a 36"" waist. The large is a snug fit, which is what I want to keep it from sliding down when I'm running.The pants are well made, with 95% cotton body, 5% spandex in body.  95% polyester insert and 5% spandex insert.  I found this on an inner label.  I would have preferred the cotton on the inside against my skin, but it's not a huge issue for me.The spandex is pretty wide and works well to keep the pants snug.  I don't need to use the drawstring.  There is an elastic cuff on the bottom of the pants which keeps it from being too long for me.  Costs a bit more than the cheaper sweatpants, but worth it.",5
B07YH9NDLW,"I got the lined black sweatpants and they are exceptional quality. Very thick and soft on the inside to this day (Got these a while ago). However, its pretty much all completely polyester, the lining is that shiny soft polyester, but that may a good thing since fleece or whatever dries up and bunches up after washing a couple dozen times. And for working out in, I at least wouldn't get the lined one, it's kind of gross to sweat in. You'll peel them off after a workout and everything will be all wet and slippery since this lining isn't really breathable. It all gets trapped inside. For casual wear they're amazing though, the fit is perfect, just like in the picture. 8.5/10",4
B07YH9NDLW,"Oddly, the light grey sweatpants are not the same fabric/color/pattern as the light grey hooded sweatshirt. I bought these to be a set, but they can't be worn together as the colors don't match.  This kind of detail is really annoying because it isn't disclosed. Won't bother with this company again.",2
B07YH9NDLW,"Wearing them now and they are comfortable, while fitting me nicely. The inside does seem velvet like and the bottom of the leg can be rolled up easily. I would have bought 2 pairs if they had a light color I liked, maybe check again later. Just be careful of the waist, I bought a large and wear a 38 waist [old man gut] for pants. I just hope it does not shrink. They seem to be made well so I can enjoy them for a few years.",5
B07YH9NDLW,"These are amazing for working out in,fits well and plenty of room for any work out. Only flaw is washing them. Make sure you have a laundry bag to put them and/or hang dry and do not wash in hot water. The drawstring will twist and tighten up from the heat and you can not pull out the drawstring. It is sewn into the waist band in the middle back portion. Besides that, amazing.",4
B07YH9NDLW,Great pants. I can wear them to bed or go to the store with them. Extremely comfortable and fit is perfect. I will buy more!,5
B076ZHMR3S,These ponchos worked well this past weekend at the Pro Am Golf Tournament at Pebble Beach.  Saved us from getting totally drenched.  Great price.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"As someone who enjoys outdoor concerts, I recently purchased the Hagon PRO Disposable Rain Ponchos for Adults in anticipation of an event with rain in the forecast. These ponchos seemed like a convenient solution to stay dry during the show. After using them, I'd like to share my experiences, highlighting the pros and cons of these rain ponchos.Pros:Lightweight and portable:One of the notable advantages of the Hagon PRO Disposable Rain Ponchos is their lightweight and compact design. They are incredibly easy to carry in a tote or bag, making them a convenient option for on-the-go use. Their portability ensures that you can be prepared for unexpected rain without any hassle.Easy to bring along:The ease of bringing these ponchos with you is another pro. They are simple to carry around, making them a practical choice for outdoor events, hikes, or any situation where sudden rain might occur. Their compact size allows you to have them on hand without taking up much space.Cons:Thin material:Despite claims of being the ""thickest"" poncho available, I found the material of these ponchos to be disappointingly thin. During use, it became evident that they provided minimal protection from the rain. The thinness of the material left our shins and lower legs exposed, resulting in them getting soaked.Ineffective at preventing overheating:The claim that the poncho has a ""unique design"" to prevent the sauna effect did not hold true in my experience. Especially when wearing the poncho after any exertion or physical activity, I found it became uncomfortably hot underneath. This heat buildup made it necessary to remove the poncho despite the rain, defeating its primary purpose.Hood doesn't stay up:One significant drawback was the hood's inability to stay in place. Throughout use, I constantly had to use one hand to hold up the hood, which proved to be quite inconvenient and limiting in terms of movement. A secure and functional hood is essential in a rain poncho, and this was a notable flaw.In conclusion, the Hagon PRO Disposable Rain Ponchos for Adults have their merits in terms of portability and ease of bringing them along for unexpected rain. However, their thin material provides limited rain protection, and they are prone to causing overheating, especially during physical activity. The ineffective hood design was also a notable drawback. While they are convenient to have on hand, their performance in terms of rain protection leaves much to be desired.",4
B076ZHMR3S,Bought it for when my family went to Walt Disney World in case of rain. Nice and small to fit in your back pack.  Worked great for a rain shower on one of our visits to the park.  Make sure to hang up when you get back to your hotel. I forgot about them after a couple of days on the bottom of the back pack they did have an odor.,5
B076ZHMR3S,Worked great for football games. Cheap and kept us dry,5
B076ZHMR3S,it was great,5
B076ZHMR3S,"With our sons Championship football game coming up and a high chance of rain, I figured it would make sense to find a poncho for myself and the rest of the family along with our umbrellas. Hence, the order here. The packaging is compact and overall it is lightweight and easy to store and keep with you when on the move. It did indeed start to rain enough that it was time to break out the poncho. It was easy enough to get on and fit me (6'1'' 280ish pounds). It seems decently made for a disposable one time use poncho (I guess you could in theory use it more than once if you take care to fold it up nicely.) The only reason why I did not give it a full 5 stars is that being that I am in the Chicago area and wind is an issue, it is a little too lightweight and easily moves with wind gusts. But overall, well worth the price and to use for a sports event or emergency use. I am going to put the rest in my car for any sort of emergency type situation moving ahead.",4
B076ZHMR3S,"light, reusable, rain protection, no color, no smell, comfort, light quality",5
B076ZHMR3S,Works well for travel or quick runs from car to store in the rain,4
B076ZHMR3S,Sturdy,5
B076ZHMR3S,Price and quality,5
B076ZHMR3S,Always good to have one on standby. Nice one.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"These are great. When it's windy they will blow all over the place, but when it's raining heavily, then they do help with keeping more water off of the legs, than say, an umbrella. I bought them for a recent trip to Australia and was so happy to have the with me as it can be very warm but also very rainy.",5
B076ZHMR3S,Kept the rain off of us in a rainstorm.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"We were going to our daughter's graduation and knew it was going to be pouring rain while we were all outdoors in Boston. These rain ponchos saved the day! They were so compact they fit in our very limited carry on bags--but were big enough to fit over our clothes/jackets too. I've tried others that all rip very easily, these were sturdier, withheld taking them on and off and can be used for another rainy weekend. My only issue is that once the package is opened it's very difficult to get them back to a small size to pack into a bag.",4
B076ZHMR3S,Easily packable in case you need it. Perfect for outdoor festivals.,5
B076ZHMR3S,Really didn't need them but they were there just incase...lightweight and handy!,4
B076ZHMR3S,I used this coat stops the rain falling on my head. I am somewhat happy so I will take one on Thanksgiving .  The raincoat does need a strap for your neck to keep drier.,5
B076ZHMR3S,Had multiple opportunities during a rainy season at Soccer ball games.,4
B076ZHMR3S,"While these are listed as disposable, I have been able to re-use mine. I just let them dry out and folded up as small as I could and put them in snack-size ziplock bags. I keep a couple in my car to have on hand. These are a great weight, very light. I have used the same one a couple of times and it hasn't ripped or torn. The only drawback for me of these is that there is no drawstring for the hoods. That would have made them perfect.",4
B076ZHMR3S,Ordered these ponchos for a trip to a theme park.  They are very thin and run a little small for an adult.,4
B076ZHMR3S,I bought a few of these to have on hand for just in case while travelling.  It is nice to have something that is compact for packing to count on if the weather turns rainy.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Los ponchos en color clear, son de buena calidad no se rompen facilmente los puedes reutilizar varias veces.",4
B076ZHMR3S,"These are thinner than others we've used, but did the trick. They're also cheap enough to toss without being sad about it.",4
B076ZHMR3S,"I heard it might be rainy, so I picked up some rain ponchos for the Sting / Billy Joel concert in San Diego a few months ago.  It was lightly sprinkling the whole time, so glad I had it!  Even Sting commented something like ""this is southern California, I thought this didn't happen here?""  But he and Billy Joel still put on great shows!",4
B076ZHMR3S,Compact and fits larger person. Easy to carry in backpack for ER,5
B076ZHMR3S,Great to keep in car or backpack when out and about. No kid wants to keep an umbrella handy but these take up no room in backpacks and have saved the day on multiple occasions. Great that they can keep their backpacks on so all their stuff stays dry also! Everyone groans when I give it to them to keep just in case but they are so appreciative when they need to use them!!Good general fit. Quality is good for one time use.,4
B076ZHMR3S,Ponchos worked - small and able to throw in our bags to go to the theme park. Used over the weekend more than once.,4
B076ZHMR3S,"I highly suggest this if you are going to theme parks. They are light, inexpensive, have a hood. I ordered blue as I wanted to be different then everyone that are purchasing white or clear and it was easier to find my family. Was impressed with the quality and durability of them. We used them for 2 days!!! I will definitely buy a new set for our next trip.",5
B076ZHMR3S,"Bought these for a cruise. Great size for tweens, teens, and adults.",5
B076ZHMR3S,Worked well for use at Disney World to carry in backpacks in case of rain. Priced economically. Good coverage except for face (reason I chose 4 instead of 5 stars). The hood could extend further on top & sides to protect face. Otherwise worked great. I keep the extras in my car for unexpected rain when running errands.,4
B076ZHMR3S,"I bought these in case I get stuck out in a sudden downpour while walking my dog on a cloudy day. I removed one from its pouch to see what it was like. It took quite a while to unfold and open the rain poncho up. Then I couldn't get it back in its little plastic bag properly so it is now a big bulgy thing that doesn't fit in my pocket anymore. It is probably about as good as you could expect for this type of product, especially if you are carrying it in a bag, purse, knapsack or whatever and the rain starts slowly. If I know it is going to rain I just keep my little dog inside where she has pee pads.",4
B076ZHMR3S,Visiting Disney theme park and it rained at the end of the night. Definitely came in handy.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"We purchased two packs, one clear and one yellow to keep on hand in case of storms. Very thing and lightweight for one time use, perhaps two. Comes nice and folded fits in palm, purse or jacket pocket. Priced right. Highly recommend them!",4
B076ZHMR3S,They'll fit in your pocket or purse in case you're at the game and it rains.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Used in Disney, worked great. Kept us dry and fit well on adults",5
B076ZHMR3S,Easy to use disposable ponchos. Great for concerts! Lightweight and waterproof!,4
B076ZHMR3S,"From picture and description we thought these were thicker than the see through  , thin plastic disposable rain coat.  Yes they worked as plastic, but saw right threw them, more than picture would have had you think.  Order was fast and on time and saved me trip to dollar store for their same product.  .",3
B076ZHMR3S,Was waterproof and easy to use for universal,5
B076ZHMR3S,We purchased these before our trip to Universal. They worked perfectly and I love the fact that there are multiples at such a great price.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"I bought this pack to keep a few in my bag that I take when we visit the Disney parks for the day. They are compact to carry, and they are a great price for the pack of them. Last time when went to Disney, we got stuck in a rain storm, and we got a chance to use these. They were easy to put on and kept us mostly dry long enough to get back to our car. I will definitely purchase more.",5
B076ZHMR3S,fits even adult males. great for travel because folds to small package.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Wore these while on horseback at a dude ranch over the Christmas holiday. Supplied them for the mm mmmppo family in case it rained, and it did!  They were the perfect weight and size for our group which ranged from ages 9-75!  They kept us dry so rain could not dampen our spirits during this special holiday adventure!",5
B076ZHMR3S,"We used these during the daily (sometimes twice or thrice daily) downpours while we were at Disney World.  They served our purpose.~ Be aware that the neck opening is small.  Of the four of us, only my daughter had no trouble getting her head through the opening.  Her head circumference is about 20.5"".  The rest of us struggled and had to tug firmly to get the poncho over our heads.  I was afraid they would rip because we had to pull so hard to get them on.~ I really wish I had gotten ponchos with a drawstring for the hood.  My daughter and I couldn't keep the hoods on (they kept falling backward off our heads) because we put our hair up in ponytails because of the heat.  My husband and son didn't have that problem. ~ They come in a very small package, and I was able to fit four in my handbag (more a tote than a purse).  They kept most of our bodies dry - didn't do anything to protect our feet but that was expected.~ They were relatively durable.  We were able to use them three times before they developed small tears along the neckline seam.  When they were wet, I rolled them up as tight as I could and put them in a waterproof bag.  I draped them over chairs at the hotel to allow them to dry overnight.  Once dry, I folded and rolled them similar to the way I fold and roll sleeping bags (fold in thirds then roll as tightly as possible).  They didn't return to their original small size, but they got very small and I could again fit four in my handbag.",4
B076ZHMR3S,"Needed ponchos for theme park water rides.  These ponchos were pretty decent.  They come individually wrapped fairly small which was nice to have them in the backpack while walking around the theme park.  Kept us dry.  You could use them more than once if you have something to store the wet poncho in.  Not the cheapest, but certainly a lot less then buying them in the park.",4
B076ZHMR3S,I took these on a trip to Orlando to multiple different parks they work well and are cheap enough to throw away. I like them because they are sleeveless which most today aren't and get really hot. These kept me much cooler in the Florida heat and don't take up too much room.,5
B076ZHMR3S,Longer sleeves would be betterAlso hood kept falling off  would appreciate strings,4
B076ZHMR3S,"Cheapest pancho you will find.  Thin plastic feels much like wearing a walmart bag.  Does keep the water off whatever it covers.  However, it is short.  Even your shorts will get wet.  For me @ 6' about halfway down my back pants pocket.",3
B076ZHMR3S,Having a pile of these in the car is a comfort.,5
B076ZHMR3S,Took these to Scotland for the Royal Military Tattoo. Perfect for sitting out in wind and rain and convenient to toss afterward.,5
B076ZHMR3S,5 reasonably priced disposable rain ponchos I purchased for an outdoor concert for me and my friends. They came in handy and kept us dry,5
B076ZHMR3S,they are thinner than I thought...,4
B076ZHMR3S,Used on water ride at California adventure! Kept my dry. Thin and tore after initial use so not for reuse. Would work for an emergency or one off water ride,3
B076ZHMR3S,Good purchase.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Do these look cool? Of course not. Do they take up almost no space and keep you, your clothes, and your purse or backpack out of the rain? 1000%. I've got these sprinkled around all over; a few in the car, a couple in my bag I carry for work, my wife has a couple she keeps in her work stuff and purse. Costs almost nothing, disappears until you need it, and does the job when it's time to work.",5
B076ZHMR3S,I love that these are disposable. They can be reused if you have time to let them dry. It didn't tear and fit over mom in her wheelchair.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Nice color, light weight but waterproof",5
B076ZHMR3S,I keep these in my go-bag in the trunk of my car just in case.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"These are not quite as durable as I would like, but they did a decent job staying on while at the beach during a storm. It will get warm because it is plastic and not breathable, so I did better with layers under it.",4
B076ZHMR3S,Perfect size to carry in a purse or tote.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Good enough, considering the price",4
B076ZHMR3S,Very thin ponchos but they do the job,4
B076ZHMR3S,Excelent option for Disney! Since it can be sunny one minute and rainning cats and dogs the other minute its an excelent idea always carring with ponchos. This is an excelent option.,4
B076ZHMR3S,As described,5
B076ZHMR3S,Does its purpose,4
B076ZHMR3S,They did their job. They are thin but they keep the water off you and keep you dry.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"I purchased these in a pinch for our trip to Disneyland. They worked well and did the job, but they are NOT red. As you can see in the picture, they look pink. They were affordable so I would purchase again in a different color.",4
B076ZHMR3S,"Spent new years at Universal Studios Hollywood with the family, we knew it was going to rain and I knew ponchos would be expensive inside the theme park. I got a pack of 5 because I was going with family I thought they were going to rip or something because they're like trash bags material but I was wrong. It was raining HARD for HOURS I was sitting on rides I sat to ate and I was carrying a heavy backpack and not even one rip on my poncho. I do recommend that if you know it's going to rain get some boots and waterproof pants that's just extra advice though the ponchos performed great!Update: it's still raining in California I got to work and I remembered that I still had the ponchos in my trunk. It's now been 2 days that I have been wearing them at work. I am a delivery driver so they gor abused but not even one rip still I HIGHLY recommend them",5
B076ZHMR3S,"Kept us pretty dry during a concert. Next time I'll get a reusable poncho because there were tighter like a tube as opposed to being a big sheet with a hole in the middle. Mildly constrictive, but dry nonetheless",5
B076ZHMR3S,Style & color,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Great value for the price , could use more than once",4
B076ZHMR3S,Ordered for forecasted rainy football game. Glad we had them.!! Worked very well.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"We always bring on every trip to Disney!  It's on our must have list.  packaging makes it great for throwing in a carry on, and they serve the need in those quick florida rain storms!",5
B076ZHMR3S,"Bought them for Disney World trip.  Used two of them during a quick shower.  Kept us dry, and we were able to save them for reuse at a later time.  They are not a heavy high end product, but lightweight and practical for keeping you dry if you get caught out in the rain.  Would buy again.",5
B076ZHMR3S,We took these on a trip to Europe  and they worked great.  Small and easy to pack.,5
B076ZHMR3S,"Exactly what I was looking for, very satisfied.",5
B076ZHMR3S,Re use these ponchos for thunderstorms.,5
B076ZHMR3S,I like the small package rather than carry a bulky rain coat,5
B076ZHMR3S,Very thin.  Gave as a gift,4
B09JFV7HHY,"We got this shirt to go with a suit for a semi-formal wedding.  We had looked at numerous shirts in dept stores that were $70 and up but the fabrics & cut weren't great.  The fabric on this shirt was thin enough to be comfortable but  not see through. The feel of the fabric is very smooth and nice to the touch.  The buttons were secure and well placed. My friend is tall with long arms & the sleeves were long enough.  The torso tucked in to his suit pants comfortably.  However, if you carry extra weight through the chest, abdomen or arms that could end up making things lay just a little short.  He just wore it last night so it remains to be seen how well it washes & wears over time but so far, great buy.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"Wanted the satiny finish for a slightly dressier look. Nice shirt for good price. Extra large slim is usually husband's best size but the regular large fit well, with trim fit.",5
B09JFV7HHY,"The fabric is soft and breathable, making them perfect for everyday wear. The fit is just right and they come in a variety of stylish colors and patterns. Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade their wardrobe!",5
B09JFV7HHY,I am pleased with this purchase. The shirt seems to be of great quality and fits comfortably.,5
B09JFV7HHY,"The color of the shirt is beautiful. It is not a true deep fuschia but it was close enough.My husband felt comfortable wearing the shirt and he looked great!We went by the measurements provided to determine his shirt size. We ordered a Large, however it was a little tight and the sleeves were a little short for him.He usually wears 17 1/2, 34/35 sleeve length.We are happy with the shirt. We ordered the burnt orange shirt in a X large this time.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"I'm 6'-1"" and this is a very well made shirt that is extremely comfortable.  My only complaint is that if I tuck it in I wish it were just a little bit longer.  It's fine, but the bottom button is just above my belt so it's a little short.  That said, wearing it untucked is perfect.  Also, I wear an XL tee shirt and XL in this shirt fits perfect, so the sizing is good.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"This is my second shirt from this company as I am quite pleased with the first. Arrives with creases that get ironed out after a quick cold water wash. Packed it in checked baggage and on arrival in humid Florida, it looked like it was just ironed, despite being inspected by TSA in a tight rollerbag. One could buy six of these for the price of one buttercloth brand that looks the same. Buying now before the Trump tarriffs kick in.",5
B09JFV7HHY,"Bought this shirt for my teen birthday and he absolutly loves it!! The material is so soft and comfy, and the fit is perfect. He's worn it to work and gotten tons of compliments. The wrinkle free thing is definetly true, I took it out of the package and hung it up and it looked great. It functions as it advertised, it doesnt shrink when in the dryer and the cut of the collar was sharp and measurements are accurate.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"This shirt was a complete surprise! Not only was it made very well, it was a great fit at my size. I usually have a 90% return rate because items are always smaller then they say. But this was a great buy for the money and the quality!",5
B09JFV7HHY,"Ok, so far so good!!! At first opening and try on in very impressed with the look and quality of this shirt!!! Looks much better in person than in the picture. Just a heads up though. It does have a Satin Shiny Silky type look and texture. And I'm very impressed with it!!! I will definitely be ordering a variety of colors to put in my closet. Definitely Recommend this shirt. They should offer a multi purchase discount though. This seller has(combo bundles),but I think it should also apply to quantity and colors. As their (bundles),only offer white or black. And I like a variety. Seems like a great value and quality for the price though. It comes pretty wrinkled, I'm starting out by washing it. Hopefully it will come out of the machine still looking impressive.",5
B09JFV7HHY,"Everyone is built different.  I'm 6ft and 240-250 and this fit okay, arms a bit longer than I'd like.  Unless you are ""fit"" or thin, it can be a challenge to find the right taylored fit in a dress shirt.  I figured the amount of stretch in this would help at the shoulders as i'm a bit broad up there.  It is, but the length of the arms bugged me a bit (better than too short though).  Shirt has a bit of a sheen which I'm ""tolerating"" as I'd rather it didn't but its more of an ""satin"" like paint is.  I don't have to wear these types of shirts often so right now I'm good.  If you wear dress shirts often, I'd keep looking.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"The shirts are comfortable and soft. The cut isn't like a name brand, but for the price I would recommend them.",4
B09JFV7HHY,Great shirt -My 15 year old wore this to his schooldance. It is stretchy and flexible with a silk feel to it. Washed very well and any wrinkles came out very easily with an iron on low setting.Highly recommend this shirt,5
B09JFV7HHY,I'm a pretty big guy and I have trouble finding shirts that fit. It is either tight around the shoulders or around my gut. This gives me plenty of room without feeling baggy. The shirt also feels like silk. I will certainly buy a couple more of these for work. The material feels really light so make sure you don't need something more durable.,5
B09JFV7HHY,Nice shirt unfortunately  the shirt is patterned too large around the middle. Will have to be tailored.,4
B09JFV7HHY,Omg this is far and away one of the most comfortable casual/dress shirts I have ever worn. As soon as I tried it on I was impressed. I will see how it holds up but definitely considering buying more.,5
B09JFV7HHY,Nice Shirt,4
B09JFV7HHY,Nice shirt,4
B09JFV7HHY,"Love everything about these shirts, except when using shirt stays. The shirt material is very thin and slick making it difficult for shirt stays to clamp on.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"I usually only purchase my dress shirts from Kohls.  That store couldn't seem to keep the dress shirt in the color that I wanted.  I went on Amazon and came across these shirts by J.VER's.  I like the high reviews and used the shirt size chart to be sure I'm ordering my correct size.  The shirts were on sale at $19.00 each, I ordered myself two of them in burgundy color.  The shirt arrived very well packed and I love the silk-like texture.  They both fit very well.  I plan on ordering another two shirts in grey and tan colors.",5
B09JFV7HHY,Beautiful shirt. The extra large was just a little bit too tight. Nice material. Buttons look nice against the blue,5
B09JFV7HHY,"I bought for my husband to wear to a wedding. Size XL fit him great and he said it was really comfortable! Only issue is he hugged someone at the wedding and their bracelet snagged his shirt in the chest. You can totally tell too, so he has only worn it the one time. Price was perfect though. This will probably be a holiday's shirt now so the tare doesn't matter.",4
B09JFV7HHY,These do run a bit bigger but super comfy but size down,5
B09JFV7HHY,Very good quality and super soft. True to size. I will be ordering more colors soon.,5
B09JFV7HHY,It fit very nice,5
B09JFV7HHY,"Had a weird smell out of the packaging but I hit it with some Febreze and it'll be okay in the closet until I go to the dry cleaners. Fits well for 3X almost perfect, wish they had a 3X-Long but I have a long torso and short legs. I think if I went up to a 4X the arms and chest probably wouldn't fit as good. Length of sleeves is about as perfect as I've ever gotten in a button up so I'm going to keep the 3X and not worry about sending it back. Will update with a picture if I remember.*Edit for photoI've lost about 30lbs since ordering this and the longer length isn't as needed since my gut is a bit smaller, will need to order a new one when I lose more weight.",5
B09JFV7HHY,"I bough this nice shirt for my boyfriend for Christmas, I like it because the quality, style and the material is really soft. Good value for the money. He liked it a lot!",5
B09JFV7HHY,True to size. My son is 6'0 and 185 pounds and ordered the Large Tall. Very good quality!,5
B09JFV7HHY,Buena calidad,5
B09JFV7HHY,Perfect!,5
B09JFV7HHY,"Pretty nice shirt for the price tbh. Collar is thicker than most, and the size is true to fit. However, some form of ironing or steaming is heavily recommended to get rid of the harsh, thick creases.",5
B09JFV7HHY,"All parts of this shirt fits well, comfortable and soft!",5
B09JFV7HHY,"My friend loved the shirt, it fit him very well!",5
B09JFV7HHY,Very good material,5
B09JFV7HHY,Muy buena calidad,5
B09JFV7HHY,Good quality shirt,5
B09JFV7HHY,CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR ADULT  QUALITY GOOD SIZE WAS GOOD TO FIT,4
B09JFV7HHY,Man it's a nice looking shirt!,5
B09JFV7HHY,These men's shirts are silky and are made of a quality material.  They look sharp and come in a variety of bright colors.  They are nicely priced and I even got 5 of them on Black Friday so that made the price even nicer.,5
B09JFV7HHY,"The shirt is thinner than expected. You can see through it, but it's not too obvious. You'll have to make some adjustments to get a perfect fit. I bought a large one. I'm 6ft, 200lb, and have a muscular build. The reason for 4 is that it's kind of short.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"It feels really silky...but, I washed it  and dried it and still shows the marks  how it was folded and a trace of wrinkles.",4
B09JFV7HHY,I like rhe material feel..alil stretchy. Fits snug. I got a large tall and fits correctly. Happy with purchase will be buying more in different colors.,5
B09JFV7HHY,As expected,5

B09JFV7HHY,"Very soft shirt, quality is OK.",4
B09JFV7HHY,Just like the picture,5
B09JFV7HHY,"Shirt is quite comfortable..was initially hesitant, due to sizing. Ordered XXL..fits ok.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"It is accurate, wrinkle free shirt.Waist is pretty short. I wish they had tall-size.Not bad.",4
B09JFV7HHY,Dislike not being able to button up the top button on my 3xl Otherwise I love the shirt.,4
B09JFV7HHY,I rinsed and dried on delicate before wearing. I did have to lightly iron a few wrinkles. Would purchase again.,4
B09JFV7HHY,"This is a very nice shirt, wearable,  value for the money. Fits turn to size.",5
B09JFV7HHY,Fit perfectly,5

B09JFV7HHY,Right out of the bag I felt that it was my style. It feel smooth I like that silk smooth feeling. I'm going to order 10 of these. Once a week. This is all I want to ware. I just wished it had a pocket. I'm a Magician. :),5
B09JFV7HHY,"The shirt was excellent, fit well and was very comfortable, although it was not folded correctly and was very wrinkled and took a lot extra steaming to get them out.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"Fast service, high quality products.",5
B09JFV7HHY,"Nice shirt, fits well. Was surprised at how shiny it is, but works well under a sweater for my purposes.",4
B09JFV7HHY,"Fits good, looks great, no breast pocket, fits to size",4
B09JFV7HHY,"True to size, held up well after multiple uses.",5
B09JFV7HHY,Nice shirt. It's very sheen and tux oriented. I would not wear it by itself as a button up. I'd feel too self conscience about the sheen of it. I just should of read more details/reviews on it. It is a very nice shirt though.,5
B09JFV7HHY,Feel amazing needed quickly for family pictures.,5
B09JFV7HHY,"Easy to iron, very comfortable, and pretty",5
B0058Z33L0,Great fit and awesome quality. They're not too thick but not thin either. Very comfortable and look awesome!,5
B0058Z33L0,These are well made and has an accurate sizing.  Delivery was fast.,5
B0058Z33L0,Good quality socks. In socks for teens.,5
B0058Z33L0,My granddaughter wanted Nike socks for Christmas. I had to guess so which style. She said these were the prefect height for her.  I know Nike socks hold up well.,5
B0058Z33L0,Bought as a gift. Grand daughterSaid they are just what she wanted. She plays lots of sports.,5
B0058Z33L0,"Nike is my granddaughters favorite brand for socks. She likes this height of sock and they were part of her Christmas present this year. She wore them that day. It's hard to please a 13 year old, they live in a tough world.",5

B0058Z33L0,Fit great,4
B0058Z33L0,All the teens love these! So comfortable!,5

B0058Z33L0,"Very comfortable, thickness of the sock is great. Versatility is great for gym and casual wear! Perfect height length",4
B0058Z33L0,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Socks are true to size. They have a thickness in the toe and heal area, a ribbed texture in the arch area, and seem to be made of quality material. Only time will tell how they wear.",5
B0058Z33L0,My 11 year old is very picky with her socks and she loves these!,5
B0058Z33L0,"I usually wear cheap socks, the kinds of ones you buy from walmart. I recently moved and most of my socks ended up losing their partner, or just flat out disappeared. These socks are so comfortable! They don't ""water-log"" like the cheap socks would after working all day. One star off for durability as I have noticed the nike logo begin to fray from the sock. No holes have appeared from that issue though.",5
B0058Z33L0,Good buy. Very soft and comfortable.,5
B0058Z33L0,My grandkids love them. Great fitting and comfortable.,5
B0058Z33L0,Good quality,5

B0058Z33L0,Great,5
B0058Z33L0,Daughter loved them,5
B0058Z33L0,Perfect and comfortable fit,5
B0058Z33L0,"Soft, comfortable, high enough but not too high.. can't go wrong",5
B0058Z33L0,My daughter loves them although they could be softer.,4
B0058Z33L0,Best socks ever.  Thin and sturdy,5
B0058Z33L0,The socks are nice but they are expensive. The quality of the socks seem fine as well as durable.,4
B0058Z33L0,"these socks are not 43/45, looks more like 40/42 but whatever",4
B0058Z33L0,Very comfortable and cute. Great for sports!,5
B0058Z33L0,"My niece loves it, but I got it for me. I ordered a size 4~5 but they come for babies",5
B0058Z33L0,My daughter has been dying for these but was disappointed at how low they go.,3
B0058Z33L0,Performs well,4
B0058Z33L0,Socks are thick great qualityComfortableGood price,5
B0058Z33L0,"Comfortable, soft socks!  No holes in the toes after wearing them many many times and many washes",5
B0058Z33L0,I was expecting better quality but these socks are so thin. The first pair I wore formed a hole after one day of wear.,1
B0058Z33L0,These Nike socks are just as advertised. The size and quality are perfect,5
B0058Z33L0,"So Nike has the regular NON dri-fit materal socks, and then the newer dri-fit materal. I did not see anything in the description about this being dri-fit and the stock photo did NOT show dri-fit. I did NOT want the dri-fit ones because I noticed the durability is much worse. You wear these socks and wash them a few times the the material around the heel is pretty much all gone if not in other areas as well. To much a pain to return these since I used Gift cards.If you want Nike dri-fit socks that have minimal durability then these would be for you.",2
B0058Z33L0,Exactly what we needed for back to school,5
B0058Z33L0,Liked the fact that the delivery was on time. Used for golf socks.,5
B0058Z33L0,My teen daughter loves these!,5
B0058Z33L0,i recently bought the same socks from Nike this one has thinner fabric so i guess this is just an imitation. the original has also the word dri-fit stamped at the toe.,3
B0058Z33L0,My son loves them!,5
B0058Z33L0,These are very thin Nike socks not much cushion or padding at all just a basic pair of socks really dry fit are lot more comfortable and thicker would think they would last longer,4
B0058Z33L0,Will be buying these again! Great socks.,5
B0058Z33L0,Comfort ok but durability sucks!  Have holes in 1/2 of my socks that I bought just 5 months ago!  Only wear each  one  about 12 times over that period!!,3
B0058Z33L0,As described.,5
B0058Z33L0,"Needed dark socks to hide the fact that I walk a lot,  through tall grass, dirt,  etc.  Needed socks that were comfortable,  a good fit and with some cushioning as well. I usually purchase C9 socks but my decision to purchase Nike was a great choice.  The Nike socks but every point that I was needing my socks to meet.  Good value for my money!!",5
B0058Z33L0,"I don't know if these are authentic.  They are quite thin, like the dri fit models, but they dont say dri fit. The performance cushion socks I bought in the past were much thicker and softer. I can feel the knit pattern on my skin. Too bad all the stores are closed because I cant guarantee I'm getting real nike products unless I go directly to foot locker.",3
B0058Z33L0,If your walking around in these at your house these socks tend to pick up things such as hair lint so there will be a bunch stuff on your socks,4
B0058Z33L0,"Low ankle socks, easy on, easy off......",5
B0058Z33L0,I wurk 18 hours and needed something between my feet and flip flops.,5
B0058Z33L0,I love these. I tapped buy again and 2 packages came too large.I am size 8. First package size perfect. I am going to buy again. I returned The packages of socks. I should get refund but could also have $ go to 2 new pkgs I'm ordering now if I can say size. Thank you,5
B0058Z33L0,Real deal Nike.,5
B0058Z33L0,"I ordered the black and the white ankle socks. I white socks were definitely ankle length, but the black socks were lowcut.",1
B0058Z33L0,Good,5
B0058Z33L0,Great,5
B0058Z33L0,The top of the socks will thread out if you pull them on to hard.  Made a.little cheap.,4
B0058Z33L0,The socks were not as well cushioned or thick as I expected.  Okay but not great.  Probably will order something different next time.,4
B0058Z33L0,Bought these as a gift they are the only socks he will wear,5
B0058Z33L0,fast delivery and in great  condition,5
B0058Z33L0,This is just what I expected. Not to thick and comfortable.,4
B0058Z33L0,"These are really good sport socks with extra ""ribs"" on the soles that provide a bit of support and cushion.  These are the real deal and not ""knock-offs"".  I have had for some time and they wear very well for those who are a bit hard on their feet.  Will definitely purchase again!",5
B0058Z33L0,Purchased same socks in a store and they were smaller.  But they still did the job,4
B0058Z33L0,Great quality low price.,4
B0058Z33L0,over priced but they are nice,4
B0058Z33L0,Could be thicker don't believe these are true nike,3
B0058Z33L0,This was my first purchase of a Nike product and I'm very pleased. The socks are so comfy I barely know I have them on and the quality is terrific.,5
B0058Z33L0,"I wore these socks twice and washed them three times, and they are falling apart.",2
B0058Z33L0,"Mine arrived with the back part of one show eaten away by rats or something. The box was fine but one shoe inside and the paper around it were chewed on.The one shoe I did try on (before seeing the damage on the other) was dangerous on my tile floor; so slippery, no traction.  I would only recommend these shoes for one-time use at best that requires no walking, or I'd expect to need crutches if you move too quickly.  Obviously cheap any pressed out of some chinese plastic-injection molding machine. As cheap as they are, they're still way over-priced.  Only regret I didn't get a pic of the rat damage before returning...Peace, Fellow Amazonians, happy huntingHappy 2019",1
B0058Z33L0,Seem to be good stocks of course if nicks then probley be better than mostCon the tps are tighter than I thought gg,5
B0058Z33L0,Great socks for the price,4
B0058Z33L0,Great socks! !! The price is a little bit expensive but still it's really good socks,4
B07JDFPQTC,"These are really great quality t-shirts - the best I've yet been able to find on Amazon that were reasonably priced. I've had them over a year now and they are still holding up incredibly well. They are soft, comfortable, and fit very well. I can wear them with just a pair of jeans and they look great. The material is thick and durable, and after a year of washes not a single thread has come apart or any damage to the fabric noticed. Superb shirts - I will be buying these again in the future if and when these eventually need to be replaced.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"Idk what I did but they started having holes on the stomach area of them. Other than that they're good quality. They're lightweight, fit well, and are pretty comfortable for running around a store in for 7-10 hours average at a time. The material isn't thick but doesn't feel thin. Neckline is nice. Good for being comfortable at a decent price.",4
B07JDFPQTC,"I bought these in a few colors and sizes. The color selection was great. They wash up well, had no noticeable shrinkage and are very soft. They are light weight so great for layering. Purchased an XL and are true to size.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"Fit well, and feel sturdy and well made. These should last a few years definitely.Love the subtle color of these, will buy more in the future when I need new shirts. The material feels light and breathable.",5
B07JDFPQTC,My son needed several black T-shirts to wear under his uniform for his Culinary Arts course. These shirts are of very good quality. They fit nicely and are very comfortable. The black color seems to hold up well with being washed. I am very pleased with the purchase.,5
B07JDFPQTC,the shirts are great for the price for about 3 dollars a shirt that is just crazy they cost a tiny bit more than the white ones but it is worth it for sure they look great feel great they will shrink like 1% to 5%when you first wash them so just be sure to get large if your bigger I got medium though but I am losing weight though lol it would have not fit me if i was still fatso just be aware of that and don't lie to your self,5
B07JDFPQTC,"I love my white shirts.  I've bought these 3 times now (first to try them out, second time was to replace my remaining old white shirts, 3rd time was because a few of them started to shrink after a year).  My Hanes white shirts that I bought from Wal-Mart were getting old and discolored and I needed to find a replacement and I was getting sick of buying things from Wal-Mart and being disappointed.  These are thicker than the Hanes.  I guess that's about it.  But I'll probably buy some more in the future.I will say after a while some of the shirts start to shrink.  Not all of them, but like 1 or 2 out of a pack will shrink while the rest stay roughly the same size.",4
B07JDFPQTC,"For the price, these tee shirts get 5 stars.  They're well-made, they don't have an annoying tag that will scratch against your neck, and the sizing is perfect.  They're also not too thin nor too thick and the color is a nice white.  Very comfortable white tee shirts to wear under your other shirts.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"I'm 6'4 215lbs w a long torso, so finding tees that are long, but not in the Big & Tall sec is always an issue. I love the length, perfect fit on the shoulders, awesome feel and surprising quality. In the past have been buying the more expensive tees for $35 each, not again.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"Soft textured,good quality fabric smooth to the skin,and basically  a bargain for the amount of shirts it included and the price.The fact that it came with Multicolored  shirts, and you can wear these in so many ways is top priority for every day life. The comfort level is at another level.Well definitely buy again.Arrived quick straight to my door just in time for this cold weather,I also recommend wearing this shirt under another shirt feels just about right for this cold winter.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"Ok so  first off I'm female and yes I know these are men's t-shirts.  Here is why I  like this brand and why I buy these.  I work in a factory.  it's hard work and clothes get ruined.  I buy over sized men t shirts because they are comfortable.  I buy always black because dirt does not show up if I need to stop by a store after work.  Love the fact I could find all black in the size I wanted and a set of 5 shirts in one package!  Great find and I hope the seller continues to sell these, as I will recommend and purchases myself in the future.",5
B07JDFPQTC,I received my shirts today and tried them on the fit was perfect comfortable and shirts look to be very well-made. Will be buying more in the future for sure.,5
B07JDFPQTC,"Comfortable fit, the material is not scratchy and the colors are great. I was disappointed in the quality as one of the tshirts had a hole in it, I have bought these tshirts before and did not have an issue, hope that this is a one off occurrence.",4
B07JDFPQTC,"They fit me more like an XL than an L. I'm curious if it's to prevent shrinking into an M over time. I use them for work undershirts and around the house. They are well made, thicker than other brands. They are on the rough feel side when you first get them and washing does eliminate that.",4
B07JDFPQTC,"My 16 year old grandson said he wanted black pocket less tee shirts for Christmas. I saw these and read the reviews. I also researched the brand. Very good. As they, no news is good news. Neither he nor my dauIghter have asked to have them returned so I'm taking it as a win! From what I saw, the material is excellent. I assume the fit is great and true to size.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"Nice, price. GREAT quality, Cotton. Nice, seems. Colors,are great, fit, everyday. As a undershirt, or day shirt. These are great. Good, QUALITY.",5
B07JDFPQTC,Shirts are true to fit. Only recommendation would be not to dry them in the dryer and let them air dry; they will shrink.,4

B07JDFPQTC,Perfect gift he still wears these nice quality and perfectly sized tops till this day!,5
B07JDFPQTC,Great for making designs on the shirt,5
B07JDFPQTC,For the money these seem like a deal. I've bought all the cheap brands through the years and these are quality in that group. I use them for house shirts. But they run big and even after washing and drying on the hottest setting and still I was swimming in them still. I have autism and need tight fitting clothes for sensory input. Medium would probably be too small. Still a good shirt.,4
B07JDFPQTC,Shirts are good quality and affordable,5
B07JDFPQTC,"These are excellent undershirts, that are made with such durable quality that they can even be worn on their own. I love the color combinations, it really enhances the look of the undershirts rather than the standard white tees.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"I am 5ft 8 and about 180-190lb, I ordered large size, fit very well.",5
B07JDFPQTC,Love this brand will buy again,5
B07JDFPQTC,"Sure. It's a little thin, but they do fit good. They won't last.",5
B07JDFPQTC,"I always wear a white t-shirt under my L.L. Bean, oxford cotton button downs.  This t-shirt is the best weight, best fit, and best price, hands-down.",5
B07JDFPQTC,the feel was really great and the material was soft. go get yours.,5
B07VF6N878,"I mean socks are socks, these meet the bill of goods.The height is just above the ankle.Not terribly thick, but they work for daily wear. I'd expect to replace these  within the next 12 to 18 months. My last set lasted 6 months. So these are good quality.Maybe I'm too rough on socks, but man's got to work to love these days.Haven't slipped in these socks so far.Thin, not super warm.Strechiness is fine, they snug up nicely.",5
B07VF6N878,"They are a tight fit, but overall a good value for the money.",4
B07VF6N878,"These socks are great, they fit well and are comfortable. I got them mainly due to cost and so far they're worth it.Overall they're great everyday socks especially considering the price and quantity.",5
B07VF6N878,"These socks are great. They fit perfect on my big feet, i wear 10 in women's 8.5 men's, they're soft & stretchy. Even as my legs swell through the day these are not cutting off my circulation & the ankle height is perfect for my work boots. They look sharp, mostly solid black, they also don't roll down & feel like their actually durable. We'll see as time goes on but i feel like i won't wear holes into these like i do with the thinner socks.",5
B07VF6N878,These are my favorite socks! So comfy and last a long time.,5
B07VF6N878,Quality is great comfort is there They keep my feet warm and fit perfectly.,5
B07VF6N878,Loves these! Very comfortable. I use them for work and for home.,5
B07VF6N878,As a size 12 I've always had issues with 6-12 socks as they need wild amounts of stretching and are typically uncomfortable.  These are great and have had no issues fitting.,5
B07VF6N878,The only socks I will purchase!,5
B07VF6N878,Good product,5
B07VF6N878,excelente,4
B07VF6N878,Held up well even with a 12 year old being rough.  Fit him perfectly.,5
B07VF6N878,They feel great fit great and great material,5
B07VF6N878,Nice fabric.,4
B07VF6N878,Husband is a size 14 wide so I was scared they be too small but they fit him very well. Not too tight around the ankle or toes.,5
B07VF6N878,"Perfect fit, definitely comfortable",5
B07VF6N878,I was afraid but no more,5
B07VF6N878,Six socks that don't suck.,5
B07VF6N878,Stays up and comfortable,5
B07VF6N878,worked as advertised,5
B07VF6N878,.,5
B07VF6N878,They fit well and and are very comfortable.,5
B07VF6N878,"They're quite comfy, but the quality is very poor. They started having bear threads and I had to start throwing them away after just 6 or 7 times of use.",3
B07VF6N878,Great ankle sock for walking,5
B07VF6N878,I get these for my husband every year!,5
B07VF6N878,Only had them for 6 months and they're already getting holes in them.  A shame because otherwise they are great socks.,3
B07VF6N878,"These socks fit well. They are breathable, and wash well",5
B07VF6N878,Very comfortable. High quality. Bought the big bag since I sometimes go thru them quickly.,5
B07VF6N878,Just as described,4
B07VF6N878,"Not exactly as thick as the double priced competition but if you go through socks like my feet/boot do, these are the way to go.",4
B07VF6N878,"Got these for my dad since it had been a while since he had bought socks and a good amount of his socks started to get holes, so I think I was time to get him new socks. He was wearing high socks and would fold them down towards ankle. I bought these thinking they would be the same height as the ones he has but they are shorter and go up to the ankle. He likes them, said they were not too tight, they are soft, and breathable for him. Thumbs up from him. And he was happy when I told him how many socks I bought for the price. Anything is better than the socks he had but, he is a picky person so I am glad they worked for him.",5
B07VF6N878,Thin socks - was expecting them to be more plush but it was still a good deal for how many were in the pack.,4
B07VF6N878,"I like these socks because they are not too tight on my feet. And they are not too long.I wear an ankle brace on one foot, and these fit perfectly. The only thing is dislike is that they are not 100 percent cotton. But I can't find anything better.",4
B07VF6N878,"I wear a men's 10.5, and the socks, while stretchy, could be larger. Wish I'd bought the 12+ instead of the 6-12. These work, but they're on the smaller side.",4
B07VF6N878,Quality is good on them and they are very breathable. Holding up good after several washes and workdays,5
B07VF6N878,These run just a little big. Overall they are nice & thin & I do like them.,4
B07VF6N878,Good quality.,4
B07VF6N878,Just what I needed.,5
B07VF6N878,Comfortable and look good.,4
B07VF6N878,"Comfortable, thin for exercising so well suited to the warmer half of the year. Cut goes above the ankle but not too high which is exactly what I was looking for.",5
B07VF6N878,"Not bad. I just got a hole I 1 sock ( not sure if that was done by me or quality of the product, hence the 4 star) but these are not bad.",4
B07VF6N878,They have these listed for size 6 to 12... For me I am at a size 6... They do not work for me as it leaves about 3 to 4 inches of extra sock when I put them on.. Need more mid sizes as 1 size does not fit all.,4
B07VF6N878,Bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says the fit is great and loves how soft they feel. The quality is great as he works a tough job and they really do last awhile.,5
B07VF6N878,the size 12 fits my big ole feet just perfect. I wear a size 13 and its not to tight like some of the other knock offs.,5
B07VF6N878,Muy buena calidad,5
B07VF6N878,All of my socks wind up getting torn up we'll see how long this lasts but these feel very good,5
B07VF6N878,"I bought these almost 2 years ago in December of 2022 and all except one pair are hole-free and still good. Other brands like the Dickies, didn't last a year.",5
B07VF6N878,"Very comfortable, and durable",5
B07VF6N878,I like them,5
B07VF6N878,"I like these socks, they're comfortable and they fit well. Only problem is they get holes in them very easily but other than that they're solid.",4
B07VF6N878,nice comfy socks,5
B07VF6N878,"If you're in need of some socks that cover your feet, then these are the socks for you.  I get a pack of these every year and they start to get holy towards the end of the year and then I start the process over again.  They don't cost that much so I do not expect that much.  A year works for me!",4
B07VF6N878,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These socks are a good fit.come in  different colors good height. Moisture control. Stability. and material. is also nice. They were around $12 Which is a good value.  but currently went up to $24 Which is a little overpraised. I would say give them a try if they drop back down to twelve to save some money. Also makes a good gift Can never have enough socks.,5
B07VF6N878,Runs small,4
B07VF6N878,These socks are awesome wonderful price,5
B07VF6N878,Had these for a while and there last the longest.,5
B07VF6N878,"They are a little thinner , not padded for walking or running long distance.",4
B07VF6N878,Good socks seem to be holding up OK,4
B07VF6N878,They got here fast n they fit great n very comfortable as expected.,5
B07VF6N878,The socks were as advertised and packaged well.,5
B07VF6N878,Not bad quality,3
B07VF6N878,"Cheap, and comfortable.",5
B07VF6N878,"These socks are very comfortable, durable and fit great. I will definitely buy them again.",5
B07VF6N878,For the price these are great. Not too thick not too thick. Exactly what I was looking for. We will see how they hold up in the wash.,5
B07VF6N878,"I got these to wear at work since wearing my long socks with shorts looked funny to me. They're very thick and comfortable, and they feel nice and durable and should last me quite a while at my job where I'm on my feet for most of the work day.",5
B07VF6N878,You know the amazing feeling of putting on a brand new pair of socks?  How comfortable they are the cushion the freshness.  These don't give you that feeling.  I buy many pairs of socks at a time all the same style and color to make laundry easier.  I expect them to last me years before I replace them all and start over again.  Less than a year with these and I want to throw them all away.  I would not buy again.,2
B07VF6N878,"I first impression was that I had made a mistake buying these because the polyester material seems sheer and slippery when walking on ceramic tile flooring. I decided to keep them and skip the return process and to my surprise, the more I wore them the more I liked them. Unlike most socks , it takes very minimal effort to slip them on and they will not sag on you as the day wears on.",4
B07VF6N878,"I got these after trying a different brand that was highly rated.  Compared to those, these are much more comfortable, a better fit, and appear to be much more durable.  As long as they hold up over time, I'm 100% satisfied with this purchase.",5
B07VF6N878,Love the price and convenience of shipping to my home.,5
B07VF6N878,I think these socks are very comfortable. My feet can breathe and these socks fit my size 14 feet.,5
B07VF6N878,Nice,5
B07VF6N878,Great quality socks at a fair price!,5
B07VF6N878,Got tired of buying kids socks for the teens and teens and adults. So got a bunch of these for the whole family. Works great,5
B07VF6N878,Fit great! Comfy!,5
B07VF6N878,They're socks. You get exactly what you'd expect. Comfort and nice fit.,5
B07VF6N878,They last a good while until you start getting a while at the heel; but for the price and quantity...very good.,5
B07VF6N878,"My husband needed new socks for work. He opened them and was like, ""I really needed these"". I said I know. Then he asked hiw much did they cost me. Not much but I'm not. Gonna tell him..lol packed great, look like I just took off the processing belt at the warehouse ( new &fresh).",5
B07VF6N878,Like them,4
B07VF6N878,Provide lot of warm not for tropical countries or areas,3
B07VF6N878,My size 11 feet fit good in these socks and they are comfy. The socks stay up and are not too thick for summer wear. Just enough sock sticking out of the shoe to give you some ankle padding but low enough to be cool for summer.,5
B07VF6N878,its comportable to my feet,5
B07VF6N878,Comfortable for everyday wear,5
B07VF6N878,I needed sock for a road trip to wash out in a sink. So I got these Fruit of the Loom Dual Defense Ankle Socks  because they were cheap - what a surprise. The socks were very nice.  Only problem is how the plastic security thread - in the process of removing it one pair of socks were damaged. There were several plastic threads!! What a pain - but the price was,5
B07VF6N878,"I got tired of running out of socks, so I ordered these. They are very comfortable and just what I needed. Very soft and fits great.",5
B07VF6N878,"Estoy escribiendo este review despies de mucho tiempo de estar usando la medias y estan en muy buen estado, recomendadisimas.",5
B07VF6N878,These are not like men's socks feel. These are tight n thin. Disappointed,3
B0874WHB28,"The weather has just started to turn and has been extremely cold but the times I have used them they work great.  They dont feel resistant and do a good job of adding warmth.  They allow me to run with a lighter jogging pant, so far.  Will purchase more.",5
B0874WHB28,Love Under Armour products. Bought this for my husband. It was a great fit. True to size. He loves how comfortable they are and plans to use them to layer for the winter.,5
B0874WHB28,"these are amazing, both for the lightness while running, which i use them for, but you can fit them in the palm of your hand. which is why when packing them to go running on a trip, somehow they are so light, they somehow got lost and i never found them again. so i had to get them again because they are the best running tights for cold weather i've ever had at any price. not only do they virtually feel like you don't have them on while running, they kill the cold for down to at least 38 degrees Fahrenheit. possibly colder, but 38 degrees is the lowest i've run with them without any cold discomfort. they aren't 'warming', but rather negate the cold. when i'm running i don't need warming leggings, which are way thicker and ruin a run, but rather something that knocks out the cold is perfect as body temp goes up when you exercise. the only thing i must remember is to pay attention when packing for a trip next time as these are so light they'll blow right out of your suitcase.",5
B0874WHB28,"Under Armour tights, just like the ones you know.  No issues, good quality, fits as expected.",5
B0874WHB28,These leggings are Skin tight. I guess I should have noticed that when I purchased them. I look silly! I have purchased other leggings that fit like sweat pants. I only use them in the early morning (5 AM) when my pup needs to go out and I am not fearful that my neighbors might see me.,4
B0874WHB28,Husband loves them and they are very warm. Wash well.,5
B0874WHB28,"My husband loves them, great fit for under his shorts when working out.",5
B0874WHB28,phone pocket is handy,5
B0874WHB28,I use these for hunting as a base layer for weather in the teens.  They keep my prized possessions warm.,5
B0874WHB28,how did I live without these before? perfection,5
B0874WHB28,I use them for mountain biking and the leggings keep me warm,5
B0874WHB28,The seam on the right has ripped all the way up the inside of the leg.,3
B0874WHB28,"After inquiring @ the Y with men wearing supportive leggings for their workouts, I decided to try them. Not only do they help w/circulation and keeping your muscles warm (like a heating pad on low), they are so  comfortable!Wouldn't think of wearing over underwear. I will get another pair just for the colder weather to keep my legs warm, as I live in gym shorts.",5
B0874WHB28,I think I look so cool in my short shorts and black leggings on leg day.,5
B0874WHB28,"Has a pocket for a phone or keys. Fits well and is great for working out, running, or playing pickle ball on chilly mornings.",5
B0874WHB28,They fit very nicely and worked well in the water,5
B0874WHB28,,3
B0874WHB28,"I wore Empire paintball knee pads over these for airsoft today, my knees have never been so dry! Great product by Under Armour. Originally purchased to wear shorts over in the desert, now I'm utilizing them for any athletic purpose. Very happy customer here, thank you!",5
B0874WHB28,"Perfect for the cool morning walks when it's a little too chilly for me to wear shorts! Normally I wear an XL with the heavier tights but went with a large on these and they fit perfect. Snug and form fitting which is how I like them but not uncomfortable and they don't bunch up behind the knees.One thing I will point out, and I saw questions about this. The material is light and can become a little ""sheer"" when stretched out. Included a couple of pictures with my knees bent, but there is an extra panel in the crotch so nothing to worry about there. I'll see how they hold up and report back, I'll probably but another pair.Edit: Just bought another pair, looks like the price dropped some so I took advantage of it!",5
B0874WHB28,My son loves these and wears them under his soccer uniform.  Highly recommend and they hold up reasonably well to all the diving.,5
B0874WHB28,Got these for my son to wear under his practice clothes on cold days. He says they are comfortable and true to size.,5
B0874WHB28,Get well,5
B0874WHB28,I love it wow the quality is absolutely beautiful,5
B0874WHB28,Kept my son warm in North Dakota,5
B0874WHB28,Great for sport,5
B0874WHB28,"I owned a pair of Under Armour leggings from 10-15 years ago and they were amazing in all around weather (including very low temps). After some eventual tearing around the bottoms I decided on buying a new pair. I bought the WarmGear and ColdGear pairs. The ColdGear is amazing, and keeps my legs SUPER warm outside (including in the recent -2F temps), yet isn't hot while inside the gym. I highly recommend these. The WarmGear is equally as impressive but definitely cooler in cold temps than the ColdGear.Fit wise, I didn't want any bagginess. They needed to be snug. At 5'11"", the Large was the perfect length, and tightness. They were both a little baggy around my ankles, but after the first wash they were perfect!",5
B0874WHB28,I clearly ordered BLACK but was sent NAVY BLUE...but they are still good quality just doesn't match the shirt that was purchased to go with it!,4
B0874WHB28,terrible fabric quality. definitely not a thermal wear.,2
B0874WHB28,"I just recently got into running as a hobby. I was so scared of the cold weather because I didn't think I could run in it, especially with this recent nationwide cold snap. I also did not want to run in pants or in heavy gear, the lack of gear is what makes running alluring to me in fact. This product was a great lightweight alternative to running pants or wearing other implements while running.This product somehow kept my legs way warmer than I expected, are lightweight, and are not too tight in any of the wrong places. I see myself buying more if I have to do a lot of cold weather running.",5
B0874WHB28,"I have purchased many pairs of these from UA, but the last purchase was several years ago.  This new pair has a new cut which I really like. These now have more room in the front and are designed better for men, if you get my drift.  That is the good part, but I'm not sold on the new material.  It fits and feels great, but it doesn't stretch and conform to my movements as well as the old material did. I've only tried them one time so far. I would buy them again even though they may not be ""as good"" as the old model.",4
B0874WHB28,I bought a couple pairs of these to wear as a lightweight base layer for cool weather in early fall and mid spring and they did not disappoint. They work very well at keeping me warm in cool temps with being hot as the days warm up around midday. The quality is exactly what I've come to expect from Under Armour which is why I keep coming back.,5
B0874WHB28,I use these under my jeans while riding my motorcycle in cooler weather. They work well.,5
B0874WHB28,My son needed a layer to wear under his football pants.  These pants protected his legs when playing on artificial turf (from turf burns) and also provided a layer for the cold games.  My son prefers these because there are no angular seams going down the legs and this made for a cleaner look.,5
B0874WHB28,Much needed for morning jogs. Always buy brand name for comfort.,5
B0874WHB28,Haven't worn for long yet...just for a test fit...fits fine...will update if need to,4
B0874WHB28,It does what it says it does. It will keep you warm.,5
B0874WHB28,"I use them for work, they are very stretchy",4
B0874WHB28,"I'm fair skinned, my legs are tattooed, I travel a lot, and it tends to draw all kinds of attention. I wanted something I could wear, to coverup my legs, but remain cool in warm climates. I don't know how these work, but, it is very impressive. Just putting them on made me feel cooler (temperture-wise) with the added bonus of reduced sun exposure. It all sounded too good to be true, but, there it is. I'm a fan and i'm impressed.",5
B0874WHB28,Functional serves its purpose,4
B0874WHB28,"When it's cold out and you exercise, play sports or work. These are what you need. These are the best base layers there are.",5
B0874WHB28,"Used for soccer, better quality than expected",4
B0874WHB28,The Under Armour Men's Heat Gear Leggings were a perfect Christmas gift for my college baseball player grandson. He loved them. Great quality and fit.,5
B0874WHB28,nice but to tight for large.,3
B0874WHB28,Bought for a base layer under my snowboarding gear. Works good,5
B0874WHB28,Received as described. Great for under workout shirtsComfortable,5
B0874WHB28,Buen producto buena calidad de material,5
B0874WHB28,I bought these for the cold Missouri winter as a base layer and they work so well. My lower body stayed warm even though I was outside for several hours. They fit like a dream. No pulling or bunching up. Very happy with the purchase.,5
B0874WHB28,Winter wearGreat qualityTrue to size fitting,5
B0874WHB28,Works great,4
B0874WHB28,"Bought these to wear under jiu jitsu shorts. I'm 6'0"" and large fit perfect. Not as sheer as the nike combat leggings I had previously but not really warmer either due to ventilation panels. Also more anatomically designed the the nikes.",5
B0874WHB28,Nice,5
B0874WHB28,"I tried cheaper brands forever, but these are great and worth the money. I bought 2 more after the first pair. They're comfortable (more cotton-like than nylon-like), I don't sweat a ton in them, and they have a little pocket I didn't see for a few weeks so you can actually carry stuff around.",5
B0874WHB28,Wicks well too,5
B0874WHB28,This undergarment has been poorly designed. The seams are bulky and one of them is located where it harms the crotch even very early during the ride.,1
B0874WHB28,"Excellent item for every wear , is comfortable",5
B0874WHB28,These are great!,5
B0874WHB28,"You really get what you pay for. These Under Armor leggings really offer compression and are much thicker than their less expensive competitors (especially in the crotchal area). I'm 6'4"", 225 lb with a 34"" waist and the Large fit me perfectly. Could probably wear these Under Armor without shorts if I'm cycling and be okay modesty-wise; I wouldn't dare wear either of the knockoff brands I have without shorts.",5
B0874WHB28,"They are perfect and the fit is perfect as well. another thing that separates them from others is that you can get them over your feet without damaging the opening. This is obviously a ""quality thing"" because I have had problems with other Brands.",5
B0874WHB28,not good if you want to stay warm outside in cold weather. i put them in the house and my legs got cold when i moved.,1
B0874WHB28,"Super warm and comfortable, best worn with gym shorts as is standard for men.  Very soft and form fitting,  Great for sports or just a warm base layer,,basically like long underwear but more like UA boxer briefs in material.  Great!",5
B0874WHB28,just what he wanted they are great,5
B0874WHB28,These provided no warmth at all. Also no front fly for men. Very disappointing.,1
B0874WHB28,I bought these for my son's for Christmas. They sure look small!!!! I won't know until then. I pray they STRETCH!,3
B0874WHB28,"Adding this review to give reference to others my size. I'm 6'4, 190 lbs, and these fit perfectly. I bought the Large, and these will supplement my kickboxing nicely! I can actually feel them breathing cool air as soon as I put them on. Will be purchasing a few more pairs of the quality holds up.",5
B0874WHB28,"I've worn these in freezing temperatures and even in cold rain. Where as they won't work for everyone in lower temperatures, they are sufficient for 8-10k runs in 30-40 degree temperatures.",5
B0874WHB28,"I run approximately 15-20 miles a week and love wearing these on runs. They're super lightweight, breathable, and non restrictive. It really feels like you're not wearing these at all. I love how super close to the skin these are and they wick sweat away very quickly and easily.If you're active whether it be in the gym or outdoors, you should definitely grab a pair of these. They're worth every cent. I bought one pair and fell in love with them and already grabbed several others.",5
B0874WHB28,These did not provide any warmth at all.,1
B0874WHB28,Very effective for keeping warm. I am a medium on the size chart but I think the medium is too tight around the waist. Large is the right fit for me. Something to keep in mind.,5
B0874WHB28,"Why would anyone wear these without pants? They are great underwear, I didn't even realize they made cold gear, but these work just fine in negative temps.",5
B0874WHB28,"My teenage son uses these compression pants under his shorts during no-gi jujitsu or during muy thai. He is brutal on his clothes! So far, so good!",5
B0874WHB28,"True to size, great value, comfortable and great base layer. originally purchased as a base layer for a hike in the mountains, super comfortable and kept me warm the entire trip. I now wear them under all my clothes on cold days. Highly recommend purchasing if in the market",5
B0874WHB28,The size large is a great fit! Strong enough to cover my thighs and all!!,5
B0874WHB28,"These fit great, and are comfortable to wear. Got them yesterday and wore them today for leg day. They were hardly noticeable while giving me the support I was looking for.Good product, good cost.",5
B0874WHB28,"Solid product, you get what you paid for, but material is flimsy to me. I'm not one to wear this type of thing often so many that's the norm, but it is nothing like my upper body gear.",3
B0874WHB28,"My husband loved it, it is very comfortable and the material is of good quality.",5
B0874WHB28,Makes cold weather hunting easy,5
B0874WHB28,I got 3 each because they don't fall down and are very comfortable. I use them to work outside and they work extremely well.,5
B0874WHB28,"Product works great, they are comfortable and warm. Light weight and no tags/ rough spots.",5

B0CNJS9K87,"It is pricey but the quality is superb. The fabric quality is so smooth and stretchy, light in weight and very durable. The waist retains the support since it does not keep skidding down all the time, especially for people with a tummy. Overall, it is so breathable, one hardly feels one is wearing the underwear. Totally worth the purchase, got myself a second set.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"I never knew a boxer can be this breezy. The material is not only stretchy, but it is also very moisture absorbent. The box fits well and keeps my family jewels nice and cool. I have been wearing it for about 2 months now. Many washes and still looking and feeling new. High recommended.",5
B0CNJS9K87,I'm a 36 waist. The size guide and amazon stressed to get a Large but I went up a size to XL and these are still a tad too tight. Prob should have gotten an XXL and been fine. Also the material is a bit thinner than I'd like. I would have preferred lighter shaded dark colored boxers but there was only black and light colors so I went black.,4
B0CNJS9K87,I've probably tried atleast 10 brands of boxer briefs. These ain't the cheapest but they are so comfy. They do have some cheaper ones but I chose these. I highly recommend these awesome boxers. So light and soft on the fellas.,5
B0CNJS9K87,"very comfortable, like the color variety. actually dont like the day of the week label on the back of each one, because it stresses me out, i have to try to keep them in order in the drawer and it bugs me if they get out of order. i wish the day label wasnt on them.",5
B0CNJS9K87,4 stars only because they came with the days of the week in them. No where in the description does it say they have days of the week patches on them....,4
B0CNJS9K87,"So far, they are very comfortable and the fit is well. True to size. Love the packaging. Only dislike is they are labeled with the weekday. It's classy pring and the day is abbreviated but unnecessary. Who wants to dig they the laundyto make sure they wasshing Mondays breifs? Otherwise they are pretty nice so far. Soft material.",4
B0CNJS9K87,"I have bought my husband Duluth, underwear in the past.  He liked them but I tried something different by buying these!  He loved them.  They are lightweight and much softer.  For sure recommend these.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Probably best value for money when on sale, good comfort, good quality, very stretchy.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Great fit, better feel and I will buy many more.",5
B0CNJS9K87,They are so soft and my husband loves them,5
B0CNJS9K87,Like these very light feeling,4
B0CNJS9K87,Love the material.  Fits well,5
B0CNJS9K87,"My husband loves them, they're his favorite kind of underwear.",5
B0CNJS9K87,Love the material and fitment is great,5
B0CNJS9K87,"Very comfortable, fit great!",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Good quality, waistband does not rise up!",5
B0CNJS9K87,"The greatest indispensable feature of these briefs is the tag on the back that specifies the day of the week to wear them. Never again will I have to wonder if I wore the wrong pair on the wrong day, or waste incalculable hours laboriously labeling my underpants with a marker. Thanks Bamboo Cool for simplifying my life!And if I forget what day it is once I have them on? I can just drop my trousers wherever I am and have a look! Imagine going out for lunch at your favorite restaurant and forgetting whether today is Meatloaf Monday... Now you don't have to worry!And finally, when sexy time happens... What lady could resist when you put on your best Isaac Hayes voice and say, ""Slide over here, woman. I've got my Friday pants on.""Oh, and they're really comfortable too, even if you wear them on the wrong day.",5
B0CNJS9K87,I like the material,5
B0CNJS9K87,Perfect! cool and comfortable,5
B0CNJS9K87,"The fabric is simple divine - bamboo cool needs to make ladies!  Size runs on point, stretch, cool fabric, and nice pattern.",5
B0CNJS9K87,These are nice and they seem to breath im not sweating like before. Thanks,5
B0CNJS9K87,Going to stick with these until they stop making them.,5
B0CNJS9K87,"I am used to receiving good reviews, although I didn't receive the underwear",5
B0CNJS9K87,Very comfortable,4
B0CNJS9K87,Really comfortable and fast shipping,5
B0CNJS9K87,Husband loves these.  Says they are super comfortable.  The band doesn't irritate.,5
B0CNJS9K87,"bought these for my husband.  it is a year later and he wears them every week and they are still comfortable, still have structure and look nice.  he is someone that exercises a lot, so they have been sweated in quite a bit and still are holding strong.",5
B0CNJS9K87,I have bought these boxers every black Friday for years now. They are comfortable and don't ride up. They last all year unlike more expensive pairs that I got from other websites. This year I got two pairs of Mondays and no Wednesday. Small mistake but a big impact. No way to contact seller to fix,4
B0CNJS9K87,My husband really enjoys this product. Very soft and comfortable. Worth every penny.,5
B0CNJS9K87,"Super thin fabric, stretchy awesome made.",5
B0CNJS9K87,They are very comfortable to wear The sizes are perfect,5
B0CNJS9K87,Might not hold up after many washings .,4
B0CNJS9K87,Waist band is comfortable fabric is soft.,5
B0CNJS9K87,Husband loves his briefs. So soft! True to size,5
B0CNJS9K87,"I was skeptic about these since then it appears to be coming from any brand name I had ever heard of but was lured in by the fact that they're made out of bamboo. I have bamboo sheets and they feel amazing so I wanted to give these try. I am so glad I did they feel fantastic they fit perfectly love the fact that they include extra space for your ""package"".",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Soft and gentle is the most accurate descriptive words to use. You don't even feel that you're wearing underwear. Everything sits where it needs to be sitting and the amount of ""adjusting"" has been dismissed. I'm 6'3"" with a waist at 34 and I picked up the Large. Exceptional fit. Invest in these. You're going to want to buy more.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"First of all, these seem to be of good quality and will perform the intended purpose of keeping parts contained and not touching your pants.  I would, however, be remiss if I did not point out a couple of ""quirks"".1) There is a ""day of the week"" label on each pair.  Maybe I should have suspected when they came in a seven-pack, but this was nothing I have encountered beyond the purchase of underwear for my kindergarten aged son.  To add to the conundrum, I am a well-organized professional who now finds himself choosing between following instructions (Mon on Monday, Tue on Tuesday, etc) or throwing caution to the wind and wearing them based on whichever one is on top in my drawer each morning.  I'm not sure which path I will take yet, but either way there is now more stress in my life than underwear should ever have the power to produce.2) Colors...I don't mind colored underwear.  Tighty whities are long in my past.  However, the choice to make one pair brown leads me to believe that the designer of this package is either clueless how that might make a grown man break into spontaneous giggles or an evil genius that has finally provided a solution for which ""most"" people do not have a problem.",4
B0CNJS9K87,I love any comfortable boxers,5
B0CNJS9K87,Best boxers ever I got. Very comfortable,5
B0CNJS9K87,Very comfortable briefs. Will definitely buy more in the future,5
B0CNJS9K87,"So far, so good. I like them so far",4
B0CNJS9K87,"my husband loves these because they are soft, comfortable and true to size. He normally buys Bombas but decided to try these. And they worked. Definitely less expensive than bombas. He has been converted",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Have tried a lot of brands. I was looking for something comfortable that had room for my package. Big enough, but with some flexibility and movement. Want it held but not too tight. These fit the bill.",5
B0CNJS9K87,So far so good.,4
B0CNJS9K87,I decided to try the bamboo cools because the lead brand with the initials TJ had gotten so expensive- three pair for 90 plus dollars compared to Bamboo cools seven pair for about $56- the quality of material and construction of the bamboo cools is excellent- I will buy them again but I have two very minor points to bring up- number one they are more snug than the other brand and next time I will go a size or two larger- number two the waistband isn't quite as wide as the brand with the initials- otherwise a very comfortable and high quality product,4
B0CNJS9K87,"Overall, Nice feel and breathable as others had said. Ended up with 2 pairs that came with holes where stiching was bad after 1 wash, not even worn yet. The company reached out to address concerns. The other pairs are comfortable and good. Mistakes can happen but the company.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Awesome product overall, as advertised.  However, if you are at the top end of the size, I recommend going up one size.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"I wasn't sure how these were going to be, had some wore out old Hanes boxer briefs and needed something new. Lot of the popular competitors out there are super expensive. I stumbled on these ang gave them a chance, really fantastic underwear. They fit nice, soft, comfortable and breathe well. I got 14 pairs and I'm glad, fantastic underwear, especially for the price.",5
B0CNJS9K87,"These are very comfortable underwear, I love the stretchy feel it has. The size runs a bit small but nothing too major. The material is great and lasts a long time.",5
B0CNJS9K87,I bought this larger pack for my husband because he loved the previous 3 pack I got him. They are cooling and comfortable.  I would never have chosen this pack if I knew it had the days of the week sewn on the back of them.  He left kindergarten 46 years ago. I find that aspect of them completely unnecessary.,4
B0CNJS9K87,"Great product, but idk how I feel about having the days of the week stitched into my underwear.  I think that's a feature they should eliminate.  Yes, I fold my underwear, but I don't organize them and ensure I wear the same pair for specific days of the week.Highly recommend the manufacturer drops this useless feature.",4
B0CNJS9K87,I have been married many years and it is safe to say these bamboo boxers are one of the most appreciated gifts I gave my husband. They feel amazing!,5
B0CNJS9K87,"I am on the ""bamboo"" craze...  sheets, socks, shirts, underwear!  They exude less odor, dry ""dry"" and great fit and quality....",5
B0CNJS9K87,"Great fit and feel ... arrived in Texas within 3 days ... one important caveat:  There are two different styles of waist band listed ... the high Grey Band with the Weekday Sticker is coarser and more like elastic than the thin black band without the weekday sticker.  The wider band feels different and the weekday stickers are difficult to remove.  On the other hand, the Weekday sticker does reinforce the seam on the elastic.  It is a matter of preference ... just know the two bands are very different.  Look closely at the photos before ordering different colors. Suggestion to seller ... list the different band styles under different headers vs. Color choices on the same item.  Love the ones with the soft waistband!!",4
B0CNJS9K87,Quality of the fabric is nice.  The only disappointment is the waist band thickness.  I would prefer a thicker band myself.  Would rather spend this kind of money on Ralph Lauren.,3
B0CNJS9K87,"I've worn these for about a month now and I love them.  The material is super soft and very comfortable against my skin.  They seem very breathable and have not caused me to sweat at all.  The cut is great as well and fits just perfect.  They don't seem to stretch out after being worn for extended periods of time, and maintain that comfortable fit and support.  I wore them straight out of the package as well as after being washed and there was no difference after being washed.  Very comfy!  I already ordered a second time...  I definitely recommend!!!",5
B0CNJS9K87,"These are so comfortable, the waistband holds its shape, and room for jewels without feeling squished. The wife loves how they hug my quads and butt. I'm gonna be a lifelong customer !",5
B0CNJS9K87,"wow, these are soft and look really nice on my man. I have never cared for men's undies, but wow.. these are a good thing.",5
B0CNJS9K87,Great material they stay in place all day,5
B0CNJS9K87,Nice now I can remember what day I crapped my undies.,5
B0CNJS9K87,I like the different colors and the fit me well,5
B0CNJS9K87,"Fact they advertise don't ride up, WRONG! These ride up worse than Haynes & Fruit of the Loom. Pit em on and riding up my leg not long after. BUUUTT they are comfortable material, breathe well and durability...well time will tell. It's absolutely a lie to advertise they don't ride up considering it wasn't even 20min of wearing them and had issues .",3
B0CNJS9K87,"Like them, a lot, very comfortable fit, just right.",4
B0CNJS9K87,Brand name on elastic waste band was faulty looking. Did I get my money's worth? We'll see.,3
B0CNJS9K87,Most comfortable ever,5
B0CNJS9K87,"These underwear came with a tag on the back matching in color, and have a day of the week each tag. Its cute that the underwear manufacturer wants me to match a color to each day of the week. I prefer to choose my own adventure, and not be locked into picking the brown underwear every Monday.To people who don't feel the need to psychoanalyze what color of underwear matches best with their day ahead, there is another problem. I've noticed a decent amount of fuzz accumulate on the inside of my pants when i wear these, and the underwear themselves get little pieces of fiber balls stuck to them.I'm able to nitpick, but they fit (got a 4x), and they were very cheap (less than $10 a pair). so they're getting the job done.",3
B00JUM2VAQ,"They are true to size and very soft. If your looking for a cheap hoodie to add you own logos to this is the hoodie. It's a hanes hoodie. Quality is good, the style is nice, and the weight is just perfect",5
B00JUM2VAQ,"I bought three of these hoodie sweatshirts in size small: Black, Red and Gold. I bought the black first and loved it and ordered the other two colors. Here is what each one delivered:  BLACK: Nice thick fabric, fits like a true small which is exactly what I wanted - a fitted look. No complaints.GOLD: Was supposed to be more like a mustard color but it is yellow. Fabric is softer and fluffy. 1 inch longer than the black and fits looser so not quite the fitted look I expected.RED: Pretty red color. Thinner fabric, 1 inch longer than the black and loosest fit of all 3.  None of these issues are deal breakers, however I purchased  the first black one to test out the fabric/fit before I purchased the 2 additional colors. And as you can see, it was a mixed bag.",4
B00JUM2VAQ,I purchased 2 hoodies for my son and he loves them. The colors are as expected and the material is nice and thick so it keeps him warm. This hoodie is not cheaply made at all. He wanted these particular hoodies for the large pocket size and they were just what he wanted. The size was accurate. Would recommend this brand and would purchase again at this price point.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,I had hoodies but some were quite old and just wanted new fresh ones.I bought this and Jerzees. I got a heavier weight in Jerzees BUT.....after washing in cold and drying in the dryer....the head hole on the Jerzees is so SMALL and the hood feels like it's stuck to my neck and head.  When I pull the hood over my head it seems to small or tight. This one by Hanes  is a really good perfect fit after washing and I don't feel I'm going to lose an ear or be strangled.  Head hole.  The Hanes is a slightly lighter weight fabric.  It won out on shrinkage from drying.  I would buy this again!!!!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"I love the color choices, I got Spanish Moss, the color is beautiful.  The size is perfect, I can wear a shirt under or not. If I could change one thing: reduce the polyester (its 50%). But that's petty, esp with the price under $20. It feels comfy! I'll probably buy more. Thanks Hanes!",5
B00JUM2VAQ,These are true to size and very comfortable. Purchased several of these for custom hoodies for a party we did and they were a monster hit. Will purchase again for the next party.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,I order this item around  Christmas. I just opened this item that has been worn. It has a stain on it and smells like Mens colonge. I'm so disappointed. I've order hoodie before and this has never happened. I KNOW it has to be some type of QA on returned item. This is unacceptable!!!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Wasn't sure what to expect but it arrived quickly and has become my go to for casual wardrobe wear on cooler days & nights. Quality stitching and rich color. No regrets making this purchase.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,The light grey is such a perfect fit and weight! I bought a few different colors and the material/softness/weight varies. The pink is definitely more sheer and soft but still great. Can't beat them for the price. I'll be ordering more asap!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,I purchased this hoodie for my daughter who works at the front register at a sports store. The doors are often open and she is very cold. She can only wear black according to store rules. My daughter said that this hoodie was a game changer for her. She was surprised by how warm it kept her during her entire shift. It is true to size.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,It's a good hoodie but only for cool weather. It's very lightweight & won't keep you warm if it's cold outside but perfect for cool days.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,"I have been buying Hanes products since I can buy my own clothes, I been wearing Hanes briefs since a kid , I buy there socks , briefs,tank tops ect never bought there hoodies, am really happy with the ones I bought, this company never lets me down .",5
B00JUM2VAQ,The hoodie is very comfortable and lightweight for the price you can't go wrong my only complaint is the length should have been at least a couple of inches longer,4
B00JUM2VAQ,I purchased several of these in different colors.  All of them are nice.  Great value and quality.  Everyone I gave one too was very happy.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Not the greatest weight on the hoodie but for the cost when it's on sale there are no complaints. It's comfortable and soft on the inside and outside.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,I love these hoodies I order them all the time amazing product great comfortable true to size and fast shipping,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Apologies.  I got mixed up in prior review.  The shipment I was complaining about was not this item,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Bought for my nephew its a great easy basic at value price. Quality better than expected.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,"I ordered a medium and its so comfortable i love it so much already. I will be ordering more in different colors. Its lightweight so not crazy warm, but its cozy. Its not stiff like other sweater i have. 10/10 recommend.Im about 5ft 3in, and around 130lbs",5
B00JUM2VAQ,Great quality! A heavy weight hoodie that fits well and seems to be well made! I recommend it!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,My son wears these all of the time and loves them! Nice fabric and they wash well.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"i got the pink hoodie and the color was just as it was shown in the picture. I love it! the only downside of it are the drawstrings, they were a brighter color than the hoodie and they feel kind of cheap, and the pocket felt like it was made of thinner material. Overall, a good product!",4
B00JUM2VAQ,Color was great but the material felt cheap not like normal Hanes brand. Did not like the fit shoulders were puffy.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,As described. Got a couple of these for my son for Christmas & he loves them.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,These were great for my teenage son.  Easy to wear and washed well.  The price was good.  The colors were perfect.  The quality is good as well.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,My wife has trouble finding items that are true to sixZe and this absolutely is. The quality of the material is great,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"These seemed too short in the torso. They are on the cheaper side of fabric quality but the price reflects that. If you need something short term and plain, these are it. I returned them because they just didn't look like they would stand up to being worn 4 times a week and washed just as much.",4
B00JUM2VAQ,Wash and dry inside out before using or fuzzy will come off on clothes,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Great price and nice and warm. This was a gift for a family member and he was very cozy wearing it. Great quality.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,i got this for my brothers present for christmas and he loves it and wears it all the time!! it was a great price and is so so soft and comfy. the blue hoodies color is so so cute,5
B00JUM2VAQ,i got this for my brothers present for christmas and he loves it and wears it all the time!! it was a great price and is so so soft and comfy. the blue hoodies color is so so cute,5
B00JUM2VAQ,I was surprisedthat this sweatshirts so skimpy. I reordered another one at a much larger size. It was cheap at twice the orice.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,Thick fabric. Very cozy and warm. Fits as expe ted. Medium fits medium.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Purchase for my mom and she loves it. Bigger fit than most other brands witch is a plus for her.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Bought it on sale so i'd say its a great value. Its good as your fall/spring hoodie but you need to layer up for winter. Its true to size.,4
B00JUM2VAQ,Very nice.  Not too thick to where it's bulky but also warm enough.  Wrist cuffs were a little tight but I'm hoping they stretch with time.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Original Hanes hoodie hood for the gym,4
B00JUM2VAQ,By far the most comfortable hoodie I've ever bought. Truly phenomenal!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Review for the bigger boys.. good fit and finish. Keeping it's color and quality. Light weight and keeping me warm. I use under overalls doing service work. I like this hoodie and would purchase again.  Recommend one size up but your size too will be fine.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Man this jacket is warm and worth what it cost,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"It was soooooo comfortable, me and my friends all bought one and love wearing them! They are a great quality and the color is perfect, fits so well!",4
B00JUM2VAQ,"After the first one came in, I immediately purchased more. The price is great and you can't pass up a good deal like this on high quality branded products. Actually a long hoodie which is the best part",5
B00JUM2VAQ,Color black washes well without fading. Sized well. Nice and firm not cheap material. I will buy another one,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Warm and cozy. Price is Rosie.  Thumbs up.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Warm and cozy. Price is Rosie.  Thumbs up.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Great deal and my son wears it all the time,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Great feel!  Solid purchase for the money.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,All time favorite plain hoodie. They are shaped normal and so soft! I only wash an hang dry them to keep them super soft longer! We only get pullovers. I got all 4 kids one for Christmas!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Good. Shrinks after washes,4
B00JUM2VAQ,"I am a big guy so when I saw these where available in a 5xl and in the black Friday sale I grabbed one for me and my dad. I have not given my dad his yet, but I opened mine and I like it but not as great as I was hoping for. It's not as soft as I thought a Fleece sweatshirt would be and it defiantly runs smaller. It fits more like a 4xl so it's a little tight, but it will still work to keep me warm this winter.  I will update after the holiday and my dad try's his on being a xl.",4
B00JUM2VAQ,Loved it. Great price and fast delivery.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"Lightweight, comfy around the house. Love it.",5
B00JUM2VAQ,Just as described good quality would buy again,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Loved my sweater nice and lightweight,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Great price! Soft and comfortableNice color,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"This is a nice hoodie, however the gold is what I would call ""school bus yellow"". Definitely not the color I wanted.",4
B00JUM2VAQ,Bought this for my son. He wears it all the time. Really soft fabric.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Good material and correct sizing,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Great quality and great price.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"True to size, fits great!",5
B00JUM2VAQ,Perfect hoodie for my son!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Very warm and comfy,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Warmer than I thought,5
B00JUM2VAQ,teen daughter loved it,5
B00JUM2VAQ,My teen loves it.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,True to size. Comfortable.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Good quality and very comfortable!,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Bought this for my hard to please teen. Got rave reviews. Good fit. The quality is worth the price. It's fairly lightweight with a sturdy zipper. Color is exactly as pictured.,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"The hoodie is comfortable and for my size (XL) it fits really well. It's not too big and it's not small either. But if the neck hole was sized a little bit bigger it would be nice. The pocket is also I liitle it smaller than other hoodies, but I rarely use the pocket so it doesn't bother me that much. All in all though it's a nice hoodie.",4
B00JUM2VAQ,Love this hoodie,5
B00JUM2VAQ,"Warm and no shrinkageSize correct no zipper no fading in wash,good value",4
B00JUM2VAQ,Size up,5
B00JUM2VAQ,Nice quality,5
B086L316XC,"I am extremely satisfied with my purchase! These boxers are incredibly comfortable and made from soft, breathable fabric that keeps me cool throughout the day. The fit is perfect, providing just the right amount of support without being too tight. They hold up well after multiple washes, maintaining their shape and softness. Plus, the waistband is snug but not restrictive. I highly recommend Hanes boxers to anyone looking for reliable, comfortable, and durable underwear!",5
B086L316XC,"excellent fit and support. excellent feel. used to wear boxers, no more! just the right product since I have to use dependsshields.",5
B086L316XC,"Very good product.Comfortable, fits well",5
B086L316XC,"These are my go-to underwear. They're soft, breathable, and don't show any panty lines under my clothes. I especially appreciate the variety of styles and colors available. They wash and dry well without any shrinking or fading.""",5
B086L316XC,"These underwear are a very good quality. Thick, sturdy, and taglesss. The price point for how many you get is way lower than buying them at the store. They shrink a little on the first wash. Color is nice. Fades a little after many washes, especially the black ones. All in all a good buy. I would buy again.",5
B086L316XC,"I wasn't expecting much but I am very pleased with the quality and fit of these boxer briefs. They are very comfortable & unnoticeable after putting them on.  My FAVORITE quality is the waistband that does not peel over or crease during movement or exercise!!!!  This always bothered me with my ""Joe Boxer"" briefs that I was otherwise very happy with completely.  Not any more.",5
B086L316XC,This brand comes with a covered elastic band which is a priority for those that have allergy to natural or man made latex. Its the only brand my allergy stricken child can wear however I have noticed over the last several years the QC is a bit suspect. Oftentimes uneven hems or loose threads and inconsistent sizing has been an issue. The biggest worry is they are a lot thinner than they used to be which is great for the company because they can sell more when the boxers wear out faster but irritating for the customer. We are forced to buy more because the quality is less for a higher price. Irritating. I remember purchasing these every couple of years because they would last that long and now its every year. Very irritating.,4
B086L316XC,"My first time using these was a winner. The product fits perfectly, it doesn't run, and best of all, it is cooler than any other I've tried.",5
B086L316XC,"I have sensitive skin, so the plastic elastic bands really irritate me and these being the cloth is fantastic and very relieving highly recommend if you have sensitive skin",5
B086L316XC,Husband likes themHe said they were comfortableNot too hard and not too hotStay in place,5
B086L316XC,On time and as advertised,5
B086L316XC,"Good Quality, nice for work",5
B086L316XC,The most durable and comfortable boxer briefs . The moisture control and breathable material is what makes the sale for us . They have many color combinations. Not heavy and never shrink after washing .,5
B086L316XC,My son is picky and he likes them!,5
B086L316XC,Hubs says they are true to size and the band is very comfortable and strong. Breathable chonies,4
B086L316XC,"They fit so well with the size but don't stretch, that makes lose comfort.",4
B086L316XC,Very good quality I must say I am satisfied true to size,5
B086L316XC,I have bought Hanes moisturizer wicking for my husband for years.  These have longer leg to them and was something he had to get use to.I hope the legs being longer that chaffing will not be a problem.,5

B086L316XC,"Good quality, good fit. What else can you say about underwear?",5
B086L316XC,"My spouse cannot stand elastic directly next to his skin or boxers that ride low on the hip. These boxers have covered elastic and fit just the way he wants, mid waist. There are a few other brands with covered waistbands, but they all hang too low on the hips for his comfort.  He says this brand does not ride up or down once he has them on. The fabric is a nice medium weight, no-see-through cotton knit. They do pill a little, but are sturdy and have made it through it least 30 wash/dry cycles with no sign of wear and tear.",5
B086L316XC,Feels like underwear,4
B086L316XC,I've been wearing BVD's for a long time but they are too hard to find now. Thought these looked close to the same style. They fit well though the waist line might be a little high. The material looks thin but so far so good. Seem like a decent brief.,4

B086L316XC,Quality products however two of them were only 75% cotton as it is advertised. I wish it was advertised as it is actually labeled on the product itself.,4

B014RQ1L1O,"I recently purchased the Gildan Unisex Fleece Hoodie Sweatshirt, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! This hoodie has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe for so many reasons.Firstly, the comfort level is off the charts! The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, making it perfect for lounging around the house or layering up on chilly days. Plus, the fit is just right - not too tight, not too loose, just comfortably snug.Secondly, the quality is exceptional. I've washed this hoodie several times already, and it still looks brand new. The stitching is strong, the fabric doesn't pill, and the color hasn't faded at all. It's clear that this hoodie was built to last.Thirdly, the versatility is unmatched. Whether I'm running errands, hitting the gym, or heading out for a casual outing with friends, this hoodie fits the bill. It's effortlessly stylish and pairs well with just about anything in my wardrobe.Fourthly, the price point is unbeatable. Considering the quality and comfort you're getting, this hoodie is an absolute steal. It's rare to find such a well-made garment at such an affordable price.And finally, the fact that it's unisex is a huge bonus. It's great to see a brand like Gildan prioritizing inclusivity and offering clothing that anyone can feel comfortable and confident wearing.Overall, I can't recommend the Gildan Unisex Fleece Hoodie Sweatshirt enough. It's comfortable, durable, stylish, affordable, and inclusive - what more could you ask for in a hoodie? Five stars all the way!",5
B014RQ1L1O,I bought these to use as the base for heat transfer vinyl. They have a nice weight to them but not too heavy.  The vinyl looks great on them and I will be buying more.I wish the stock of colors and sizes was better but maybe that is because it was the holiday season.,4
B014RQ1L1O,Comfortable. Fits as expected. Good quality - have had no loose stitching or any problems. Has become a go-to hoodie on many occasions.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"Given the low cost of this sweatshirt, it's an admirable sweatshirt. I wear hoodies every day and this suits my need for colorful variety. Fits normal, in my opinion. Green is vibrant, like the ""Kelley"" green I was wanting.",5
B014RQ1L1O,Bought this for a halloween costume because it was cheaper to DIY the costume then buy a costume. Plus I can use it for multiple occasions. Very durable and I love the way it fits when I wore it for halloween and for other occasions. Very comfortable,5
B014RQ1L1O,This sweater is the best one yet. I love how soft it is on the inside and the weight it's very light too. The size is big but it also fits perfectly.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"Absolutely perfect! Even better than I expected. Exactly as described, fit perfect and material wise, could not be better. The next day delivery was also an awesome bonus. Ordered for my husband for work and could not be happier!",5
B014RQ1L1O,"GOOD FIT, GOOD BLEND OF FIBERS, AND NOT TOO COSTLY.I am ordering another one today!",4
B014RQ1L1O,Exactly as I expected.  Comfortable fit.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"The colors are a little off in the pics (this looked dark green but said dark Heather gray) but that's okay. It came in dark gray which is fine by me & for the price, can't beat it! Will definitely be ordering more as this one gets worn out. Can't say much about laundering it bc I haven't yet but I got a size up from what I normally do so not worried about shrinkage.",5
B014RQ1L1O,Great quality hoodie. I ordered an XL because that is my normal size and wanted to be safe that it fit even though I knew it was unisex sizing and could run large. The XL was gigantic on me (5'5'' and 210lbs) so I gave it to my teenage daughter who loved the baggy look. I'm going back for a large and in a few more colors!,5
B014RQ1L1O,Ive been purchasing this brand for years now and these hoodies can last years no complaints,5
B014RQ1L1O,"Comfy, good quality, pullover hoodie, I live in mine all the time.",5
B014RQ1L1O,"Just a great sweatshirt, good fit good finish and they last a longtime",5
B014RQ1L1O,Perfect for the cool days!,5
B014RQ1L1O,"I took off one star because of two reasons. One, if you ever have to roll up your sleeve even a little bit it will stretch and lose it's shape forever! there is no snap back in these hoodies whatsoever. I have a few that one arm hangs down my palm. I am going to have to use a needle and thread to fix it. The second reason is they shed like crazy before the first two wash cycles so make sure you turn them inside out and wash them before you attempt to wear them, other than that they are very thick and warn. I have purchased several in two different sizes. If you can get past those two things this will be a great buy for anyone trying to stay warm",4
B014RQ1L1O,"I love this hoodie, I've had it for a few years. Used it as a work hoodie. Comfortable, warm, looks decent..",5
B014RQ1L1O,These last. Don't shrink. The color stays true. Thick and warm. Highly recommend.,5

B014RQ1L1O,"I ordered two colors, white and black, both for an embroidery. Black performs very well in the machine, white is too thin and large holes are torn. The material of the black is heavy, the white is light and thin, both are soft on the inside.",4
B014RQ1L1O,Decent material but shrinks,4
B014RQ1L1O,Very happy with the quality and price of this product. It's really hard to find sweatshirts in my size for this price so I was happy to come across these.,5
B014RQ1L1O,I use to put images on with my cricut. Washes up great. Very little shrinkage,5
B014RQ1L1O,I needed one last minute for my small business. Worked great.,5
B014RQ1L1O,Nothing like a hoodie for this weather. Love it and great color,5

B014RQ1L1O,The green sweatshirt is a very nice color. I was able to and a large patch to the front for the holidays.  Its fits true to size. I would recommend this brand.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"Not too thick and not too thin, very comfortable and breathable. Able to work out in it",5
B014RQ1L1O,I purchased this for my cousin so I can design it for her and she love itttt,5
B014RQ1L1O,Material pretty good,4
B014RQ1L1O,Quality material and construction only problem is sizing 3X fits like a tight 2X,4
B014RQ1L1O,i order from these guys a lot.. good hoodies & fast shipping... normally they arrive nice & neatly folded.. this time it was wadded up in a ball & bag & delivered shoved in a weird long skinny shoe box looking pkg.. =/ will have to try to iron out all the wrinkles before i can even print on it for my customer's order.,4
B014RQ1L1O,"I love these hoodies, because I do a lot of creating from my Cricut and these work well for an iron on. They wash up well and are comfortable.",5
B014RQ1L1O,My all time FAVORITE HOODIES!!!!! So soft in side true to size and so comfortable!!!! These are a Must in every color,5

B014RQ1L1O,Can't go wrong with Gildan,5
B014RQ1L1O,Person liked it.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is one of the best hoodies for the price that I've purchased. The quality is great. It's keeping me warm. I went from a medium to a large for an oversized look, but it looks great. I love that there's so many color options available as well and the weight is perfect where you can layer it with a t-shirt underneath and not be overly hot inside",5
B014RQ1L1O,always my favorite hoodie to buy,5
B014RQ1L1O,I use these as a general maintenance worker and they are great. They hold up well and are warm too.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"I bought this for my son to go with his Halloween costume. He and two of his friends were Alvin and the Chipmunks and he needed this to complete his Theodore outfit. It worked great. Probably not the best color for an everyday sweatshirt unless you really like green, but he has worn it since Halloween. So all in all it was a great buy.",5
B014RQ1L1O,This hoodie have stains the stain in front of the shirt as you see,3
B014RQ1L1O,Go one size up unless you like it fitted fit,3
B014RQ1L1O,"Very soft, comfortable, fits very well!",5
B014RQ1L1O,I would best compare to a proclub hoodie but definitely not as thick/warm. Would not buy again.,3
B014RQ1L1O,Lovely hoodie! Very cozy! Perfect!,5
B014RQ1L1O,Awesome,5
B014RQ1L1O,"Seems like a nice quality hoodie, it's comfortable to wear. Washed it once, so far so good",4
B014RQ1L1O,Gildan makes good quality blanks. They are durable and hold embroidery really well. That being said my biggest struggle is with Gildan hoodies. They neck is very tight and the hoodie part is small. But they are still better than other brand hoodies on quality alone. 8/10,4
B014RQ1L1O,Love this brand for mens hoodies. Never a problem with the material. Thick enough to be warm but not overheating. Sleeves are long enough for mens arms also. Very important for the person wearing it.,5
B014RQ1L1O,Great quality and great price.,5
B014RQ1L1O,My 15yr old boy loves it very much.,5
B014RQ1L1O,This is a thin hoodie. So would be good for teens who wear year round. But was a cheaper texture than I expected.,3
B014RQ1L1O,Excellent high quality brand.,5
B014RQ1L1O,"Very basic hoodie, ok",3
B014RQ1L1O,"I find myself returning to Gildan time and time again for everything from socks and underwear to t-shirts and sweatshirts. I purchased several of these Gildan hoodies for work. They're reasonably priced, which is important when they're going to be worn in dirty and dusty construction environments and will need to be replaced eventually. Gildan offers most of its products in a variety of colors including hi-viz green and orange which suits my needs. I did order one size larger than usual and found it to fit comfortably, even before washing, so consider that and other reviews as you review the options before purchasing.",5
B014RQ1L1O,Great over all hoodie if you make vinyl items this works great for that and an amazing price,4
B014RQ1L1O,For 17.00 dollars this is a good deal. I wear hoodies daily and this is a good fit and comfortable.  For daily wear I love it.,5
B014RQ1L1O,Heavy hoodie ..cold days aheadIt will definitely work out fine this fall,4
B014RQ1L1O,Fit's perfectly,5
B014RQ1L1O,Great fit and soft,5

B086L77BVP,These are very well made and great colors and patterns! He said they fit well and are comfortable. He made the mistake of telling me that he needed socks and underwear so that was what Santa brought him! LOL. He got other stuff too......,5
B086L77BVP,Waistband comfortable. Size true. No shrinkage. Loved the cotton content. Good quality will purchase again when needed - have purchased these before,5
B086L77BVP,"I recently bought the Hanes Men's Tagless Boxer Underwear with the exposed waistband, but unfortunately, I'm not entirely satisfied. The material feels quite cheap and is a bit see-through, which is disappointing. I expected better quality from Hanes.That said, the tagless design is comfortable, and the waistband fits well without being too tight. The variety in the multi-packs is nice, and they do stay in place throughout the day.Overall, they are okay for the price, but I would have preferred a more substantial fabric.",4
B086L77BVP,"Great length, good variety pack, perfect elastic that doesn't dig into your waist, breathable, true to size, great quality, holds up wash after wash, no holes, tears, or pilling",5
B086L77BVP,Always good quality. Comfortable. Sizing accurate.,5
B086L77BVP,"Santa decided my husband needed some new skivvies last Christmas. He delivered a package of Hanes Men's Tagless Boxer Underwear, Exposed Waistband knowing that hubby had the same type before and liked them. (They're pretty durable and comfy.) Excellent choice!",5
B086L77BVP,Fit. And look good enough for my ol lady comfortable. they made of cotton and good quality.,5
B086L77BVP,"Not bad for the price. Nice color and shape. Wasteband nice elastic. Down side is 55 cotton 45 polyester material is VERY thin and does not flex like 80 cotton 20 polyester and thicker material. Kind of like wearing a polyester button up shirt that cuts into your underarms because it does not flex.  I will try them in the summer heat due to light material, but am wondering how these will handle summer perspiration. There is no button fly, but it stays closed ok.I will next purchase 80/20, heavier softer material, about 3 inches longer, button fly.Just due to my preferences.",4
B086L77BVP,"They Are A Perfect Fit, No Shrinkage At All.The Quality Is Just As Good As The Fit. It Was A Christmas Gift. Thank You, Patricia Bopst",5
B086L77BVP,I am 44 in the waist and the 3x fit me comfortably and doesn't feel tight in my thighs and hips,5

B086L77BVP,Always loved product for decades.. now these dont maintaine waistline an smaller sizes are too small.. stuck in the middle w out you hanes,4
B086L77BVP,Ok but be warned they run small and if you don't size up you will be doing a lot of shifting and pulling.,4

B086L77BVP,Great boxers good design and fit very well. They are comfortable and stay in place.,5
B086L77BVP,First time boxer wearer at age 57. Purchased because I needed loose fitting underwear in the waist band. I had total knee replacement surgery and need underwear that can fit on and be removed easily while wearing a brace. These worked well for me. Thank you.,4
B086L77BVP,"I'm one of those guys who hasn't bought boxers in a very long time. I mean if they're clean keep wearing them right?  I recently had a couple of pairs tear on me, and decided to get a pack of these as a refresh.I know they're trendy now, but I haven't worn briefs since I was in elementary school, and that's not going to change just because ""Boxer Briefs"" are in style now. I will be a boxer guy the rest of my life.I checked these out at Wally World one day just to see if different packages had different boxers, and they DO NOT. Every package has the same 6 pairs of boxer shorts. Yes, the blue one is a duplicate, which is a little annoying. You couldn't come up with 6 different designs for the 6 pack?I can actually wear 3 sizes for boxers (Medium, Large, X-Large). I can still wear some old mediums where the waist band has stretched out over time. I'm probably a Large, but I buy X-Large cuz I tend to wear everything loose.The first time I wore them without being washed, they were felt slightly too big, but after a couple of washes they've shrunk a little bit to my ideal loose, but not falling down my waist size. I give them a 4-4.5, but I'll round up. They're what I expected. I think they cost way too much (6 for $24), but everything has gone up in price lately. Comfort is fine, fit okay, but annoyed that they could only come up with 5 styles and that one is a duplicate. I wish some of the designs were darker.",5
B086L77BVP,"The product material itself looks ok, but how this is sewn raises questions. I put on underwear in the morning and in the middle of the day realized that I was losing them))). The threads came apart in the middle,  right on top of the fly. Funny feeling))))",3
B086L77BVP,"The size chart indicated I should get Medium. I got Larges for a little extra room. Good thing I did because these are tighter than I expected and Medium definitely would not have fit. The elastic is about an inch shorter circumference than expected for the size. This matters when you have tree trunks for thighs... The legs are just loose enough to not be a hindrance. I can do a 'super kick' without constriction, or risk of tearing. So, enough crotch room, as long as you can deal with your member sliding out the really short leg to say hello. Material is typical quality to be expected now a days. Higher prices for lower quality like everything else. I would buy again, just XL this time. Two sizes above the recommended...",4
B086L77BVP,Quality Product..... Lightning Shipping.... Thanx !!!,5
B086L77BVP,These fit very well.,5
B086L77BVP,Very nice,5

B086L77BVP,Cumple mis expectativas 10/10,5
B086L77BVP,Nice cotton and cool. Functional solution for a good price.,4
B086L77BVP,"Purchasing this item was preceded by one of the most bizarre arguments in my life.  My mom died last year, and I recently moved to live with my dad. He's in his eighties, and mom did everything for him. He's had an interesting time of it. The learning curve was rather steep.  I came home from the grocery store, and carried half of it in. I saw a basket of laundry in the mudroom. I'm trying very hard not to take chores from him he can do himself, but good roommate etiquette prompted me to offer to start the load for him when I headed back to the car to get the rest. He said he had it, so I dropped it, and got the groceries. Once I got back in the house, he complained mom had only got him five pair last time, and he was running out of underwear before the week was out. I thought it my head, it's been a year, and you could have taken care of this if it really bothered you, but I didn't say that. I pulled out my kindle fire and offered to order some for him with Amazon Prime. He glared at me as if I had offered to poison the dog.  Now, we live ten miles from the nearest grocery store and twenty from the closest Wal-Mart. I love my dad enough to move halfway across the country, but not enough to spend half of a day shopping for underwear, not to mention how long it would take to return it if I got the wrong thing, and wasting gas on all that runaround... I have returned things I bought on Amazon before, and it's much simpler.  I asked him what size he wore, and confirmed he liked boxers as he glowered down his nose at me. I found this item, and enlarged the picture. When I handed him the device, you'd think I was asking him to hold a rattlesnake.  He squinted at the picture, and scowled over his glasses at me. ""I don't know what brand these are.""  ""They're Hanes, dad. Blue plaid, just like the ones you have.""  ""I'll be really mad at you if this is the wrong thing.""  I think to myself, he's not going to go shopping with me if I went to get them, and explain how to return them if I have to.  He delicately handed me back my kindle, as if it might bite.  I asked him if wants one or two five packs. He tells me he only needs two pairs.  ""They only come in a five pack. That's why mom bought five last time.""  ""I carry a grudge and won't forget this, if you get me the wrong thing.""  I decided to take my life in my hands and ordered this item. It came at the time promised, and was exactly as listed: five pair tagless blue plaid cotton boxers.  Dad was pleased. He even insisted on paying me back for them, although he still doesn't understand why underwear comes in a five pack when there are seven days in a week.",5
B086L77BVP,Fit's good good quality.,4
B086L77BVP,"excellent value. 12 tagless boxers. 1 wash and they were soft. I love buying bulk packs like this. Spend a bit more now and save in the long run!  I sleep in boxers, just 1 size bigger, freedom of movement...  out with the old, in with the new.  I never have issues with HANE'S products. Buy the family pack of socks too !!",4
B086L77BVP,True to size,5
B086L77BVP,Ripped holes in my other shorts. Great replacementQuick shipping,4
B086L77BVP,"For skivvies, I guess that's what we want. But they are definitely ""underwear"" boxers, not PJs.",4
B086L77BVP,They fit well and last a long time.,5
B086L77BVP,Could be softer but ok,4
B086L77BVP,"I originally ordered these with 2 day prime. I got them a week later, opened with a few pairs missing. I let them know the issue. They immediately had another set sent to me I guess immediately because I got them in under 18 hours after requesting a return for an exchange.5 stars not only for the quality of the boxers at this price point, but also for the quickness of resolution with customer care.",5
B086L77BVP,"The fly area looks almost perfectly like the rest of the shorts.  I have to work too hard to find the front from the back, lol.  Sounds like a weird complaint, but it's the first underwear I have owned that has had that issue.  Otherwise, they are fine.",3
B086L77BVP,"These are simply good underwear.The bands are a little bulky, but durable.They are comfortable.",4
B00W80Z87K,The product came relatively fast and delivery service was good and fabric quality was good it had comfort and was thick enough it also was a good size it's value mirrors it's price in terms of tank tops it might just be Flattering.,5
B00W80Z87K,"This were perfect for my husband, first they were a little too small for medium but over time they stretched and worked well.",4
B00W80Z87K,These shirts are made of comfortable cotton and are not scratchy. They are nice and long. I have an ileostomy bag and these help to conceal it. I have bought them three times I like them so much.,5
B00W80Z87K,These undershirts are so soft. great colors and fit great,5
B00W80Z87K,"Fits perfectly, feels good on the skin. Good quality material. Great value",5
B00W80Z87K,"they seem ok, does there job. hard to get a good quality cotton tank top anymore. fruit of loom quality over years went down in my eyes. in past you could count on it and now its like your afraid to buy them anymore. miss good old days",3
B00W80Z87K,I received my package and the box was fine but my package of 6 shirts were open and there was only 5 in the package and it was not in the box!  I did not return them or ask for refund because my Son needed them now but I was disappointed.  I rarely have any issues with any products so this was unusual.,4
B00W80Z87K,Great quality will stretch over time but for the most part they are really nice and cannot be seen under clothes,5
B00W80Z87K,Love these I bought them so long ago and my husband just got to wear these and he is really tall so imagine the stretch on these.,4
B00W80Z87K,Bought the extra xxl size. After washing they fit perfectly.,5
B00W80Z87K,"Well made, very soft and comfortable. Would buy again",5
B00W80Z87K,"I am 280# 6'2"" and the 4x T's are perfect. If you wear these tank tops for an undershirt you won't be disappointed, they are plenty long enough to stay tucked in all day long.",5
B00W80Z87K,"These are really great, they keep you comfortable and they wash well.",5
B00W80Z87K,It was fine received everything,5
B00W80Z87K,"They are of excellent quality, I recommend them.",5
B00W80Z87K,"Love these tank tops! Soft, moisture-wicking, and tag-free - perfect for everyday wear. Great value for the price!",5
B00W80Z87K,I ordered this pack of white undershirts for my teenage son they fit him perfectly the quality and wearability is nice they are not too thick and make for a decent undershirt. They are semi see through.,5
B00W80Z87K,Comfortable and fit well but I needed a size smaller than usual for shirts.,5
B00W80Z87K,"Good price and product, and came from USA so I would buy again from this seller, thank you Amazon.",5
B00W80Z87K,"My son loves these. These are nice and thick, very soft material and great quality.",5
B00W80Z87K,This shirts they run a size smaller,5
B00W80Z87K,True to size would definitely buy again,4
B00W80Z87K,Buena tela.,5
B00W80Z87K,"Exceptional quality, blending durability and elegance.",4
B00W80Z87K,"My husband is absolutely delighted with these A tanks. He feels that the cotton is very soft, fresh, and wicks away moisture well, even in our country's hot climate.",5
B00W80Z87K,Great quality product as I aspected . Great service from company as well as the driver.,5
B00W80Z87K,Good quality,5
B00W80Z87K,"Like the selection of colors.  We ordered size XL because they are longer but still are snug on your torso.  They fit our model who is 6'2"" and weighs 195 perfectly.  Wach in cold water to keep from shrinking and dry med-low heat for only a few minutes. Would buy again.  Tagless too!",4
B00W80Z87K,"great qualit, color and true size",5
B00W80Z87K,Great fits perfectly,5
B00W80Z87K,Best cotton and good fit,4
B00W80Z87K,Very good comfortable,5
B00W80Z87K,Found out he had just ordered pkg for himself!  The colors were very vivid upon arrival. Hope they remain so. They were not see through and he favors this brand,5
B00W80Z87K,Love the material and how it fits comfortably,5
B00W80Z87K,Perfect for my needs.  I really like the long length.  They wash and dry very well.  I only wish the arm openings were not so big.,4
B00W80Z87K,"Very Tru to size, good quality and comfortable!",5
B00W80Z87K,Nice,5
B00W80Z87K,"Great fit, good quality fabric that is not too thick",5
B00W80Z87K,"I've gotten these tops before in the same size, but due to a lot of wear and some getting holes, I wanted to refresh my supply. Unfortunately, this latest batch is much larger than the previous size larges I'd gotten. I like the added length but it's just overall so much bigger. Included a pic of a new ""large"" on bottom with the old ""large"" on top of it. Huge difference!",4
B00W80Z87K,Have tried many other tanks and they always seem to be too coarse and sheer but this one takes the cake the quality is remarkable in comparison and is thick but still thin enough to be breathable and is crazy soft. Highly recommend,5
B00W80Z87K,"My husband like it, the size it perfect, good quality.",5
B00W80Z87K,Nice colors and good price.,5
B00W80Z87K,"As a man who is 87% torso, these are very nice. First ones I found that don't expose my belly.",5
B00W80Z87K,"Love these tanks! Super soft, breathable, and moisture-wicking. Perfect for everyday wear or working out. True to size and tag-free for added comfort. Great value!""",5
B00W80Z87K,Obsessed with these vest. I buy them very often,5
B00W80Z87K,"Fit to size. Well made undershirts.Good price,too.",5
B00W80Z87K,Great price for these in bulk! I can never find my husband's size in the store BC it's sold out!,5
B00W80Z87K,Good price,5
B00W80Z87K,"I love the way fruit of the loom tanks fit, and they don't have much shrinkage after washing.",5
B00W80Z87K,These shirts look and feel great. My only complaint is the run a size too small. I should have ordered a extra large instead of a large.,4
B00W80Z87K,"They have been making underwater for a long time and mastered it, room in all the correct places and snug in all the correct places. Great price point, delivery was good, material seems very good as expected. Enough cotton to absorb sweat and holds it shape.",5
B00W80Z87K,"I've been wearing them for a while now, I'm talking MONTHS & all of them are uniform and QUALITY beaters. I'm definitely satisfied.  Sorry I didn't post pictures but they look exactly like the pictures. They aren't thin and they've held up really good with multiple, multiple washes. I still have 3 in the pack because I don't need to wear all 6 at once.. Great purchase.",5
B00W80Z87K,True to the size,5
B00W80Z87K,good quality,5
B00W80Z87K,I bought the value pack for my husband.  100% cotton. They fit just right,5
B00W80Z87K,It's ok but long I mean at my thigh,4
B00W80Z87K,Gave 4 stars due to  nearly all hv come undone at the shoulder seams  w/ reg. wash & use.,4
B00W80Z87K,Absolutely perfect fit as listed.,5
B00W80Z87K,Good weight. Great comfort. . Excellent sizing.,5
B00W80Z87K,"Size fits perfectly, comfortable, good value for the money",5
B00W80Z87K,Awesome,5
B00W80Z87K,Since I saw them I knew they would fix comfortable !!,5
B00W80Z87K,Size is really good material is amazing thickness exactly what I want it,5
B00W80Z87K,Very good,5
B00W80Z87K,"I bought these in a size bigger than I needed because I have to be able to step into them rather than put over my head. I'm having a double mastectomy soon and I won't be able to lift my arms for a while. These will work great and if I need to go out it'll be easy to just slip on a button shirt to wear over these T's. It's too bad they don't come in pink or light green or yellow but I'll make due with the assorted colors. I do wear them inside out due to the shoulder seams that my, apparently Princess and The Pea, shoulders find extremely annoying. If only they'd enclose the shoulder seam I'd be really happy. Oh... just remember I sew, like all the time. Maybe I'll fix the seams myself. It's still a suggestion for Fruit of The Loom.",4
B00W80Z87K,"Nice shirts, should've gotten an X large tho",5
B00W80Z87K,"Good product, flattering fit.",5
B00W80Z87K,True to size. Looks nice. Wearability is good. Not see through. Sturdy. Great to workout in.,5
B00W80Z87K,fits very great,5
B00W80Z87K,Name brand at bulk price,5
B00W80Z87K,Good quality could be softer.,4
B00W80Z87K,Im 350 5'11. Not bad I like them,5
B00W80Z87K,Order came fast! Shirts are nice quality. Would buy again!,5
B00W80Z87K,Great quality and fit!!,5
B00W80Z87K,Great fit,5
B00W80Z87K,I will be buying this product again!,5
B00W80Z87K,Excelente calidad y precio.,5
B00W80Z87K,Nice fit very comfortable.,5
B00W80Z87K,Originally bought mediums because that's my shirt size. I tried it on and it fit but was skin tight. I knew after a couple washes they would be un-wearable so I exchanged them for larges and they fit a lot more comfortably. Haven't washed them yet but don't expect them to shrink enough to not fit anymore.,4
B00W80Z87K,I like them for working out.Somehow the red and blue shirts have vanished though.,5
B00W80Z87K,"All the material that should have gone into the width went into the length instead. Stretchy enough that it still fits and serves the function of an undershirt, but an odd fit.",4
B00W80Z87K,Good,5
B00W80Z87K,"I had no idea that you could order A shirts from Fruit of the Loom bigger than 3XL so I was skeptical on what would show up. To my surprise,  they showed up. Fruit of the Loom brand big guy true 5XL A shirts. Wish the were seamless but not going to complain. . I probably could have went with the 4XL but then again I'm sure washing them will shrink em up some.",4
B07HC7SMCV,The comfort and fit..... The no slip bottoms.  The quality was very good as well.,5
B07HC7SMCV,"These are great socks, especially for travel, which is why I bought them.  They are synthetic and are about the same thickness as cotton blend crews.  I have some cotton crews, and these are similar in appearance, fit, comfort, and color (tan) as the cottons.  I took these on a vacation because they would dry after wearing and after a quick wash.",5
B07HC7SMCV,I was looking for a good pair of sox that could be worn with my over the calf riding boots because the leather in the boots was rubbing on my legs creating a blister. These sox were better than I expected not only do they come all the way up over the calf of my legs the foot and ancle area of the sox conforms perfectly with your feet by compressing around them making my feet very happy when I ware them.  Will be buying additional pairs again soon.  Loren,5
B07HC7SMCV,These socks are great. I waited to write a review to see how they last. Been almost six months and socks are in brand new condition still. Very comfy and durable. Would definitely recommend and will be buying more.,5
B07HC7SMCV,These socks are very comfortable and they feel much better than than the ones I was using.  They are well made and they will stay up and not slide down toward your ankle.,5
B07HC7SMCV,"These socks wick moisture very well - they do run a bit snug (I bought the size recommended for me by Amazon, they were compression-socks tight).EDIT: I'm changing my review, because the pilled fabric I'd found on them came off of the shoes I was wearing rather than the socks.",4
B07HC7SMCV,Great fit and they feel comfortable on my feet all day long,5
B07HC7SMCV,"Best socks ever, hands down.",5
B07HC7SMCV,Great quality,5
B07HC7SMCV,I am impressed with quality. Very stretchy.  They are slightly heavier than a dress sock. Comparable to some Under Armor crew socks I had purchased in the past.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Most comfortable,5
B07HC7SMCV,Awesome,5
B07HC7SMCV,Very Comfortable,5
B07HC7SMCV,Best socks I've ever purchased.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Super nice fit for my legs and feet,5
B07HC7SMCV,These by far the best socks I ever had keep your  feet  dry and very comfortable,5
B07HC7SMCV,"I purchased these for my husband as a gift. He requested these socks specifically for working outdoors. Most of his other socks wear out quickly, but he has had some like these for 6 months and they are still going strong, so he wanted more.",5
B07HC7SMCV,Awesome,5
B07HC7SMCV,Great so far.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Like them purchased more then once!,5
B07HC7SMCV,Comfortable,5
B07HC7SMCV,Very comfortable socks,5
B07HC7SMCV,,5
B07HC7SMCV,"These have been one of the best socks for comfort and fit I have ever had. After a couple of weeks of having them, I just ordered a second set to have.",5
B07HC7SMCV,"Nice, thick socks that will keep your feet warm. Very satisfied.",5
B07HC7SMCV,I bought these socks for my son as a Christmas present. He really likes the fit and feel with his work boots.,5
B07HC7SMCV,My husband absolutely loves these socks !! He said they are the most warm comfortable socks he has ever had,5
B07HC7SMCV,"These socks are tightly woven with a knit sole, toe, and heel in a different fabric knit and color. These socks do not appear to be reinforced but should meet everyday needs and keep feet warm in the upper South. Value for the money appears to be acceptable.",5
B07HC7SMCV,Main reason I tried these socks was - I hate when socks cut off circulation due to elastic at topthese socks have even snugness in leg portion to not slide down but not so much as to cut off blood flow,5
B07HC7SMCV,Husband loves them,5
B07HC7SMCV,They are lighter than most of my socks. But they keep my feet warm,5
B07HC7SMCV,Added comfort when wearing steel toe boots,5
B07HC7SMCV,Great value for the money. Very durable and comfortable to eat,4
B07HC7SMCV,Nice and long..Needed for work purposes.Comfortable,4
B07HC7SMCV,These are my go-to  cotton-blend daily wear socks. We wear socks in the house year round in our cold climate home. For me these socks fit the bill year round till it  get's super cold outside and then I'll wear something warmer in the house. 80%-90% of the year these aptyids in this color are my favorite. For some reason they seem to last longer before wearing through than the light gray and white aptyids. Really glad to have these as an option.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Very comfortable seem to be made of good quality.  Will see how long they last.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Great material for great price.,5
B07HC7SMCV,"I ordered size 9-12 men's for my son, but they did not fit.  They were to small.  My daughter asked if she could keep them, she has a smaller foot.  Was disappointed.",3
B07HC7SMCV,"I've been going through work boot inserts and not liking any of them. I thought that my feet were just too sensitive. But then I thought I would try the socks so I bought one pack. I'm so glad that I did. They don't have such a big cushion but it's extremely noticeable but it makes wearing uncomfortable work boots so much better. It's a difference that you won't believe. It ended up buying two more packs of these and replacing all of the socks in my sock drawer with these. No matter if it's work or play these are the socks that I want on my feet. They are so comfortable and they have a little bit of extra material I guess, at the bottom, whatever it is it works. Thank you",5
B07HC7SMCV,"My boyfriend needed new socks for work that he can wear in his work boots. He loves these and said they are very comfy and high quality for the price. For someone who years through socks, should last him a very long time. Great price for the value and they fit him perfectly.",5
B07HC7SMCV,fit great,5
B07HC7SMCV,They serve the purpose but fall down.,3
B07HC7SMCV,Does exactly as said,4
B07HC7SMCV,real good quality.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Socks fit nicely and very warm,5
B07HC7SMCV,"These socks are snug and have good stretch.They wick away sweat we'll and stay in place through the work day.I've owned these socks in several colors over the last year and have no issues.Quality work socks for any adult, I would recommend.",4
B07HC7SMCV,My husband was a die hard Carhart sock lover. Well these new ones I found are a game changer for him. These are the only socks he will wear to work in now and they are cheaper than the other brand!!,5
B07HC7SMCV,These socks are amazing not only comfortable but soft and warm !!,5
B07HC7SMCV,Great,5
B07HC7SMCV,I thought these were way too small for size large when I looked at them.  But they are very stretchy when pulled on.  A little thinner than I thought they would be and shoes feel a bit looser with these socks.  First use for these so will have to see how long they last.,4
B07HC7SMCV,To tight.,3
B07HC7SMCV,These don't smell bad after working all day in them I was curious because alot of posts say they fell apart so I wore them for 7 days straight they didn't smell or rip honestly for socks I like them they hold up well I've had them for a few months and no rips or tears just good socks,4
B07HC7SMCV,My son said they were the most comfortable socks,5
B07HC7SMCV,"Wear well, perfect elasticity. No issues with moisture, plenty of airflow. These became my go to.",5
B07HC7SMCV,"Very comfortable socks, priced right, and good value.",5
B07HC7SMCV,"I recently purchased the APTYID Men's Moisture Wicking Cushioned Crew Work Boot Socks, and I am thrilled with my experience. These socks have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, quality, and performance.The moisture-wicking feature works like a charm, keeping my feet dry and comfortable all day long, even during strenuous work activities. The cushioned design provides excellent support and padding, making these socks a joy to wear in work boots for extended periods.I appreciate the durability of these socks; they have held up well to frequent washing and wear without losing their shape or cushioning. The crew length is just right, providing ample coverage and protection.Overall, I highly recommend the APTYID Men's Moisture Wicking Cushioned Crew Work Boot Socks to anyone in need of high-quality, comfortable socks for work or everyday wear. They truly deserve a 5-star rating for their outstanding performance and comfort.",5
B07HC7SMCV,What I ordered,4
B07HC7SMCV,I thought they would be warmer than they are! Almost like a Dress Sock to me:-(,3
B07HC7SMCV,"These socks are amazing!My husband went through others so fast... holes and elastic stretched out fast....not these! They stay up and keep their shape. He's a logger and seriously puts them to the test everyday. Then l put them through a 70 minute,  hot water washing. These are the best! Thank you!",5
B07HC7SMCV,"Comfortable Fit, and not as bulky as some boot socks",5
B07HC7SMCV,"They feel great but after just a couple months half of them have holes in them, but they are sufficiently cheap enough it's not that big of a deal.",3
B07HC7SMCV,"Disliked, not as soft as I thought they were..",3
B07HC7SMCV,Great socks and great quality. They are durable and wash up good! True to size and do not shrink! They keep his feet warm and dry.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Good Quality great cushioning,5
B07HC7SMCV,Comfortable and soft. He loves them. Brand new. Will update if they don't last long.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Perfect fit and just thick enough to use in boots and shoes!!!,5
B07HC7SMCV,"Maybe 6 mos ago I bought 6 pair aptyd sox and 6 pair adidas sox (for more money). So far I've thrown away 2 asidas sox due to holes in the toe. The aptyd are still fine, as they should be. I just replaced my  Adidas with Aptyd's.",5
B07HC7SMCV,"Good fit, decent thickness. Looks nice but not fancy",5
B07HC7SMCV,These are my favorite work socks. They keep me dry and comfortable all day long. Great price for solid product.,4
B07HC7SMCV,"I bought these based on the reviews regarding the moisture wicking capabilities of these socks.  I've been wearing them for about a week now and my experience has been that they leave my toes too damp for my liking.  For many years, I always wore only Hanes X-Temp socks and never had any issues.  These APTYID socks are not the same... I'm guessing it has to do with the difference in materials... Hanes are cotton based while these are a synthetic mix.  And lest you think that I'm wearing non-breathable tight boots for 14 hours a day... I work from home and wear clogs in my house the entire day and still get the dampness.  Even more so when I wear sneakers or other shoes when I go out.  I also detected an odor in my sneakers and on the socks when I remove them at the end of the day, which I never had before.On a positive note, the socks are very soft and fit very comfortably.  I saw one reviewer say that they were constantly slipping down his calf... that has not happened to me at all.  They stay up consistently.  The one thing I hate about the Hanes is that they leave a ton of lint on your feet/toes and it takes many months of laundry cycles till that tapers off.  These APTYID's leave no lint at all.  Some reviewers were saying that these socks are very thin and I was nervous they would be dress sock thin, but that is not at all the case... The thickness was just right.",3
B07HC7SMCV,I bought these for my son. He asked for comfortable breathable socks. He does a lot of walking. He wanted them to be a moderate length but not too tall. He was pleased with them.,5
B07HC7SMCV,My husband loves these socks. He wears work boots to work every day and they last without holes for a long time,5
B07HC7SMCV,Extremely comfortable. Do not cut off circulation.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Snug and comfy with great cushion. Love em!,5
B07HC7SMCV,I dont do reviews often and its unusual to be very happy with socks which are alittle pricey but well worth it. These stand up so well. They go on easy and stay in place which are my personal preference and guide to a good sock. As well as I use these for work and dress. They havent had threads coming loose causing holes in my toes which I had problems with others in work boots. So I say you cant go wrong when purchasing these. I have purchased 2 times.,5
B07HC7SMCV,These socks are very comfortable to wear. Sizing is correct and not too tight. Will have to see about durability over time. Good quality socks.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Definitely have better socks but these get the job done,4
B07HC7SMCV,Great,5
B07HC7SMCV,"Purchased to replace some old stretched work boot socks.  No complaints at all, the fit is good, they're comfortable and they don't fall down after a long day.",5
B07HC7SMCV,They not only are comfortable but they fit very well.,5
B07HC7SMCV,Perfect for my new work boots....,5
B07HC7SMCV,Fast delivery good socks,5
B07HC7SMCV,"I work in a warehouse, on my feet 9 plus hours. No new blisters, no more old ones and no sweaty feet either. Liked them so much I bought a 2nd pack !!",5
B08YHLVJN3,"Very comfortable. Perfect for my outdoor workouts during the colder months. They aren't super warm but better than leggings which is perfect for me because I get overheated easily. Love the price and the color of the dufflebag green. I got the sweatshirt and zip up hoodie to match and they're consistent with the coloring. There are some threads hanging off the bottom hem of the pants after washing them once so the quality is somewhat questionable. Pockets are deep! I ordered a medium even though the suggested size on Amazon was a small (I haven't been a small pant in years lol) and honestly the medium is a bit tighter than I would like. The mediums fit, but I like a slightly baggy look and these don't do that. I'm 5'6 and 150lbs for reference. Thicker thighs and bottom which fill up the mediums to look more fitted but there's stretch, like it doesn't feel too tight. I think I'll order a large just for personal preference though.",4
B08YHLVJN3,"Purchased for my grandfather after he had not one but 3 strokes. He struggled with his zipper and buttons on his regular pants. These have a comfortable elastic waist and string to tie to keep them snug or fitting. Soft cotton fabric and are warm for the winter. They're also fairly versatile so he can wear tshirts, sweatshirts, etc with them. Very happy with the quality and value.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"These pants appear to be well-made: The fabric is soft and appears to be of good quality. They washed (in cold water), and dried fine. They're fairly warm, although one would not want to go out into snow with them. The worst thing about them is the fit: I purchased a M for my friend which were too big. I then purchased the S, and again too big. He's not a large person, but I guess you would have to buy from the teen boys' department to get a Small that fits. The pockets (which I think most men prefer having pockets), are of average depth. The drawstring I thought is kind of strange in that it is a continuous piece - not a piece with two ends to tie together; also it's inside the pants which is a preference for some. The pockets do cause the pants to poonch out around the belly, but I don't think that's a game-changer with these because they don't appear to be intended for wearing to dress-up. Ultimately, they seem to be a good buy because Fruit of the Loom has always made quality products, and I think the price is so low because I don't think they will be offering this line of apparel anymore. I would say ""buy"" if you just want knock-abouts because the price is so good.",3
B08YHLVJN3,"I got these in a size medium and it fits with no problems. There are stitched cuffs at the bottom and there was no sag from my waist down. For reference, I am more than 5 foot 6 inches and the cutoff for the pants is about where my ankles are. These pants come with drawstrings and deep pockets. The color of the pants is a very light gray but not a true gray and goes well with any color shirt I have. Highly recommend this one.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"Well, I am back again. I purchased another sweatshirt with the matching sweat paints. Originally wanted to go with the Orange. Unfortunately, only the sweat shirt came in that color. So, I decided on red. If I can't look like a traffic cone, I can look like a Stop sign.I have read a few negative reviews. Fortunately, I have not experienced holes or loose threads. I have washed my maroon sweat outfit (shirt/ pants five times so far. It didn't fall apart as one reviewer had documented. Even though these garments are 60/40, I have noticed a slight shrinkage. I wash my clothes in warm water, and dry on Delicate with steam. Which means, do not use high heat.I get shivers up my spine when I gave the negative reviews a second look. The tearing, pocket seams come unraveled. The first thing that comes to mind about splitting seams"", is the garment washing technique being implemented. This means, possibly overstuffing the washing machine. This would causes any garment to tear. Don't forget fabric is at its weakness when wet. Years ago, when I used to go to the laundry Matt, I saw how people would stuff the washers (Top and Front loaders). Stands to reason why items did not get cleaned, and buttons would fall off, and seams would come apart. Unnecessary stress to the steams.Pockets. Yes, I agree that a thicker material could have been used, but that is simply not the case. So the question is, what is being placed in the pockets? Heavy mental items? Keys for instance. Bulky item that are causing stress to the seams????? Or could it be the wrong size sweat pants were purchased. Think about it. Tight paints, and trying to fill pockets is a no no.I have a very dear friend that is now in a power chair. He is parabolized from the chest down. He encounters great difficulty when putting  on his sweat pants.  Tugging, pulling, and yet the sweat shirt and pants have not come apart yet. Since I do his laundry, I wash on warm, tumble dry low. I don't experience any fading or shrinking.A few weeks ago, I purchased the same sweat pants and sweat shirt. Really comfy! So, I thought I'd buy two more sets and give them has a stocking stuffer.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"I loved these pants when I got them, and I got four pairs of black.  Until I put them in my washing machine, all four of them inside out, so that the lint could wash out from the inside.  (inexpensive sweat pants have this lint that falls off)  The first problem was that the pants were so heavy when soaked up with water, that the washing machine took twenty minutes to spin instead of four: they were just clunking around heavy in the circle and not rinsing properly.  Then I had one pair of black that I washed with some other clothes, and everything took on the black color -- my white cotton socks all turned grey.  This was very sad because I really really liked these pants in every way: soft enough to sleep in, stylish enough to wear outside to the store, or anywhere.  Oh well.  So I returned them, and ordered some light Khaki Heather ones, two pairs medium, but they were never shipped, and a note on my phone said they could not be shipped because they don't take gift cards.  But the only size they have which ship quickly (not the 7 days of the other ones) were sized large and small, which I went ahead and ordered anyway: I will see if I can wear them, if not I will have to return them.  I'm really waiting for the medium ones, in beige heather, and repeated the order, and am waiting to see if they will ship.  The medium size ships a week later; the other sizes seem to be from a different place and ship overnight like they are supposed too.Update:  I easily got a refund for all the black ones I returned, and my second order of Khaki Heather LARGE ones arrived: (I returned the SMALL as they were child-sized) I laundered them and the light color didn't ruin anything in the wash.  They are soft and comfortable, so nice, so I ordered 4 more of the Khaki Heather Large.  I love the light color.  They are long, but the elastic bottoms prevent the pants for sliding down and touching the floor.  The elastic bottoms are very gentle, you don't feel them at all.  These are the most comfortable sweats I have ever had, they are good to wear inside and out for errands, which I can not say about my other sweats.  I will order even more pairs. They do not shrink in the wash (maybe a tad only, but that's good), and as the color is Khaki Heather, the color does not ruin everything in the wash.  The black ones are the best, but be forewarned that you must launder them only with all other completely black clothes or towels.  If they are not good at first, they are very easy to return, and then order a size up or down.",4
B08YHLVJN3,"Exactly what I was looking for. Sweat pants with an elastic waist band that is enough to hold them up. No need for the annoying cord (It is present in case someone needs it. ) I am usually men size L, but for those size M did the trick. Simple design, decently sized pockets (no zippers to poke you).",5
B08YHLVJN3,"It's winter now, and I hibernate this time of year... So, I really wanted some nice thick and comfy pants to wear around the house. I wasn't sure which pair to get after looking at tons of pants online, so I got these, and I am very pleased with them. They are perfect for doing things around the house, and yes, you could wear them anywhere. They are good quality, and the elastic around the waist and ankles is comfortable. It's thick enough without being too hot, just nice and cozy. They are helpful when picking things up, getting up and down, and you can nap in them, too. They are very cozy, with nice deep pockets, and I am loving them right now. I am 5'5"", 180 pounds, and got the XXL. I love them.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"For excersize, these are great for intense movement - like a second skin, they are light enough not to encumber running, weightlifting, any sport with large moves. Remind me of the gym clothes of the late 70s that did the job. They still do.",5
B08YHLVJN3,I buy these mens pants because they are comfortable and inexpensive. I usually ruin them by working in them so I just buy more. The price is right ! The pants look good.,5
B08YHLVJN3,Well made for $10 sweatpants but don't expect great styling or fancy fabric.  Fit is fairly baggy.,4
B08YHLVJN3,"My husband always wants to be comfortable.  He liked the quality of the material, fit, size and pockets.  It looks good on him.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"I buy a mens size medium for my 13 year old.  He's about 5'6"" 140 pounds. So far I bought them 3/4 times now in black, gray and dark gray.  The pockets are a plus because I made the mistake of buying a pr without and he was not happy. They have white draw string at the waste and they're sewed at the bottom.",4
B08YHLVJN3,"Just because fruit of the loom is inexpensive,don't go to something more expensive. Fruit of the Loom has never let me down to keep me warm.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"Husband loves them, great for every day ware and sleep. Pockets are deep enough. Great wash and wear fabric",5
B08YHLVJN3,My husband loved these sweatpants. He said that they were very comfortable and the fit was just right.,5
B08YHLVJN3,Ok,4
B08YHLVJN3,Love the pants on these rare chilly morning hear in South Florida when I have to walk my dog!I would have perferred a better tight system besides the string and strong elastic in waist band to keep the pants tight!,5
B08YHLVJN3,"Very comfortable vibrant color,holds up through wash and dry cycle no shrinkage or fading. I 100% recommend.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"These sweats are a good deal for the price. They are long enough for a >6' tall man, comfortable and warm. Unfortunately, we had to return them for a larger (overall) size and are awaiting that package. I'm sure the new order will fit just fine!  Same item, different color, but review is the same.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"These are very soft.  The label shows that they are 60% cotton.  I am 6' tall and have a 29"" waist.  I got the small, which fits perfectly in the waist, but are slightly long for my height.  I'm okay with it, but if you are shorter, it could be a problem.  I don't like elastic bottoms, so I plan to cut that off anyway.I took off one star for fit.  These are just a box sewn together.  They have no shape.  No attempt was made to make them fit a man's body.  They are mostly comfortable, but the cut is very unattractive and I certainly wouldn't wear them in public.  Also, they slide down your butt in the back every time you bend over.  This is because of the poor shape and high crotch.The pockets are big enough for the largest cell phone to fit comfortably.",4
B08YHLVJN3,"These sweats are some of the most comfortable warm and best fitting sweats all time. However, this pair, after one wash ripped in the rear inseam, kinda of bummed! Still a Fruit of the Loom fan though.",5
B08YHLVJN3,Fits comfortable.,4
B08YHLVJN3,"Good sweats,  I usually order small but ordered medium for a more comfortable fit.",5
B08YHLVJN3,These medium-weight sweatpants are just right for my moderate winter months  The size chart guided me to a perfect size  I appreciate the affordable price. I purchased 2 top and bottom sets for me and 2 for my husband. We both like them,5
B08YHLVJN3,"This is my second pair of Fruit of The Loom sweatpants. I liked the first pair so much that I've worn them until they were falling apart. Just got my second pair. As soon as I slid my legs in, I could feel how soft they are. Wow. Sure, that softness will fade over time and multiple washings but right now ? Heaven !",5
B08YHLVJN3,These sweats are comfortable and keep you warm. The only drawback is that the inner lining sheds a bit the first few uses,4
B08YHLVJN3,Just not long enough and I'm short,4
B08YHLVJN3,I've been losing weight and was concerned what would fit properly. I  am pleased with this purchase. I don't usually wear sweats living in S. Florida but with this unusual cold weather I am happy I bought these. They are warm and feel good.,5
B08YHLVJN3,"I love them, but the quality could be better. They wear out pretty fast.",4
B08YHLVJN3,Fit as expected and love the elastic cuff. Great value too!,5
B08YHLVJN3,As described. Cheap but adequate. Shrinkage will take it down a size.,4
B08YHLVJN3,"so i wanted a thin fleece sweatpant. i got lucky as these are pretty thin and not too warm. as with almost all sweatpants the elastic band on the waist is disappointingly weak, so i have to use the drawstrings",4
B08YHLVJN3,"As someone who is vastly overweight looking at pants online is a gamble. I always go a size or 2 over because im short with bigger hips and thighs. These pants run bigger than normal, doesnt 'hug' at all in the thigh area. Very comfy, deep pockets, didnt shrink with a quick rinse.One downside would be the drawstring is meh.For how cheap these are im very satisfied with this purchase. Be sure not to overestimate the size on this, I could fit comfortably into a size XL.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"These are super soft and fit very well. If anything, they may run a bit larger, but I think with sweats that is perfect! Got these for my hubby after his neck surgery and that way he could put them on even if I wasn't home and he loves them. For the price you can't go wrong. I got three colors!",5
B08YHLVJN3,"They wear well.  Most important, they havepockets.  Who would make sweats withoutthem?",5
B08YHLVJN3,I like these cause they have pockets n I love the fit not baggy but comfortable,5
B08YHLVJN3,"Hello.I have received purchased item. Everything is top notch. I would like to praise your prompt customer support, packing job, your prompt shipping and high quality of received item. I am super happy. I just left you a positive feedback with 5 stars for all DSR lines. I hope we can do business in the future.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"I ordered a black pair, a red pair and a gray pair and they are all good quality except the black pair which are thinner than the rest.",4
B08YHLVJN3,Very comfortable and the draw string made it simple to loosen or tighten.,4
B08YHLVJN3,I thought the material would be heavier. Just a little thin. Pockets are nice.,4
B08YHLVJN3,"Everything is good, except the elastic breaks down and looses hold...",4
B08YHLVJN3,Very soft and great comfortable fit. I just ordered one to try it out and love it.,5
B08YHLVJN3,"True to size, comfortable, live that they have pockets",5
B08YHLVJN3,Comfortable and relaxed design. Decent fit. Weird pockets tho,4
B08YHLVJN3,"My?Boyfriend is such A. Tiny little thing. So I bought him something to keep him warm. Bought him a Tupac, ugly sweats. And he loves them",5
B08YHLVJN3,This is the fourth pair we have ordered. True to size. Washes up nicely.,5
B08YHLVJN3,My husband ordered several pair. They are good quality and very affordable. He likes the elastic bottom and that they are not tight joggers.,5
B08YHLVJN3,Worked for me and would buy again.,5
B08YHLVJN3,they are great I love them,5
B08YHLVJN3,"Ordered these for my son for Christmas. He pretty much only comes out of them so I can wash them. They fit according to size, and he loves how soft and warm they are.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"Arrived quickly, item was as described.  Soft inner lining with elastic bottoms on the legs.  The color was accurate.  Tip:  wash inside out in cold water to get a good fit with minimal shrinkage.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"Waffle style Thermals, no pockets",5
B08YHLVJN3,I love how soft these are and the pockets are deep enough for me to put my phone in without worrying it will fall out. They are made from good quality fabric and are very comfortable. The only problem is they shrunk when I washed them. The black ones bleed when I washed them so it's color catches or wash with only black items.,4
B08YHLVJN3,3xl is the perfect size.,4
B08YHLVJN3,super soft and  super  comfortable to wear.,5
B08YHLVJN3,Nice and comfortable fits perfect.,5
B08YHLVJN3,Nice soft and warm,5
B08YHLVJN3,"Good quality, nice fit.",5
B08YHLVJN3,Super comfortable.,5
B08YHLVJN3,As advertised,5
B08YHLVJN3,Great fit,5
B08YHLVJN3,"Nice lightweight jogging pants.  Can be used for sleeping, exercise.  Material nice for lightweight joggers.  Wash and dry good.",4
B08YHLVJN3,As described,5
B08YHLVJN3,I loved this I ordered the zip up as well. I would size down as they run a little big,4
B08YHLVJN3,My new favorite brand and sweatpant. Feels so comfy,5
B08YHLVJN3,Just as described!,5
B08YHLVJN3,"Good price and product, and came from USA so I would buy again from this seller, thank you Amazon.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"These sweatpants look good on a teen who is very picky about what he wears. They are not like most sweatpants, but a little bit more dressy. My teen loves his pair, and they are warm enough to wear in Michigan winters.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"He loves these - not too heavy, fit nicely and have deep pockets.",5
B08YHLVJN3,I've had the tie strings break on two pair of these simply from bending over.  After that they're not repairable. Not the traditional design that the string is inserted and runs all the way through to the other end. Each end of the string is sewn in at the back of the pants and is a loop in the front. I really like the sweats but when the string breaks you might as well order another pair unless you want to use a belt to keep them up.,4
B08YHLVJN3,cotton sweatpants should be very comfortable. Available pockets and a closure string to tie your pants. Polyester woven into the fabric adds to durability.,5
B08YHLVJN3,good sweats,4
B08YHLVJN3,"The pocket tore after a few washes in one pair, but it the others. I'm satisfied.",4
B08YHLVJN3,"The jacket is perfectly sized and keeps you away from air, rain or snow. The fur on the inside keeps you very warm. Best deal for the money",5
B08YHLVJN3,nice,5
B08YHLVJN3,Runs large,5
B08YHLVJN3,Good,5
B08YHLVJN3,Good quality i work in them and they hold up Good for the price.,4
B08YHLVJN3,"Bought for son, he loved them. Raved how comfortable they were.",5
B08YHLVJN3,"Warm and heavy, soft. Nice material a little disappointed in the sewing. Things definitely are not made like they use to be. Washes well. Reasonably priced.",4
B08YHLVJN3,So soft and comfortable,4
B08YHLVJN3,"For the price is good, for us larger than expected, if these are 2x i could've worn an xl.",4
B0929CZSL2,"Perfect fit, keeps my feet warm even when it 20 degrees outside and their not to thick.  Seems to be made of high quality material.  I'd buy again.",5
B0929CZSL2,"DURABLE, WASHES WELL, COMFORTABLE, MEDIUM CUSHION & COMPRESSION, NEUTRAL COLOR, THICK, YET NOT EXCESSIVELY BULKY... BUT NOT QUITE AS ""BREATHABLE"" AS THEY USED TO BE.I bought these socks a little over a year ago and they were PERFECT for keeping my feet warm and comfy in during the cold winter.  I wanted to buy more so I looked thru my previous orders to ensure I picked the same item and size to buy.  The new socks I received are just slightly lighter in color on the outside and mostly white on the inside (as opposed to the mostly gray inside color of the older ones).  The new ones also feel ""stuffier.""  They're still soft and keep my feet very warm, but they're not as breathable as the ones I previously bought.  Sometimes, I have to take them off while lounging around the house because they make my feet so sweaty.  The older ones never (and still don't) make my feet sweat.  I think the company may have changed the fiber content or ratio.I would buy these socks again.  But I wouldn't pay $19.99 for a set of 3 pairs again.  I was willing to pay that much for the quality of the first set of socks I received.  Now I wouldn't pay more than $10 given the reduced breathability of the last set I received.  I'd recommend buying these when they're on sale.  (I don't usually have a problem with my feet sweating.  If you do, then I'd recommend you really whether these socks will be tolerable for you.)The size chart seems true to size.My shoe size is 8.5 in US Womens.  Both times I bought these socks in size S-M.  Both times, they fit very well.These socks fit snug on my feet and usually stay pretty snug after an entire day of walking around.  They don't ever stretch out to the point of bunching up or twisting around.  However, they do loosen up quite a bit if I've been running around in them on carpet (without shoes) most of the day.  I've gotten away with wearing a pair 2 days in a row (taking them off while sleeping at night).  They were still comfy, but by the end of the 2nd day, they were just loose enough for me to not try wearing them 1 more day.They wash well.  I didn't follow the instructions.  I just threw them in the washer and dryer (room temp water and low heat).  They visibly shrank a lot, but still fit fine when I put them on.  They were just a bit shorter.  I actually liked that they were more snug after washing.  (Note:  They fit well when wearing before and after laundering.  I see no need to size up or down unless you're in between sizes... prefer to wear your socks a certain way... or have special considerations like very wide or very narrow feet.)These socks provide adequate cushion and compression on my feet.  I have high arches and the heels & balls of my feet are usually sore if I wear poor quality socks.  These actually help relieve some end-of-day aching.  There aren't really any parts that feel uncomfortable... unless I put the sock on pretty crooked.  Then I can feel a small seam that's supposed to sit unnoticably above your toes.  (But that's a user error.) The socks are lightweight, considering how much warmth they provide.  They have a little bulk to them, but are still comfortable to wear with lined winter boots.  (Some socks are so bulky they cause my feet to go numb.  These don't.)  The socks work well for hiking in cold weather or when you know you're going to be on your feet all day.DURABLE: I wear these socks a lot... almost year round.  My toes and part of my feet tend to change colors and even go numb in slightly chilly temperatures... even due to the indoor air conditioner being set a little too low.  The ones I bought over a year ago still wear well despite repeated machine washing & drying.  They've started to acquire some fuzz balls or pilling at the heels and tips of my toes, but that's about it.  I've mostly been using the newer ones lately to see if there are any ""wear"" issues.  So far, they're holding up very well to very frequent washing & wearing.",4
B0929CZSL2,Did the dryer for 15 minutes and it did help.  Wore them on a motorcycle ride and for the first time my feet were freezing.  These are not crazy thick but they are so much better than traditional athletic socks.  Soft and fluffy.  Glad I got them and will wear them all winter!,5
B0929CZSL2,These socks were great for my ski trip. They are super thick so if ice got in my shoes my feet still would not get wet. They are also great if you are a blue collar worker who works outside. Will keep your feet very warm and the thickness helps comfort your feet while being on them all day. Both women and men would love these socks.,5
B0929CZSL2,I bought these as I live in Minnesota and my feet are always cold this time of year.  These socks feel great and keep my feet toasty warm. They are super soft and comfortable. They stretch well and fit nicely.  Absolutely worth it!,5
B0929CZSL2,My son works in a refrigerated setting and needed some warmer socks. I got these for him and he says they make a world of difference for him. I got a second set in case he runs out. They've held up well and still keep him warm despite being washed and dried. He may ask for more in the future because they're that awesome! I'm glad I found socks at a good price point that work and won't break the bank!,5
B0929CZSL2,My hubby always complains his feet are cold. I got him these socks and have not heard a complaint yet except when he has forgotten to put them on. Which is all his fault. He said the socks cushion his feet. They are nice and thick and keep his feet nice and warm.The colors are just right for him. He has been walking barefoot  in the socks and there is no damage. Very durable socks. Great value for your money.,5
B0929CZSL2,"I was wearing my previous worn out merino wool socks when these arrived.  It says to fluff them on the dryer to decompress for 15 minutes.  Another review said the quality was less than last time they bought them but they feel great to me.  I let out an audible ""ah"" as I slid my foot in.  Got the XL socks, which says 14-16 on back of the package, but my foot is 12.5 to 13 and this feels like the first time I've had a pair of socks that fit my feet.",5
B0929CZSL2,"I opened them up, washed and dried them. They were warm and cozy. Sadly, as they were worn, my feet became more and more moist until they were nearly soaked at the end of the day. Not sure why as I don'tget that from merino wool generally. I'll buy something else henceforth.",4
B0929CZSL2,"My 1st pair that I bought were a little small, so I gave them to my wife. I really like these socks. They are warm and stay in place. They 1st pair was a s/m and I reordered the m/l and I wear a size 9 boot.",5
B0929CZSL2,"My fingers and toes can't tolerate the cold. I finally broke down and bought battery-operated heated gloves and they're a lifesaver for my Raynaud's.  I own two pairs of Merino wool socks, but these are even better.  I love the extra lining!  My toes still get cold, but it has been single digits here lately. Probably the best socks one can buy without going the battery-operated heated route.",5
B0929CZSL2,"By far and away the best winter socks, to wear in boots, hiking shoes, etc. that i have ever purchased! They are amazing when they come out of the dryer!",5
B0929CZSL2,Great winter sock.  Warm and well made can be washed and dried with normal laundry.  Order a size larger than normal.,5
B0929CZSL2,Got these for my son who works outside in the cold. He says they work great and his feet stay warm,5
B0929CZSL2,"These are definitely my favorite socks right now. I suffer from chronically cold feet when I go camping, but I wore these and nothing else on my feet and for the first time I think I stayed warm, even in the snow.",5
B0929CZSL2,These socks are absolutely amazing and warm! My feet had been cold all winter until I purchased these socks and started wearing them.,5
B0929CZSL2,"Product and it's delivery was as described.  Well made socks, very warm, excellent value.  Would purchase again.",5
B0929CZSL2,Keeps my feet warm which I love since they are always cold,4
B0929CZSL2,These socks are amazing! And so so soft. But most importantly they do the job of keeping you warm. I live where winter are sub zero temps. They work. Got a pair for the family they all say keeps their feet cozy. I will be buying more.,5
B0929CZSL2,"I never write reviews, these are the darndest things. They come compressed in the package with instructions to turn them inside out and put in the dryer.  Wa-La.......instant comfy warm winter socks. Not sure where they are made (the say Made in the USA or Imported), but every word I see on the package seems to be written in American English only. Of course, they could be pulling the ""wool"" over our eyes (Yuk Yuk). For the price, you have to try them.",5
B0929CZSL2,I love these for my trips to Vermont and for winter golf!!!! Awesome!!,5
B0929CZSL2,Everything was as described! Good pair of wool sox!! Will buy again!!,5
B0929CZSL2,"These are for my husband's birthday. He loves them, they soft and comfortable.",5
B0929CZSL2,"I am of the age where cold feet at night is a SERIOUS concern.  Do NOT like it.  These are soft, VERY comfortable, and keep my feet as warm as I would wish.  True, I am in central Texas, so extreme below 0 temps are not a concern, but still, I want to be cozy.",5
B0929CZSL2,"The socks arrived quickly, they fit and are comfortable.",4
B0929CZSL2,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He works in the postal service and has to deliver in some horribly cold conditions. I bought some as a test first to see if they fit, second to see if they were going to be able to handle his job and the cold.He loves them! So much so that I bought two sets of them.All pros, no cons.* Warm* Soft and comfortable* Come in dark tones for uniform requirementsNote: I bought one size up to be on the safe side. They fit perfectly.",5
B0929CZSL2,I wear a men's 8.5 or a 9 and these fit perfect. They are snug but not tight. Since it has been a bit cold hear I have been wearing these daily. They don't itch and are comfortable.,4
B0929CZSL2,"These socks are warm, but a little tight at the top, not good for diabetics.",4
B0929CZSL2,They look great.  Excellent material. Keeps the feet warm  l like them . They are thick and washable,5
B0929CZSL2,"It really warmed my feet. I work in seafood processing plant, where the room temperature is about 38 degrees F. As I started wearing these thermal socks, I felt warmer and no more running nose while working. These cocks are not too thick, and the right cushions on m to feet.",5
B0929CZSL2,"I'm going to buy more. Not only when you're in your house and your feet are cold, they keep them warm. Working outside in 20 degree weather, feet are still warm.",5
B0929CZSL2,Bought for a trip up north (-20 temps for the high) and they were perfect. Kept feet warm and dry the whole time.,5
B0929CZSL2,As advertised,5
B0929CZSL2,Comfortable and warm! Will absolutely buy again!,5
B0929CZSL2,These are perhaps the warmest and softest wool soxs I've ever experienced. Excellent quality and very reasonably priced.,5
B0929CZSL2,Amazingly they come vacuumed sealed.  I put in the dryer to fluff them up and they feel really good and comfortable.  They are good to wear around the house because there is some thickness to them.,5
B0929CZSL2,What's to say? Their socks . They're keeping my son's feet warm he likes them very much,5

B0929CZSL2,Cold wet days in the work field these socks became the game changer,5
B0929CZSL2,These wool socks are nice and fluffy and warm. Exactly what I needed for these colder winter days. Wool beats out man made fibers every time for warmth and sweat wicking abilities. They even keep your feet warm if they get wet.,5
B0929CZSL2,Super thick warm socks! Amazing if you work outside or are going to be doing things outside in the cold!,5
B0929CZSL2,Warmest socks I own. My feet would get cold even sitting at home with my OLD socks. These are a game changer,5

B0929CZSL2,I gifted these socks to my brother who works outdoors in the winter.  He loves them!,5
B0929CZSL2,will buy again,5
B0929CZSL2,"I work outside in all weather from 2pm to 11pm. I do something similar to roadside assistance for local EMS.  Which means sometimes standing and working in slush puddles.  Lately it's been in the mid to low 30s at night. My current socks are wearing out and need replacement.  I used to get really nice thick warm WOOL socks from the local wholesale club, but they stopped carrying them.Yesterday it was in the low 40s during the day and low 30 at night. These are ok during the day but once night falls they are not very warm.  These are no where near as warm as my current worn out wool socks. Yes I wear a lot of wool in the winter. I also wear merino wool long johns. I like wool specifically because even when wet wool retains a lot of it's warming abilities. So when working in a slush puddle my feet stay warm enough. I don't think these have much wool in them.The last few months I've been trying to find replacements for what I used to get from the club. These aint them. These would probably be ok for a grocery run but working outside for several hours, No Not At All.",3
B0929CZSL2,Great product. Highly recommended great value for the money,5
B0929CZSL2,They are warm and ideal for this weather,5
B0929CZSL2,Para uso personal.,4
B0929CZSL2,"So far I have worn 2 of the 3 pair.  I have worn them on 2 very cold days while I was out walking.  They kept my feet warm and were so soft, I was able to walk a longer distance than I originally planned.  I would be happy to order these again.",5

B0929CZSL2,Bought these for my husband and he loves them! Soft and comfortable!,5
B0929CZSL2,"Socks were very warm, bought for my brother",5
B0929CZSL2,I wear these camping. They are so warm and comfortable. Not tight at all. Great thickness but still comfortable in my shoes. Stays up.,5
B0929CZSL2,These socks are really thick. May have to adjust shoe size,5
B0929CZSL2,Keeps my feet warm!,5
B0929CZSL2,"As described, seems like decent quality.",4
B0929CZSL2,These are quality socks. Thick and well made. I use them around the house with my RockDove memory foam slippers which I also highly recommend. I also use them when I go to the gym now that the weather is getting cold. So far they are holding up and that's with 30 min on the treadmill 3x a week.,5
B0929CZSL2,"Very warm socks, perfect for my daughter at college in 8 degree weather!",5
B0929CZSL2,Great value in warm winter socks.I'm very happy with them.  We'll see how they hold up thru many wash and wears in the future,5
B0929CZSL2,i love them,5
B0929CZSL2,This is only 3 pairs or socks. I think they are cheaper in other places. I thought it was 6 by the picture. The socks are ok. They don't make my feet sweat but they are medium warm.  Not thicker than i expected,4
B0929CZSL2,After washing they got thicker but still sodt enough. Will be comfortable with a looser boot or shoe.,5
B00HVVVMM6,The product fit nicely it looks sturdy and comfortable it covers the chest good and it is lightweight it is resistant  and covers.,5
B00HVVVMM6,I love it perfect fit feels good to the skin,5
B00HVVVMM6,"This undershirts do not irritate the skin. They fit well and wash well, and are very durable. I have been buying these for my son. They help keep his warm during the cold months. My 10 year old remembers to wear these every time he is dressing because they are so comfortable on the skin. The material is durable and washes well and holds up pretty good. I am very pleased with my purchase and I recommend.",5
B00HVVVMM6,"I saw there were ""long"" versions of these for sale so I avoided those to go for normal length ones. Gotta say..these are still pretty long..I'm fine with them, but it's not an ideal fit because I don't want my undershirts coming out from under my shirts. Fine if you're tucking in but otherwise I have to scrunch them up a bit..they're consistent and seem well enough made though",4
B00HVVVMM6,Good quantity and quality for the price. Great value. Comfortable and fit perfect.,5
B00HVVVMM6,gave away to my son,3
B00HVVVMM6,"I worked in a clinic and there was a dress code requiring moderately dressy clothing. A polo wasn't always ideal so button up dress shirts was often my go to. But t-shirts under a dress shirt on hot days was uncomfortable and there was a bit of translucency to the dress shirt. These came in very handy, they obscured the unsightly portions of my body, but allowed more breathability. They last me years if I wash them correctly.",5
B00HVVVMM6,I would recommend a size bigger,5
B00HVVVMM6,"I expected these tanks to be a lot smaller than they are and I was shocked by how long they are. However, even though the one's I bought were a size too big for me, it compressed down really well and the tank feels snug and tight.",4
B00HVVVMM6,I bought this as I was looking for something very comfortable to wear. The quality is very good and very comfortable to wear.,4
B00HVVVMM6,Exactly what I needed,5
B00HVVVMM6,Excellent,5
B00HVVVMM6,"I look these, good purchase, fast delivery",5

B00HVVVMM6,Great for the job.,5
B00HVVVMM6,"My son likes the tight fit and the softness. He normally wears a large, but we order a medium for these since they are used as an undershirt.",5
B00HVVVMM6,gift,5
B00HVVVMM6,It was just what he wanted,5
B00HVVVMM6,"I am a big guy 6'5"" 330lb and they fit me well they are long and fit nice and snug I ordered the 3xl",4
B00HVVVMM6,"Fits perfectly fine, loving them",4
B00HVVVMM6,Size is dead on. Does not shrink in the wash. Fabric is top quality. Super light weight. Very happy!,4
B00HVVVMM6,Great,5
B00HVVVMM6,I wear this in all my movie homes,4
B00HVVVMM6,Good quality,5
B00HVVVMM6,"This undershirt is the best I've ever had.  It can be worn as an undershirt and is very comfortable, but it can also be worn instead of those tight and ridiculous ""muscle shirts.""  It's very durable plus.",5
B00HVVVMM6,Fabric quality is good and comfortable,3
B00HVVVMM6,"I was expecting them to be thin haha but- WOAH they are thin. I think if I wear it under stuff it'll be fine though, I don't really wear them out by themselves anyway. Very good for the price",3
B00HVVVMM6,"Fits good, very comfortable",5
B00HVVVMM6,Product is great but a bit tight for my liking,4
B00HVVVMM6,"This used to be a reliable brand that I trusted but I purchased these and they tore & ripped quickly, I don't even know how. I am going to order again though, to see what happens.",3
B00HVVVMM6,"I like the way they fit for overall length.Being 5'8""  The fit slightly longer then others I have purchased in the Under Arm Area.But overall length I like because they cover my stomach very well. And Tuck into my pants just right. Other then that Just tight.",4
B00HVVVMM6,My husband loves these. They are a perfect length for under shirts. He is 175cm tall and wears a medium.,5
B00HVVVMM6,"These shirts are great for undershirts and catching sweat. I bought these for my husband, and so far there are little to no complaints. The price is also cheaper than purchasing in regular stores. The only problem with these shirts are that they shrink very easily and fade pretty quickly. Other than that it fits true to size and is pretty stretchy.",5
B00HVVVMM6,I ordered a large but they are a little snug. Material and durability is decent for the price. Overall would recommend for a cost efficient tank.,4
B00HVVVMM6,Nice shirts fit well,5
B00HVVVMM6,These are basics and they are good not see through,5
B00HVVVMM6,Buen producto y buena calidad.,5
B00HVVVMM6,"You know what they are. They fit fine, but always err on a smaller side than larger as they're undershirts. I already liked them and just ordered more.",5
B00HVVVMM6,Un poco delgadas para mi gusto. Pero por el precio son buenas.,5
B00HVVVMM6,They fit good and great for the money,5

B00HVVVMM6,"Great material,  I love it",4
B00HVVVMM6,Good quality for a good price,5
B00HVVVMM6,The tops are meant to stretch and are very small when you get them. I would recommend putting your arms in them and stretching them out evenly before wearing,4
B00HVVVMM6,"tank runs very small. my son is a XS or S in all men's clothing and these tanks were tiny. long and narrow, poorly shaped proportionate wise.",3
B00HVVVMM6,Very comfortable.,5
B072L78FT4,"Soft, warm, and comfy.  Check the size chart.  I almost bought one that was too large; glad I followed the size chart guide ... this one is plenty big for an XL person.  The robe I bought was for a L/XL person.",5
B072L78FT4,"This is a very comfortable, warm bathrobe.  Living in a very cold part of the country I found that by wearing this very thick and warm robe I was able to lower my thermostat thereby reducing my electric bill.  The only reason it did not get a five is it had no belt loops for holding the belt in place.",4
B072L78FT4,"I bought this for the hubby for xmas and he LOVES it. He wfh and there are days he stays in this robe. It's so soft and cozy.It's not the greatest quality -- one of the pockets was falling off when I pulled it out of the package. I stitched it back on and you can't tell. Even with that, I'm thinking of buying another one for next xmas so he can rotate his wardrobe. haha. You can't beat the price!In terms of sizing - he's 6' and 250lbs. I bought the 3xl. He's really broad in the shoulders/chest and this fits perfect. The arms are long enough, which is always a problem.",5
B072L78FT4,This is a very good rob and is a lot heavier than I expected,5
B072L78FT4,The weight of this robe is exactly what I was looking for. Something not too heavy and not too thin either. I love the color and the feel of it. After three days the hem started unraveling at the collar. Of course I will return it but I will get a replacement instead of a refund. If it had not been for that I was extremely satisfied with this robe.,4
B072L78FT4,"This was great for the money. It is plush and soft, and the robe runs true to size. The only other thing I could say is it's a little thinner than more expensive robes, but well worth it.",4
B072L78FT4,Husband loves this. He feels like Hugh Hefner walking through the house. Lol Super soft & comfortable.,5
B072L78FT4,"This robe is everything it promised and more, and the price is fantastic for the quality.Also, one reviewer wrote that there were no belt loops on the robe, but there are actuallytwo on each side so a perfect fit could be chosen.",5
B072L78FT4,"Nice color, peels when washed a couple times, heavy, I would buy again.",4
B072L78FT4,Awesome fit and great quality for the money.  Its a heavy robe with no shedding and the size is true. I have purchased three of them as gifts and will be ordering number four.  Love the colorsI,5
B072L78FT4,"Yes.  I ordered it 2 x large. But the point is to swim in a lush robe like this.  So, its perfect.",5
B072L78FT4,I bought this robe for my husband and it is everything they said about it. It is very comfortable and well made.,5
B072L78FT4,I liked the fact that the product consisted of 2 favorite colors of mine - burgundy and black. I'm also very pleased with the material that the bathrobe was made from. Thank you,5

B072L78FT4,Comfortable and good value,5

B072L78FT4,My grandson picked it out. Very soft and comfortable robe.,5
B072L78FT4,"Wanted a loose fitting robe. Ordered a extra large and at 70"" and 190 lbs this swallowed me. My advice order the size for your body type. I love this robe.",5
B072L78FT4,"The price was right for this robe. It is so soft. I purchased a men's size, as I wanted the extra room, length, and comfort. I like the length and it fits me well. I ordered a large and I am 5'7"" and curvy.",5

B072L78FT4,nice,5
B072L78FT4,Very soft and sizes are spot on. Cant beat the red be for the cost.,5
B072L78FT4,"Very nice, hubs loves the softness and feels cozy, length is just right",5
B072L78FT4,"Good, warm robe. One size fits, most. I'm 5'8"", it's a bit big for me, but I rolled up the sleeves and it was fine. The main issue as I see it is the belt won't stay cinched, and I'm not overweight in the least, and when it gets a bit loose it drapes itself under my, glutes. The robe needs a third loop back there, and a way for it to stay tied better.",4
B072L78FT4,"Is just as described, bought for my spouse at Christmas. Love it",5
B072L78FT4,Love my cozy and comfortable bed robe I wear it to bed every night me and my husband have one the same color as well,5

B072L78FT4,Nice for the price.,5
B072L78FT4,He absolutely loves it. The quality is great and keeps you so warm he wore it outside as a jacket lol. The weight of the robe is light for how long it is. 10/10 getting one for myself.,5
B072L78FT4,Warm and stylish,5
B072L78FT4,I washed it before wearing it and it came out perfect. Did i mention how soft and warm it is?,5

B072L78FT4,Great quality!,5
B072L78FT4,"I'm 6ft 230lbs and stocky so I ordered the recommended L/XL. Even though I like the style, and plushness, I'd have to say it fits more like a 2X. I had to double check to make I didn't mis-order. I have to roll the sleeves up one fold and the front panel lays almost to my side hip. Even with these abnormalities I decided to keep it because it is comfortable and warm and since I purchased it on Black Friday, I would have to pay $8 extra for the smaller size and quite frankly I'm a cheap a**.",5
B072L78FT4,High quality.,5
B072L78FT4,This robe is super comfortable and warm. The material is really soft and it's a good winter-weather robe.,5

B072L78FT4,"This is a very soft and comfortable robe.The ties on the side for the belt could be a little bit better, but overall great.",5
B072L78FT4,So soft & good fit. Comfortable but not big or small,5
B072L78FT4,So soft and comfy. Very nice!,5
B088WH5CY4,"Sounds weird to say, but I've had really bad experiences with underwear. Ball-crushing, ride-up, painfully tight, or so baggy there's no support.These are the opposite of that. They are cool when it's hot. They are soft beyond all belief. They hold up in the wash. They don't ride up anywhere near as bad as other underwear. Colors are attractive. Construction is good.They are supportive wear they need to be, snug where they need to be, loose where they need to be.If a perfect pair of underwear exists, this is it. I also highly recommend the perfect black undershirts sold by this company.",5
B088WH5CY4,"In summary, I'm about 5'11"", 180 lbs, 33"" waist. I'm normally a Medium but saw some of the low ratings/reviews so got these in size Small and they fit great! They've worked out excellently since I purchased them here in the fall/winter transition in Oregon.For a longer winded, more thoughtful explanation:I didn't wanna write a review for these til I wore them in as many of my typical life scenarios as possible. And I've continued to alternate between these and my cotton boxer briefs. So now I feel like I can write a fuller review worth reading since I've been wearing these for about a month in various scenarios: formally, casually, during workouts, on fall/winter hikes, in a hot yoga class, during dance events, and around construction jobsites, etc. Here's what I've experienced.I'm really pleased with the way they feel as compared to my normal cotton boxer briefs. They are far cooler, seem to significantly reduce sweatiness, and feel so much lighter. In fact, they don't bunch up and get uncomfortable in the crotch like cotton boxer briefs sometimes do when I'm in higher intensity activities. It often feels like I'm not wearing underwear at all, just airy and light, which is actually more of my preference (others might not like that feeling). Hot yoga with cotton shorts felt really breezy. Casual and formal nights on the town feel super easy and comfortable in any kinda pants I've worn (jeans, dress pants, sweat pants, whatever). Sitting in the office feels better...I didn't even realize how much cotton boxer briefs bunch up in the crotch when I'm slouching in the office chair (of course I need to work on my posture here but I think it's worth noting since most of us don't have the most ergonomic setups at our offices and that might lead to some slouching). Best underwear for slouching!I definitely would recommend getting a size smaller than what you might get in cotton boxer briefs. I usually wear a Medium in cotton boxer briefs so I lucked out by getting these in Small. I'm slim semi-athletic built, so they look really good because they hug low on my thighs without that squeezy feeling that sometimes can cut off circulation. They accentuate my butt. They don't have any wording on the band like many other brands, which is a major win. I do have a little tummy developing that can sometimes feel really annoying on the band, but these are comfy around the waist and don't bunch up under my belly. And it feels like a soft, supportive pouch where the ""junk"" is stored.I wouldn't recommend wearing them on a cold hike or during snowshoeing without other provisions like weather resistant pants or long johns because the cold air goes straight through the boxers. But I did try them with snow pants once and they worked out ""ok"" for a little bit. I still chose to switch into some lycra blend long tights for more warmth though. Maybe different story for more intense winter activities than just hiking and snowshoeing.Overall, I'm really happy with the first pack so I asked my wife to get me more for Christmas. She thinks they look and feel really good on me, which is awesome since I imagine that most boxer briefs are pretty boring to her. I'm looking forward to seeing how they work for me when the summer climates roll back around.",5
B088WH5CY4,"Its been years since I have changed style of underwear but a medical issue that is lingering forced be to both troubleshoot and then search for a new design of underwear.  Without going into much detail. I had two heart procedure the past 2 years and one of them they had to go through both  leg femoral arteries and there was a small issue when they closed one artery. Hence, I have some pain and probable nerve damage/tenderness in that leg/pelvis crease area(groin area). Put slight pressure on it and it really hurts. So with this new less bulky and different underwear design, not having and bulky stitching or heavy seams in that creased area, these underwear are perfect. Alot less pain and I gained a really great soft feeling of this new underwear. Now I don't have to lean on my side to relieve the pain in my upper legs. Amazing what underwear and medical issues link up and make a difference. Wonderful underwear.",5
B000M28FH6,"The socks are very comfortable, right size, good looking , nice fabric, you notice the difference with other brands right away , very nice colors , definitely a good choice",5

Overall, I highly recommend these socks for individuals seeking high-quality athletic socks that can enhance their workout experience.",5
B000M28FH6,My son loves these socks and feels they are both soft and fit comfortably. They wash and wear well and have not been prone to holes in the toes. They have a nice thickness to them and are of good quality. A good value too!,5
B000M28FH6,"There's an odd spot underneath the heel where the stitching that connects the bottom of the sock to the back and top doesn't quite.. connect. The contrast between my black sock and pale skin make this quite a visible defect. After a couple months of use this doesn't seem to harm the integrity of the sock too drastically, though it does bring into question the full lifespan of the sock. It does not appear on each sock but of the twelve pairs I have purchased it does appear on about a third of them.Ultimately, these socks are better than average. They are cheaper than most and better quality than any I have seen at this price point. The material isn't irritable and doesn't fray as quickly nor drastically as the Costco Puma socks.",4
B000M28FH6,"These have been our go-to socks for our teen boys for years now.  The quality truly is top notch.  No shrinkage or pilling, comfortable fit.  Grey is our staple because really it goes with almost everything and doesn't wind up looking dingy like white socks often can.",5
B000M28FH6,"These are a great subscribe and save item for my house as my husband burns through socks on a periodic basis. I've got it down to a tee so that the replacements come in right as he starts to burn holes in the heel.Since I've been buying these and the taller variant for so long, I started to wear them myself and mm, they are comfortable. I sort of turned away from all my other socks for these and they don't leave marks on my legs that make them itch after, so that's a total plus.",5
B000M28FH6,Not hot and they stay soft,5
B000M28FH6,Great socks- very durable and warm. Love the comfort and support,5
B000M28FH6,Exelente,5
B000M28FH6,Very comfortable and durable socks. Very breathable.,5
B000M28FH6,Great value for this product,5
B000M28FH6,Good quality,5
B000M28FH6,Very comfortable and durable. look good too.,5
B000M28FH6,Soft. High ankle coverage. No concerns.,5
B000M28FH6,"These socks are used for long distance running and are very much abused!  They hold up well.  I have a really nice pair of running shoes plus custom insoles but needed a little more cushion so I gave these a try.  I've now purchased 24 pairs!  I'm replacing all of my other running socks with these.  They are cushioned along the entire bottom of the sock, just where I need it and the compression in the arch is just the right amount.  The material helps control moisture which is great..... less sweat = less smell !!!",5
B000M28FH6,Thick and well made.,5
B000M28FH6,Very Satisfied,5
B000M28FH6,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The quality of the socks is great and they are so comfortable like they have some cushion in them. They fit so perfectly to my foot and are so lightweight,4
B000M28FH6,"First, I bought some 'other' brand name socks and I did not like the fit, feel, or sizing.  I was skeptical when I bought these, but I really like them.  They fit right, they feel good, the compression is subtle, the socks seem to breathe well.  All in all a well made athletic sock.  The ONLY thing I would complain about is I thought they were about an inch shorter than I would like for a little better fit above the ankle and for when I am using a walking boot.  Would I order them again?  Absolutely.",4
B000M28FH6,Just as good as all qulity of Adidas. Great sock nothing complain,5
B000M28FH6,"high quality, long lasting and durable. fit true to size.",5
B000M28FH6,Nicelyv,5
B000M28FH6,"The socks are a fit and looks great fit, lightweight, breathable, nice stretchiness, non-shrinkage, and great value.",5
B000M28FH6,"Good Seller, Item came in perfect conditionVery Comfortable.",5
B000M28FH6,"Very nice product, great price.",5
B000M28FH6,Very great socks if you are like them shirt length. they do go above the ankles which is a plus. I would say if you have big feet like I do just slightly stretch out the socks before wearing.,4
B000M28FH6,Not as thick as the previous socks I have ordered from the same brand. They do the job but prefer a thicker fabric.,4
B000M28FH6,These socks are just what i needed for the warmer months of the summer and come with great support for my feet especially working on your toes for most of the day.,5
B000M28FH6,"I used to buy white socks for the summer, dark socks for the winter. I didn't like black socks turning my feet dark in the summer and white socks are only good for about 3 uses until they get too dirty to wear, imo, and too expensive to toss them so often.These, in my mind, are near the perfect sock. So far. I can wear them year-round without worrying about staining my feet for barefoot season, they don't stain that easily, they fit well, are fairly comfortable, decently durable, the elastic at the top stays tight and the colors are pretty steady over time. I have 30 pairs of these now.  I've thrown away all of my other socks and only have these. All of my socks match. Life is better when you don't have to hunt for matching socks.The prices for these seem to fluctuate, but I really only buy them at the lower price point. If the price went up permanently, I might wear these until I found something comparable that was cheaper, then toss these and move to those as my only socks. That may be a hard challenge, though, as these are really quite good overall, especially for the price.Realistically, I think the only thing these socks are ""missing"" is a bit more comfort. A tad thicker or softer. Maybe it's not possible without losing something else that makes these socks great. I have no legitimate complaints and I've been using these over a year now.",5
B000M28FH6,It was soft and worm materialI like it,5
B000M28FH6,I like the socks a lot they seem to be well made. Unfortunately seem to run a little small and fit to tightly around the top.,4
B000M28FH6,great buy better than kohls price!!,5
B000M28FH6,"They are fine in the comfort category but man, they make my feet hot! I feel like the don't breathe at all",4
B000M28FH6,"These are very nice socks. Fit well. However, they are sold as ""cushion"" socks and are too thin to be considered ""cushion."" That's why I rated them as a 4.",4
B000M28FH6,"Interestingly, whereas the ""no show cushioned"" socks were thin, flimsy and the size large was way too small, these are well made, cushioned as advertised and fit my size 9 1/2 foot.  I find this very odd...same company, similar sock [one is ankle length (quarter) one is no-show] , and yet they are completely different in style, material and fit.",5
B000M28FH6,"Just the right fit and cushion, these are the most comfortable socks I own and I have been wearing these over other socks over several years now. I do get the holes in the bottom due to my rough/calloused feet, but I can easily swap them out. great socks!",5
B000M28FH6,I recently ordered these socks. The latest version of these are noticeably thinner than ones in the past. Overall decent socks but much thinner than earlier reducing the cushioning available.,3
B000M28FH6,Love the socks!!,5
B000M28FH6,"Fits well, and after many washings, still looks like new",5
B000M28FH6,Love them very much,5
B000M28FH6,My son only likes this brand so I purchased this for him and he is very happy,5
B000M28FH6,"These are the only socks my son wears these days - he likes the cut as well as the brand name. They do seem to wear out quickly, but he's pretty hard on them. They also tend to pill after a few times through the laundry - he doesn't mind that though. Prefer the grey and darker colors as the white ones seem to discolor pretty quickly through the laundry (even washing with just whites). Will continue to buy as long as he prefers.",4
B000M28FH6,"When you find the perfect sock that fits, buy as many as you can!  I've tried many brands and styles of quarter socks, and these are perfect.  These do not shed any lint like many other brands do (even other styles by Adidas do!).  Other socks will drop loads of lint onto the floor when you take your socks off, but THESE DON'T SHED LINT!  These are great!  Also, since Adidas, like other brands will change the style and look of socks over the years, and I don't like to waste time matching various styles of black quarter socks in my sock drawer, I bought four of these 6-pair packages.  Now when I do laundry, I just dump them all in the drawer together and when I get dressed I'm guaranteed to grab a matching pair.  I might buy even more just to make sure I don't ever run out of matching socks.  Something else important: If you are a size 12 like me, be sure to buy the XL 12-15 and NOT the L 6-12.  6-12 are just too tight and put uncomfortable pressure on your toes.",5
B000M28FH6,Excellent,5
B000M28FH6,Just a great quality product! Very good value value for 6 pairs,5
B000M28FH6,"Nice socks.Fit well.Comfy during exercise (almost the only time I wear them).Free would always be better, of course. But not complaining about price.Do I recommend them ? I just bought more of them.",5
B000M28FH6,"Good sock. Would buy again,",5
B000M28FH6,Quality socks.,5
B000M28FH6,"These socks were a bit small - they did fit me (size 14) but were quite stretched. The fabric is also a bit scratchy on the top and the bottom is not highly cushioned. If you're looking for a thinner sock this might work for you, but I'm returning to get something else.",3
B000M28FH6,comfy socks. i like em.Only real down side is they are thin and don't last too long. usually within a year i am throwing them out. might just be how i walk though. so not sure.,4
B000M28FH6,"Cushioning and quality are nice because of its stretching, no complaint about moisture, my husband likes the colors and it was not too warm for him.",5
B000M28FH6,Bonitos,4
B000M28FH6,"A little tight/snug for my size 10 feet. Also, not nearly as soft as cotton blend socks (these are 97% polyester). Otherwise great socks for walking outside 2-4 miles daily!",4
B000M28FH6,"These socks are great, but I only received five pairs.",4
B000M28FH6,I've been switching brands for more than a year now. I came across this and figured i'd try them. They are my new brand of sock. Im happy with these being the end of my search. They have great arch support and are the perfect quarter length. They are as thick as Hanes but a much snugger fit.,5
B000M28FH6,"Great fit, look good.",5
B000M28FH6,I love adidas quality they put into making a simple sock. They fit like a glove and feel light on my feet. So far no holes or shrinkage have occurred and the elasticity has always made my feet feel secure. Buying more soon.,5
B000M28FH6,I'm writing this review because I stole a pair from my husband and they were super soft. Im now going to buy myself a pack. They keep my toes warm at night and feel so soft.,5
B000M28FH6,"These are the nicest Adidas socks I've ever purchased for my son. They are thick and soft and wash and wear well. Nice, high quality at a fraction of the cost of other brands.",5
B000M28FH6,"Comfortable, easy to wash.",5
B000M28FH6,"I got me my regular size, but the socks are rather snug.  It makes it a wee bit difficult for me to put on.  Maybe it'll get better after several washings?",4
B000M28FH6,"Not wanting to look like every teenager in the world with Nike labeled socks, I chose the Adida brand instead.  These are great socks and will be purchasing more so I never run out.",5
B000M28FH6,Very comfortable,5
B000M28FH6,"These socks are about the only ones I wear anymore. They are NOT paper thin so in the heat of summer your feet may sweat so keep that in mind and they are not really water/sweat wicking but they still work good for me. They have good support, good cushion, and they don't wear out in a month. For the price I have bought these before and will continue.",4
B000M28FH6,"I bought several pairs of these comfy socks for home and workout. They fit well. Unfortunately, after washing them the first time, I found much of the socks' fluff wound up in the dryer's lint catcher. A gentle washing and moderate drying revealed socks that appeared to be mesh tucked with fuzzy, loose fluff. I wish they were more sturdily constructed, especially seeing that they carry the trusted brand name of Adidas.",4
B000M28FH6,Size 12 feet and they fit amazing!  Super soft and shows just over my hightops.,5
B000M28FH6,"I have been buying this exact model of sock for years now, to the point were outside of dress socks they are the only type I own. Excellent product that I wear everyday.",5
B000M28FH6,"These breathe well, even on my feet",3
B000M28FH6,"These socks are a little thin and not sure how many uses they will have after a few washes. But they fit well, look good, rise to just above the ankle, and are comfortable.",5
B000M28FH6,faster than im used to at least,4
B000M28FH6,Excelente,5
B000M28FH6,"Your search for the perfect socks are over!At least it was over for me.  I spent a good hour looking for the perfect pair of quarter socks on Amazon.  I looked at well over a dozen different brands, poured through hundreds of reviews and debated one product against another.I finally settled on these Adidas socks for two reasons:  First, I have faith in the Adidas brand.  Secondly, these are actually one of the best rated quarter socks on Amazon.  I can save you the trouble of going through all the research i did by telling you that up front.You get six pairs of socks in the package.When you slip these socks on, you immediately notice how soft they feel on your feet.  The socks look durable, and there is enough elastic hold that they stay wrapped around the base of your leg instead of sliding into the footwear.At first, I thought I would be turned off by the logo on the side.  Really, they don't appear to be a huge deterrent.  These socks don't just feel good, but look good as well.There is another factor about these socks that attracted me to them:  price.  I wear a 9.5-10"" shoe.  A six pack of these socks cost me under $15 (at the time of this review).  That's not a bad price.  In fact, I would call it a great bang for the buck.So far, the socks have held up well after washing.  Still nice and soft.  My feet feel more comfortable when walking in them.",5
B000M28FH6,"My son will only wear these socks. I have tried others that are cheaper and ,to me, seem like the same thing. Nope. Adidas might be more expensive but they hold up well and they are comfy. They stay that way after many washes.",5
B000M28FH6,"I like these socks.  I was hoping for something as high as the ankle, but just not positive that would be what I would get.  Well, that's exactly what I got, and I like them very much.  They appear to be a good sock, but I think I'll know more after I wash them for the first time.",5
B000M28FH6,"From ages 10 to 17, I wore only white ankle socks. They served their purpose well, but naturally became dirty over time. At 18, it was time to become an adult.So I switched to black ankle socks - a logical move. Like the white socks, they served their purpose well, and they no longer (visibly) dirtied over time. But the black sock presented a new beast. Paired with the mediocre clothes-washing skills of a young adult, they had their fate sealed from the moment they were purchased. All of my beloved black socks noticeably faded over time, some succumbed to the cruel mistress that is chlorine bleach, and a few vanished entirely. Whatever their fate, it was time for another change.With crew socks making a strong comeback, I had my next move. But I hadn't taken the time to reflect on my past forays into the sock market. First it was white and  then it was black...but the same faults that plagued their low-riding counterparts also plagued these formidable crew socks. I was lost. Now what?On the eve of October 29th, 2016, the straw broke the camel's back. The sock market had crashed, and my stock of crew socks had diminished in value by 50%. It was now a buyer's market, so I got to thinking: White ankle socks. Black ankle socks. White crew socks. Black crew socks. What was I missing...? It hit me. Gray. Gray socks! They wouldn't get dirty, and they wouldn't noticeably fade - they're gray! But wait. Ankle? Crew? It hit me again, the second wind! Quarter socks! The best of both worlds! I can wear long pants and people can't see my ankles when I sit down!It was a pivotal day in my life. I reflect some two and a half months later, with my sock supply going strong at 100%, and I feel content yet...compelled. Pulled by the gravitational force of the gray sock, I double down. I'm in it for the long haul, now. My IRA is 50% S&P index funds and 50% quarter-length gray socks, and I've never been happier.",5
B000M28FH6,Adidas black ankle socks fit perfectly; excellent value for the quantity provided. My feet are immensely happy!,5
B000M28FH6,"Love these socks. Go good with my crocs. I get compliments all the time. Soft, thick bottom. 10/10",5
B000M28FH6,"These were good quality socks, good color and support.",5
B000M28FH6,Great quality socks,5
B000M28FH6,My feet tend to get hot and sweat a lot and these socks keep them cool while being comfortable to wear,5
B000M28FH6,I love hpw soft these socks are. They fit snug on my feet and given that it's snug I feel like I have a better performance when exercising. I love that the are very durable as no holes have been made yet. Overall all ot provides me with stability and increase my performance compare to other socks that I have used in the past. I would really recommend.,5
B09P8DM9RH,These sock are really thin but they hold up well and are comfortable,5
B09P8DM9RH,"I don't really like thick socks and these are pretty thin so if you don't like thin don't get them but you get so many for the price and I love them, I feel like they are the right size also.",5
B09P8DM9RH,I really like that you get so many for such a little price. I think they could be a little thicker.,4
B09P8DM9RH,Good product.,5
B09P8DM9RH,These socks were so soft and comfortable but they ripped so easily. I wore them one day and got home and there was a hole and they felt super thin.,2
B09P8DM9RH,A little thin. Not the quality I was expecting.,4
B09P8DM9RH,I purchased these socks because they are thin. I run 5 miles a day and needed to keep y feet dry and cool. these socks do just that. I very happy with this purchase.,5
B09P8DM9RH,Great socks for a great price! I have ordered numerous times!,5
B09P8DM9RH,Great basic socks. Soft and comfortable. Recommend,5
B09P8DM9RH,These are extremely thin and get dirty so very fast. I slid so easy with these. I wear them on emergency situations but I bought others.,4
B09P8DM9RH,Too thin but overall I'd buy them again very good price,4
B09P8DM9RH,These socks are so short they barely stretch enough to cover my heel. They smash my toes back and I had to stop wearing them.,3
B09P8DM9RH,"I like these socks, thanks",5
B09P8DM9RH,Light weight and confortable,4
B09P8DM9RH,"I was hoping for something a little thicker in fabric. They aren't slip resistant, the quality is amazing little thin. They did fit perfect. They did not shrink when washed. They could be a little more comfortable. Overall they do the job in being a socks.",3
B09P8DM9RH,They are thin but it's ok I will double them,5
B09P8DM9RH,"No complaints. Great, thin socks for a good price.",5
B09P8DM9RH,I like these thin low cut socks.  They are not ankle socks.  I wear womens size 8 shoe and they are perfect.  They'd be too small for a large foot.  I don't like thick socks so these are good for me.  I like having so many as they all match if some get holes or disappear in the wash.,5
B09P8DM9RH,SUPER THIN,4
B09P8DM9RH,Lightweight and comfortable.,5
B09P8DM9RH,"They are too big for the size they list them as, other than that, they are fine.",3
B09P8DM9RH,"These are very soft and lightweight. Also, you get a 15 pairs so I would definitely recommend.",5
B09P8DM9RH,Love the upgraded packaging!,5
B09P8DM9RH,Size is smaller than you think,3
B09P8DM9RH,Great price and good fit,4
B09P8DM9RH,"These socks are extremely thin, you can see your skin through them.",3
B09P8DM9RH,"nice thin foot hugging ankle hugging socks. they dont fall down. decent cheap ankle socks not much to say .... came in a nice package bag thing to keep them in til u use them. i love a fresh pair of socks but who doesn't, right? . they are on the thin side like i said, i like that. personal preference but yeah these are fine thin enough to fit into any shoe but also not too thin either.",5
B09P8DM9RH,Okay,5
B09P8DM9RH,They feel and look like sheer.  They r too thin.,4
B09P8DM9RH,I was already aware of how thin they were. So I layer two socks together and for the price these are amazing,4
B09P8DM9RH,These socks are like you thought about wearing socks for the day but never really put them on haha will I return them? No. But I will definitely never buy these again. One slightly strong flashlight would make these socks disappear on my feet.,3
B09P8DM9RH,They r really thin I thought in the picture they would be thick but no they r thin. But they ok.,3
B09P8DM9RH,very thin but okay for the price i guess,3
B09P8DM9RH,Super thin,3
B09P8DM9RH,"If you hate thick socks, get these!  They are thin stretchy and comfy.  I have a more wide foot and they fit great!  Would definitely get again.",5
B09P8DM9RH,I like them for my children but they are thin. But that's cool and they wasn't that expensive.,4
B09P8DM9RH,I had to triple up on the number of socks per foot to put on in order for comfort. These socks remind me of socks for church as a child.,3
B09P8DM9RH,Very thin material. Slips off of my feet while wearing,3
B09P8DM9RH,Kinda thin,3
B09P8DM9RH,Good socks. They have not gotten holes or shrunk yet and they fit to the length they should.,5
B09P8DM9RH,"very soft and comfortable for everyday leisure wear.  wouldn't recommend if you're going to do a marathon but around the house lounging and everyday easy wear, they're just right.i got these because i'm a diabetic patient and wearing socks that are size 9 to 12 fits most tend to give me blisters due to the excess material bunching up and moving around, so finding these in the right size was a real treasure.",5
B09P8DM9RH,"Exactly as I searched for:- Thin- Breathable- Black ankle socksSo thin I can pretty much see my skin through them. Perfect. Just what I wanted.If you ordered these and complain about them being too THIN because you can SEE YOUR FEET, well maybe you should have ordered some THICK(er) socks, dude. Just sayin'...",5
B09P8DM9RH,"These are pretty scratchy, thin, and have a huge uncomfortable seam across the toe. Not a fan.",2
B09P8DM9RH,"These are thin, think thick nylons, but that is exactly what I was looking for. They are comfortable and perfect for days you need shoes, but want a thin sock.",5
B09P8DM9RH,Honestly 14 pairs of socks for 2.99 this is a steal pack in a very light and thin packaging the socks are great quality very soft fabric fits just right. They are not slip resistant but the comfortability and durability of these socks are very great.,5
B09P8DM9RH,"These socks are great for what you pay for. I love how they give u 14 pairs. They are very thin. Almost feels like panty hoes for your feet. Great for form fitting, tight shoes. Great for the summer time.",4
B09P8DM9RH,"This is a good price for the amount of socks you get, however, they are extremely thin. If I snag them on anything, they typically rip and need thrown away. If you are looking for quantity over quality, these would do the trick!",3
B09P8DM9RH,Don't expect them to stand up to heavy duty wear.,3
B09P8DM9RH,"My teen has been happy with these socks. They fit fine, are comfortable, and there are lots of them. They are a little on the thin side, but we live in a warm climate, so that's not a big problem. Can't beat  14 pairs of socks at this price point.",5
B09P8DM9RH,"When I first opened the socks, I thought they were cheap and not going to be comfortable.I was wrong! If you are looking for thin athletic socks that stay on, these are for you! When you put them on, you will be able to see your toes (thin). Once you get used to that, you will love them. Will not provide any warmth!",5
B09P8DM9RH,The material is thin (basically see through) but are very comfy. No issues yet but can tell they rip easily and wear down fast,3
B09P8DM9RH,"I should have read the reviews first, I just saw 4.2 stars and over 1k reviews and purchased them. The socks are extremely thin. Kind of remind me of the free stockings they have at the department stores for when you try shoes on.",3
B09P8DM9RH,They are very see through. I do not like that at all!,3
B09P8DM9RH,They are really thin and cooling good for the price,4
B09P8DM9RH,"They have holes after one wear.  They stain my feet black. Thin, cheap.  I will never buy them again.",2
B09P8DM9RH,Love these socks,5
B09P8DM9RH,"These sox are so thin and cheap they're like nylon tights. But the worst part is the bully seam that goes across my toes and makes them uncomfortable. I wish I hadn't ordered them, and I wish I had returned them but I forgot and now the time is up.",2
B09P8DM9RH,I love them but they are so thin.  If you catch it on anything they rip,4
B09P8DM9RH,I can feel the bulb or lump of stitching on my feet. Not a great feeling. The length and thickness is good though. I still wear them.,3
B09P8DM9RH,Very thin. Great for summer  but not with snaekers or running. Lost shape after first was,3
B09P8DM9RH,"They're thin, but they are so comfy, and the price is great for the number of socks you get. I use them for around the house and sleeping and they're perfect. I'm a women's size 7 and they fit just right.",5
B09P8DM9RH,Great for someone who likes super thin socks! My daughter loves them!,5
B09P8DM9RH,"Socks were so thin.  I may actually have to send them back, they are paper thin.",2
B09P8DM9RH,I was looking for thin socks and found the perfect ones. They fit great and are super comfy.,5
B09P8DM9RH,"They are ok, just very thin, and I mean very thin",3
B09P8DM9RH,Fit,5
B09P8DM9RH,Do they cover your feet? Yes.Are they thick socks? Not at all. Rather sheer and don't seem like they will last all that long. Good enough for now and for the price,4
B09P8DM9RH,I would not buy these again. Shockingly thin. Like a thin tight,2
B09P8DM9RH,"I bought this product and is highly satisfied. It helps for sports, comfort, and hiking. It also handles well with moisture. Most socks don't handle well with moisture, meanwhile these socks handle well with moisture. It also fits most shoe brands.",5
B09P8DM9RH,"They are very lightweight and comfortable. I am a size 10, I don't think they would fit a larger size. I live in a very hot climate, so I appreciate the thinness. Unfair to rank them higher at this point because I do not know the durability.",4
B09P8DM9RH,The socks were to thin of fabric,4
B09P8DM9RH,"Very light weight really great quality, purchased several times they are absolutely my favorite",5
B09P8DM9RH,These socks are super thin. Other than that they are fine.,2
B09P8DM9RH,"These are incredibly thin, to the point where I had to double them up for them to be of any use.",3
B09P8DM9RH,They slip off the ankle all day but are very thin for hot weather,3
B09P8DM9RH,"When it says ""thin"" in the description, it is very true.  The socks feel like nylons.",3
B09P8DM9RH,These are great lightweight socks perfect for summer!!,5
B09P8DM9RH,You get what you pay for!,3
B0CRHF41F7,My son needed black shorts to wear to his daily football workouts during the school year. These have worked wonderfully for him. They get washed OFTEN and are holding up well.  He is 5'10 and weighs about 150 and they fit him well.,5

B0CRHF41F7,Good value for price.,4
B0CRHF41F7,"Great buy. I love the fit, softness, and the deep pockets. A few months ago I lost my wallet in a supermarket. Fortunately, the guy who found it went through the store to find me and refused a reward, which I tried and would have been happy to reward him. Those were nice shorts but I realized the pockets were not deep. I checked all my short's pockets after that. Some were deep but only the heavy material shorts. These are the type of shorts I need for Florida summers. Now I can go shopping without worrying about losing my wallet.",5
B0CRHF41F7,"They were just what I expected, decent shorts and decent value",5
B0CRHF41F7,This are a perfect for what I wanted.,5
B0CRHF41F7,"Excelentes para hacer ejercicio, material resistente.",5

B0CRHF41F7,Cooler to wear,5
B0CRHF41F7,My husband loved them,5
B0CRHF41F7,Nice fabric,4
B0CRHF41F7,"Had these now for a couple of weeks and they are holding up well so far, nice and thick material so they aren't see through, the fit is good, would say it's slightly bigger than the size stated but they have plenty of stretch which is great",4
B0CRHF41F7,Not a fan of the shiny material but that is just personal preferancee.  Fit well and light weight,4
B0CRHF41F7,They are very well made,5
B0CRHF41F7,Light weight  good sizing,5
B0CRHF41F7,Se ven bien y son de buena calidad,4
B0CRHF41F7,These are little small,4
B0CRHF41F7,"These are actually some fairly good pants. Yes they are lightweight and seem easy to get dirty, but construction quality is decent and very much worth the price paid for them! The ones I received ran true to size,",4
B0CRHF41F7,Good for the price,4
B0CRHF41F7,Bought for my husband has good length down to his knees he says he really likes them and that they are comfortable,5
B0CRHF41F7,Wish they had a pocket in the back,4
B010RWD4GM,They fit perfectly! Love the material. Price is just right. Highly recommend.,5
B010RWD4GM,This was a re-buy for the 2nd time...good quality and price,5
B010RWD4GM,"I hate thin socks, so I got these. And they're perfectly cushy...",5
B010RWD4GM,As described,5
B010RWD4GM,These socks feel great and after a couple months of having them they are still in good condition. Can tell these are not the real nike socks though.,4
B010RWD4GM,"Socks were gifts, they were liked a lot.",5
B010RWD4GM,They fit,4
B010RWD4GM,"Very comfortable and look good but rip easily, 8/10.",4
B010RWD4GM,good fit,5
B010RWD4GM,"Bought these for my son, loves them and only wears nike. Great pair can't go wrong, delivered quick.",5
B010RWD4GM,"Great for price, comfort, and any activities where you might sweat.",5
B010RWD4GM,"These socks are being worn by my son and it was wonderful that they fit so well!-He has an extra-wide foot and they fit with comfort and was not difficult to get on.- After many washes, they have stayed solid black as well the white Nike symbol didn't have any greying.-They are soft and thick to soak up that sweat if your feet sweat a lot this is great so it stops the shoes from smelling and feet dry.-The band was thin for thinner calves but modeled to my son's calves so he wasn't losing them in his workboots- with the last bullet, they keep there shape very well and when the washed stay in the nice form to be put away.My son and I as a mother would highly recommend these socks to an Amazon buyer.  Mom's stay safe and buy these they will stop and argument in the house the price is the best part!!",5
B010RWD4GM,These were my gym socks I'd use daily. I run and lift in them. Developed holes around the 7 month marker. Personally I think that's a decent amount of time with all the stress I put on them. But would like to see better quality from a name brand.,4
B010RWD4GM,These are perfect,5
B010RWD4GM,I bought some of the same years ago and these are very close to those. They seem thinner and a bit shorter than the previous ones. Nike socks are still the best overall.,4
B010RWD4GM,Shorter but still good quality,4
B010RWD4GM,The socks fit well. They don't slip down.  Very good,5
B010RWD4GM,This sucks are extremely poor in quality after one use they get hole on the hill area and I m only 110lbs it has nothing to do w your weight just extremely poor quality not recommending this at all,1
B010RWD4GM,Love Nike socks. They are so comfortable and good material.,5
B010RWD4GM,they are nice,5
B010RWD4GM,"I teach cycling about 4 days a week and as a result, go through a lot of socks. I turned to Amazon to find some Nike mid-calf socks. For starters, the price point is competitive - 6 pairs of socks for $16 is great. Quality is pretty good but I think my Adidas socks feel a bit more tight and higher quality. I still think these do well for working out, but one thing I will note is that you can sometimes see the sweat soak through on the foot. Pretty common though. All in all, I'm satisfied with the sock and think they're great for working out or just day to day wear.",4
B010RWD4GM,"These socks are great. I walk a lot either at work, or on the golf course. These socks are terrific. The only reason for 4 stars on durability is because they don't last as long as some nikes I have had in the past, but they have still done very well.",5
B010RWD4GM,Bought for my son for the second time.,4
B010RWD4GM,"These socks are great.  Not long before I bought these, I bought 12 pairs of another brand.  they sucked.  i hated them so much I went ahead and ordered six of these NIKEs in white and six in black.  Good move on my part.  These are great, well put together.  They've got that section in the middle of the foot that hugs a little tighter that keeps em in place.  Very comfortable.  There is a bit of cushion I can actually feel to them so they are fun to wear.  These are just right with sneaks.  I've had them a while and they seem to wash just fine.",5
B010RWD4GM,I run with this everyday. Does the work. Comfortable. Stretchy. Nothing to complain.,5
B010RWD4GM,Good product,4
B010RWD4GM,"These socks are amazing. The sizing chart is spot on. I wear a mens size 9 and the large pair fits me perfectly. I am really into working out and anything that keeps me up and moving so I like socks that can keep my feet dry. These do just that! The only thing that I do not like about this particular products is that they only come in two colors. I would like more color options. I would definitely recommend these socks to anyone who is active or just trying to keep up with todays ""styles.""",4
B010RWD4GM,"I've had these for a few months and they are terrible quality. Several have ripped and torn. I have some Nike socks I bought from the outlet that have held up for years, these socks are not the same.",1
B010RWD4GM,They loved their Christmas gift.,5
B010RWD4GM,"I love these socks, but you definitely need to have thinner feet/ankles. I bought a size up in mens just in case. They're definitely comfortable, they're just a little tight with very little give around the top band. Otherwise, they came as described, very nice. I guess we'll see what happens after I was and dry them.",4
B010RWD4GM,"I loved how fast the shipping was, and I just love the way these feel on my feet.",5
B010RWD4GM,Good price good product,5
B010RWD4GM,The socks do not come up on calves as high as they appear in the pictures. We needed to return them,3
B010RWD4GM,They are just as described,5
B010RWD4GM,great product. great price.,5
B010RWD4GM,"Good, sturdy, well made socks with a name brand. I needed something plain black and with minimal logos. These do the job. As for the proclaimed arch support(which is why I paid extra for these) and performance cushioning, I notice no real difference between these and any other pair of socks that I own. If the price ever comes down, I'd buy them again but $20 was a bit too much since I noticed no discernible difference with the arch support.",4
B010RWD4GM,"Nike socks that hold up well. True to size - my teen son wears size 11 gym shoes, got these in size L and the fit is perfect. No shrinking in the washer/dryer.",5
B010RWD4GM,"Excellent quality and quantity for the price! I've bought several packages over the last year for husband, son, and son-in-law. They do fade pretty quickly so I recommend washing in cold water only with darks. I will mention that They are not as tall/high as my son(s) prefer to wear with their basketball shorts but that's the only negative.",5
B010RWD4GM,"ALOT thinner than before, and alot shorter, these are not as good as nike socks used to be.not so bad id return them but i wont buy them again",3
B010RWD4GM,Nice,5
B010RWD4GM,Bought 2  and both sets for sin and husband are all getting holes after 1 or 2x use. Very bad quality.,1
B010RWD4GM,I will purchase it again,5
B010RWD4GM,"Had originally written a one star review as I felt the product did not live up to its status as a ""running"" sock.  In subsequent months (a couple of years) it's occurred to me that the socks have worn well, and, although not without the ""thickness and support"" of what you'd expect from a running sock, they've served their purpose quite nicely.  Especially for the price.",4
B010RWD4GM,Good quality as expected.,4
B010RWD4GM,"These should have been advertised as Dry Fit; unlike years past, that is usually written above toes; had we seen we would not have ordered. We wanted 100% cotton. Makes one wonder, really Nike???",3
B010RWD4GM,"I bought these to replace similar ones I bought about 2 years ago. Love them just the same. I had the same issue of the last socks, the fabric on the bottom starts to peel off of them leaving many transparent grid areas. All of them. Additionally, one of the socks, just one individual sock, had 2 holes on it.These issues are very annoying as these socks aren't cheat whatsoever.I made sure not to pull them off the plastic tab to not cause holes and used scissors to cut the tag off, but one still had 2 holes and they all start to peel off within a few weeks :/Very dissatisfied.",2
B010RWD4GM,I needed a pair for volleyball and the socks are nice not the best... but the one thing that bugs me is that if you put them on properly the logos aren't exactly on the right and left sides of your legs.  I would say a few of my pairs are 15-35 degrees off.not a problem just a little annoyance.,4
B010RWD4GM,"I've only used these for casual wear so far and they've been holding up fine. Not sure how they do for athletic wear, I would assume well. At first though, I did get a lot of fuzz stuck to my feet, which is why there are only 4 stars. But these are extremely comfy to wear.",4
B010RWD4GM,"These are very comfortable, stretchy, breathable and overall good.",5
B010RWD4GM,"I got this sock a few years ago, and I think there used to be more cotton in it, than the current version.  There is a distinct comfort issue on the newer version, and I don't think there's very much cotton if any in this version.  Too bad.",3
B010RWD4GM,"I thought these would stand up to the challenge of the workouts or even just plain running/hiking throughout the day. This product did not last very long until holes started showing up. So I went to the the Nike store and bought the real Dri-Fit socks and they are way better than these ""performance"" socks. Way to thin to be even called performance socks. I got Hanes performance socks from Walmart that lasted longer than these. I don't recommend for running or hiking. Look elsewhere.",2
B010RWD4GM,"I have own many pairs of these sock and each one usually last around 3-5months before it starts to lose it shape and have holes on them. It should last longer but since I use them for running 5+ miles and walking to work 2-4 miles everyday, 3-5 months isn't too bad.Considering how much i'm actually using them.",4
B010RWD4GM,Great price for product,5
B010RWD4GM,Great quality and comfy,5
B010RWD4GM,My boyfriend is a welder and goes through socks like water. These are the only socks that last him,5
B010RWD4GM,Good socks,5
B010RWD4GM,"I needed some casual socks.  Reviews were OK on Nike so I thought I'd give them a try.  They fit fine and are comfortable but they have one annoying feature.  Even after repeated washings, they continue to leave black lint between and under my toes.  I never had this problem before with any other brand of socks.  It's annoying as every time I take a pair of socks off, there's black lint on the bathroom floor.  These socks have been washed at least a dozen times.  Next time I'll try another brand.",3
B010RWD4GM,I bought these for my boyfriend and he prefers his older socks to these. Says these fit really tight compared to other ones by them.,3
B010RWD4GM,My son always wears these socks and they're good for him. They last a long time and he says they're comfortable.,5
B010RWD4GM,"Classic Nike tube socks, I wear these at the gym and they're perfect. These are a little thicker than some of their older socks, so it seems like Nike has made some updates and upgrades. These also seem to ride up a little higher on the calf than older Nike socks that I've purchased at their Retail or Outlet stores, but I don't mind too much. All in all, some of the simplest and best athletic socks out there, you can't go wrong.",5
B010RWD4GM,The only socks my bf will wear.,5
B010RWD4GM,Great,5
B010RWD4GM,I have three boys and we are always losing socks. It seems like I buy a pack every month!  These are their favorites so far so maybe they will keep up with them. They always prefer black socks and they are happy they have the Nike logo on them.  I bought a pack of the crew socks and a pack of the ankle socks.  Both are great!,5
B010RWD4GM,"Only socks my hubby will wear. Color stays dark, comfortable and absorbent.",5
B010RWD4GM,"These socks are my teenage sons go to socks.  He wears them daily.  Great fit, comfort and wear.",5
B010RWD4GM,These are extremely comfortable socks.,5
B010RWD4GM,So comfortable always buy,5
B010RWD4GM,"So disappointing!  I bought these socks a couple of years ago, and they are awesome, so I went back to my old orders on amazon and reordered them.  But they must be made with different materials now because after one wash, they are garbage.  Falling apart, covered in lint... ugh!  I wish they had just kept them how they used to be.  And I wish I had read all the comments before buying them!  I feel like they shouldn't be able to sell these under the same 'name and style' as the ones that have a different material make-up, because they are completely different than the quality ones that I bought a couple of years ago.  Nike, a company obviously doing just fine with profits, decides to cut corners and save a buck or two at the expense of the quality of their product.  Okay, I'm done ranting... if you buy these, you WILL be disappointed!",1
B010RWD4GM,These are a little tight on my feet and calves but are okay otherwise,4
B010RWD4GM,I think they are a bit overpriced to be honest. But they do what they need to do. The only thing that I didn't like is that it seems that the socks tend to release a lot of lint when wearing/ washing.,4
B010RWD4GM,I bought these socks for my grandson to wear to school. I am glad I did. He wears them everyday and the socks have held up very well. The color has remained through all the washings and have not lost its shape. I will definitely be buying these again. Well worth it. Great socks!,5
B010RWD4GM,"I use these socks almost everyday for work, gym, and running. I have used them for over a year and have had nothing but fantastic results with them. They have not faded in color over the years and continue to be a great and comfortable product! :)",5
B010RWD4GM,"These socks last a while. If you're athletic and wear them running you may get a couple of months out of them. I've had similar pairs that did not last anywhere near as long as these ones, and I'm hoping the quality keeps up. As far as looks go; they're a typical black matte sock, and they feature the Nike logo on side.",5
B010RWD4GM,Unisex means small.  If you are a man these might not be for you.,2
B010RWD4GM,Christmas gift for my Hocky playing Grandson!,5
B010RWD4GM,A little big but nice fit.,5
B010RWD4GM,Great quality & accurate sizing,5
B010RWD4GM,Good quality,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Moisture-wicking Cotton, knit, soft, comfy boxers. Well made, thick, 5 pack was a great price for the money. Durable, and fits great.",5
B00CAXS3LS,My husband had me buying this again for the elasticity and the fabric is so Soft and comfortable. He says it keeps him dry. Good Sellers,5
B00CAXS3LS,Comfy and fits perfect,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Nice cotton boxers withe the button closure,  good value for money, fit well and are soft, material is as expected not thin a more cozy feel. Do not wear these to the gym in shorts you will expose yourself.",4
B00CAXS3LS,Love the integrity of the material! Holds up well with washing and drying. Size fits perfect!!,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Frankly these are the best boxer briefs I have ever owned.  I wear between a M and a L and I ordered the large solid all cotton because I wash underwear on hot with the double rinse setting and dry on medium.  These do not shrink much (if at all), and even though I don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets they come out soft and smooth.  The price is great.I read a bad review with a photo of wrinkled underwear in which the writer was displeased, but I have had the opposite experience.",5
B00CAXS3LS,My son likes a loose legged cotton boxer. These are great. The material is soft and comfortable. They fit him perfectly. I recommend these.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Really good quality underwear , they are really comfortable,and do not really ride up.",5
B00CAXS3LS,I bought 2 packs of Fruit Underware!! and sent them BACK!  Thankyou Amazon!! I dont know if they are made in ASIA!! But All my clothes are large!! Was A xl 5!! But I would of had to buy A xl 2 for them to be comftorable NOT TIGHT<TIGHT<TIGHT!! like they were made for A preteen boy  THESE are Great!!! fit GREAT and are cotton so they breathe!.  Buy the Fruit ones only if you are A fruitie lover and want to wear something uncomfratable!!,5
B00CAXS3LS,No real complaints,4
B00CAXS3LS,"Amazon suggested ""Large"".  Gave them to friend that is 5'10"" at 244 lbs. Fit him great. Should have ordered ""Medium"".",4
B00CAXS3LS,"Good fit, good quality",5
B00CAXS3LS,Excellent product,5
B00CAXS3LS,Happy camper,5
B00CAXS3LS,Comfy,5
B00CAXS3LS,That's really all I needed,5
B00CAXS3LS,Good,4
B00CAXS3LS,The 5 pack was the way to go. They fit and look great. Very happy with purchase.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Comfortable fit and good elastic. After many washings the elastic is still stretchy.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Great fit.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Great fit and quality,5
B00CAXS3LS,Great quality and fast delivery,5
B00CAXS3LS,yes very sexy,5
B00CAXS3LS,I have bought these before. Great fit great Price.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Wearable,5
B00CAXS3LS,But can you believe i have to order more due to weight loss???? Love the price,4
B00CAXS3LS,"True to size , comfortable hubby and sons loved them",4
B00CAXS3LS,They're nice.What I expected?They fit right and what else can I say,5
B00CAXS3LS,Great Price and Quality,5
B00CAXS3LS,"I used them for undies of course - but being cotton they might work well for wiping windows too. Buying undies for a variety of men sizes and shapes is tough. I first got some but didn't know how they were formed - crotch size- gut size - those 5 were pretty bad. there was no crotch - it was seemed to a tiny crotch point and wide open inside down the legs. Nothing to minimize any accidental leakage) down the leg and into the socks.  Got this Hanes pair and they were perfect - good secure upper leg seal and very comfy - wider sewn crotch fits better and no Hammock which most don't need anyway (maybe a status symbol??  Very comfy elastic and it doesn't roll up all the tie like many similar ones - esp. those real-narrow elastics.  I am 266 and 6+ft and almost 80 yrs. - so I want to spend my last days in comfy undies and will put that I want these when I'm dead and buried - stone will say ""Died with his Hanes on!""",4
B00CAXS3LS,"This is my 2nd time ordering these and they are great, my favorite to wear. Only off thing was the 2nd time around they came in a clear bag rather than the original packaging like the first time, they seem fine but just seemed a little weird.",4
B00CAXS3LS,We wear these to sleep in.  As women we like the softness and coverage.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Quality boxers,5
B00CAXS3LS,highly recommended.,5
B00CAXS3LS,These are very good undergarments for anyone who likes soft loose material. They are not tight fitting like some briefs they're loose on the leg and the material feels very soft would highly recommend for anyone who likes loose fitting undergarment,5
B00CAXS3LS,"These are good, Hanes quality. However, they run very large. I received the first-order and had to send it back because it was too large. After after returning the product and receiving the same product but a smaller size everything was perfect.",5
B00CAXS3LS,"I like the fit, colors and price.",5
B00CAXS3LS,Thin material. A little bit of a weird fit,3
B00CAXS3LS,"I bought them for my boyfriend,  he loved them, very soft and comfy, breathable material.",5
B00CAXS3LS,Husband sleeps in them.,4
B00CAXS3LS,These were exactly what I was hoping for they're roomy but not too long. Fabric is more stiff than soft. Colors look good and fit looks good too,5
B00CAXS3LS,"I have made three purchases of these shorts. I use them for sleep and for wearing around the house. My original purchase was the best. The others are passable, but the fabric is noticeably thinner. I can always tell which order the shorts I'm wearing came from.  I have no interest in shopping around for something better, but I wanted to mention my disappointment with what has become of them.",3
B00CAXS3LS,"Not crazy about the waste band, but fit was good.",4
B00CAXS3LS,These were true to size. Fit well. Got exactly what I expected. No complaints.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Comfortable, but one pair came with a 1 inch seam defect that wasn't sewn properly so had a pre-existing hole.",4
B00CAXS3LS,"I like these boxers.  I already have been wearing these but they are aging.  Some colors have a poly blend, some don't but hard to notice.  Hanes has a cool tech type of fabric that is impossible to find anymore, and I ""prefer"" those but can't find, or if I do they are hella expensive.  For now, these fit the bill.  I'd like that ""iQ"" or whatever it's called for the fabric though.  Can't go wrong with these.  Comfy, not  binding like the linen types or whatever.  Similar to t shirt material so it will give as you move.",5
B00CAXS3LS,I like! Roomy. Nice material!,5
B00CAXS3LS,They very comfortable and there is no label or tag to scratch.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Good every day boxers...aren't made of material that'll blow your socks off, but great everyday. Boxers... Replacing my aging collection with these and I'm happy with them so far.",5
B00CAXS3LS,Under ware,5
B00CAXS3LS,Fast deliveryLittle bit oversize,5
B00CAXS3LS,there nice way better then walmart options,5
B00CAXS3LS,Just as expected,4
B00CAXS3LS,Good quality happy with purchase.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"very soft, and just tight enough to stay on, but baggy enough to be very comfortable.",5
B00CAXS3LS,Good product just as described still in use,4
B00CAXS3LS,"When I was buying this I went through the reviews to see if any woman have used it, and whether they liked it. I found exactly one (she said it's great). Based on that one review I took the plunge.I am 145lb, 5'4, muscular build, medium fits me well. It's baggy, soft, super-comfy, not tight at the waist at all, but isn't in any danger to fall either, doesn't roll up or down. Solves its purpose extremely well.",5
B00CAXS3LS,"Got them a few days back, satisfied with the quality. They r very comfortable and all the right colors.",4
B00CAXS3LS,"I have worn Hanes boxer shorts for 30 years and was disappointed to find that these are not the typical loose-fitting shorts I am used to purchasing. These are tight-fitting, more similar to boxer briefs than boxer shorts. That being said, they are soft and true to size.",3
B00CAXS3LS,"I was skeptical buying boxers online, last time I bought any I bought Hanes X Temp in a size too big to err on the side of caution and they fit like a wetsuit on a whale. These, however, are very breathable, comfortable, elastic, and don't pinch at the waist or legs. I plan on buying more.",5
B00CAXS3LS,Great fit,5
B00CAXS3LS,Order for my son as he loves them. He says they fit well & are super comfortable & his fav to wear. They seem to hold up good & are of a good quality!,5
B00CAXS3LS,Good quality boxers that are soft and durable. Its very hard to find boxers like this. I quickly bought 2 more packs. Medium 165lbs. 5'11.,5
B00CAXS3LS,True to size and material is as product listing. Three pair solid color are 100% cotton and two pair Heather are 75% cotton. I have three styles of Hanes. These may prove to be my favorite!,5
B00CAXS3LS,Love this,5
B00CAXS3LS,Fit perfect and comfortably,5
B00CAXS3LS,Great I'm wearing a pair right now,5
B00CAXS3LS,Thank you very much! I really liked it,5
B00CAXS3LS,Perfection,5
B00CAXS3LS,Comfortable and last a long time.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"These are great underpants for men but I wish they were sold undyed. I had just finished reading the book To Dye For and learned that many dyes, particularly dark and blue, are toxic. So, I washed these underpants 3 times before wearing. They are not offered in white i.e. hopefully undyed or I would have bought them.",4
B00CAXS3LS,As described. Quality durable fabric. Size is a great fit.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"These are great undies, they are soft and last years!",5
B00CAXS3LS,WOULD BUY AGAIN,4
B00CAXS3LS,Realy comfortable.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Good value. Fits as expected,4
B00CAXS3LS,eh,3
B00CAXS3LS,"Since I've been wearing this brand of boxers for years and have been happy with them, when it was time for me to replenish my supply, I price-checked Amazon, found them competitive and reordered.  For an upcoming trip I would not have had enough underwear on hand unless I laundered it during my travels.  This order ensures that I'll have enough.  Soft, comfortable, roomy there is nothing I would change about these boxers.",5
B00CAXS3LS,They're comfortable.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Nice boxers, still holding up well after 5+ months.  Other reviews have complained about the size saying they're too short, but I think the size is just right.  Would definitely buy again.",5
B00CAXS3LS,"They still bunch up on you like any normal knit boxers, but they are very soft and thin and feel pretty good",4
B00CAXS3LS,Good fit. He is 6 foot and weighs 200 and we ordered size large. Just right. Hanes comes through again.,5
B00CAXS3LS,Good quality.  Size as expected,4
B00CAXS3LS,"For those who are gassy due to that In N Out daily diet. Do I have news for you. The fluff to flow ratio is amazing. Unlike other cotton briefs where fluff backlash or pressure build up ratios are of questionable pressure retention limits... these are free flowing as if u wore nothing and would let your internal fumes escape freely. Functional, flexible, and comfy. Highly recommend and for my gassy folks, pure ventilation like no other.",5
B00CAXS3LS,"The leg opening hems are constantly flipped up and it drives me nuts. Seems like Hanes should have figured that out by now. Beyond that, these are my favorite boxers.",4
B00CAXS3LS,"Boxers that do what boxers are suppose to do. No frills, no thrills... just boxers. Hanes is the go to brand. Soft, durable and elasticity remains on the waist band after hundreds of washes. Every now and then I come back and buy a couple more.Now on the bad side...When is hanes going to make single color packs on these boxers? lol...I've seen other customers complain about sometimes not being as assorted and only receiving black and grey ones... why don't you make that mistake with me? I wish I only receive the monotone colors lol. Give me a black pack, grey pack or navy pack only and i'll buy a bunch of these in one shot. I've seen you do it with the briefs but not these boxers. It's always in assorted colors. Add some dark red in there too.You give me the option to pick the colors and I won't ever buy from another brand again.",5
B00CAXS3LS,I wear this for bed and around the house. They are loose and comfy.,5
B00CAXS3LS,I like relax fit boxer so these are perfect for me. Price is very reasonable. I will buy them again for sure.,5
B00CAXS3LS,"Great feeling, comfortable boxers at a great price. Not sure why the price has doubled since I bought them though. Paid around $20 and they are at $40 now. Whatever!",5
B00CAXS3LS,"They are a t-shirt material, after the first wash they are very soft. So far so good and they're holding up well wash after wash",5
B00CAXS3LS,Very comfortable every man needs some cotton boxers,5

B01L8JJ5KC,"Super comfortable and although I have a ton of comfy hoodies, I keep choosing this one as a everyday go to when I get out of the shower and change. Looks clean and the price is so low it's almost ridiculous. Good durability as I've washed it five or six times and it shows no deterioration, it's not falling apart in any way. Hanes is a sturdy brand. I'm five minutes away from buying a second one.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,Not for cold cold weather. But that's why i got it. I get hot easily and this is thin/soft and breathable. Enough to keep me warm. Fits me great too. XL 6ft2 about 230lbs.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"Comfy, soft, cute color and style. Pilling is minimal and the sizing was perfect ( I sized up for an oversized look.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,"Very soft, looks great",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"These are perfect for those lazy days. I am a women and purchased men's because they aren't so ""fitting"" and it is the cheapest, most comfortable things I own now. I will be purchasing more!",5
B01L8JJ5KC,Actually the material feels comfortable and it has a comfortable fit too. However the waist elastic is way loose and the whole sweatshirt just falls down like wearing a sack. Fruit of the loom has a much better waist elastic that keeps it looking fit around the waist.,3
B01L8JJ5KC,Fits alright. Just needed a cheap sweatshirt and this fits the bill. Washes fine. Wear under my hi vis so while changing oil at work this gets dirty instead of my hi vis jacket which is impossible as it is to keep clean. Black so fits the style I need.,4
B01L8JJ5KC,"50/50 blend, so not what you want in frigid weather.  But come Spring or Fall, it'll do---especially for the price.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,Great quality and will order again,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"Basic comfy go-to type sweater. It's not good for cold days, but you can layer up.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"These are so soft, great fit and comfy.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"Las Vegas weather, the ultimate magician, with a climate change trick that would make Houdini proud! One day you're melting on the Strip, and the next, you're rummaging through the closet for that elusive 'light sweater'. It's like Mother Nature is playing a high-stakes game of poker, and she's got a royal flush of seasons up her sleeve. And just when you think you've got the weather figured out, bam! It's sweater weather, and you're left wondering if you missed a memo. But hey, at least the delivery game is strong, with Amazon swooping in faster than a Las Vegas wedding chapel. Now you're cozied up in record time, ready to face the brisk desert winds with style and comfort. Who needs a fall season when you've got speedy deliveries and the perfect fit?",5
B01L8JJ5KC,loved material,5
B01L8JJ5KC,The fit was perfect the color's great. The service from Amazon was excellent. Delivery was prompt and all in all satisfied with the package and the product and the price. Thank you Amazon,5
B01L8JJ5KC,This was a great comfortable basic sweatshirt and I find myself wearing in more than I thought. would buy another.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,so soft and comfy. ordered another color as well .,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Like the fit,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"Great price, so soft and comfortable! Can dress up easily",5
B01L8JJ5KC,Very nice,5
B01L8JJ5KC,I like these and had to order another. I want all the colors,5
B01L8JJ5KC,EXACTLY WHAT i WANTED!!!,4
B01L8JJ5KC,Was just thanked again for this sweeter. Has a two layer thick layer of fleece. Is a decent sweeter for the price. They wear it often and say it is cozy.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Just what I was looking for. I got a size up so it can fit oversized.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Looks great and is warm and comfortable. Made well.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Shrunk,3
B01L8JJ5KC,Thin material,3
B01L8JJ5KC,"super fit,feels great!",5
B01L8JJ5KC,Fast shipping and product as described !,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Great price,3
B01L8JJ5KC,This fleece pullover is soft and comfortable.  I use it in the early mornings when I'm sitting on the patio in the cool morning air.  Recommended.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"It's an affordable sweatshirt.I would recommend it more for spring than for summer.I wear it almost every day; it saves me when I don't feel like putting on a casual t-shirt.It's very thin, so I wouldn't recommend wearing it in autumn or winter.For the 10-15 dollars it cost me, what more can you ask for?",4
B01L8JJ5KC,Bought for my husband.  He loves them. Great material.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,The T shirt showed it to be a rich brown color. When it came it was a dull brown that was at all even near the color,3
B01L8JJ5KC,fits ok I am afraid to wash it,3
B01L8JJ5KC,Comfy - worth it,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Excelente,5
B01L8JJ5KC,What you expect from a sweater. Decent quality. Fits well.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"They run small, very comfortable.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,Just a basic sweatshirt. Fairly lightweight and fits comfortably,5
B01L8JJ5KC,confort and warm,5
B01L8JJ5KC,This sweatshirt is thin and shrank a lot.  I guess eco means inferior because the other Hanes sweatshirt I got was so much better.  Size up if you want a more relaxed fit.,2
B01L8JJ5KC,Very tight around the wrists. Ok if you never pull your sleeves up like I do.,2
B01L8JJ5KC,"I'm a 5'7 woman who's 220. I got XL for a perfect comfortable oversized sweater. I got XXL for wearing inside as my comfy pajama sweater. The bottom hem isn't too tight, and I can wear it loose enough.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,Muy bien,4
B01L8JJ5KC,"This sweater fits good, is comfortable, but is surprisingly thin. I guess you get what you pay for.It's hard to determine online if clothing like sweaters will feel warm. This sweater is warmer than a long-sleeve t-shirt, but not a whole lot. I have other sweaters that keep me much warmer. That being said, it's a good sweater to have if you want to dress in layers. It's not made for the colder days of winter, but if you wear a t-shirt under the sweater, and a jacket over it, which is what I currently do, it's a good buy for the price. Just don't expect it to keep you warm when the temperature is around 50 degrees or less. For those days 50 degrees to just under 70, it does the job when wearing a jacket over it.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,Very happy with quality,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Husband likes  Hanes sweatshirts for working or casual wear. Fit and look great. He is happy!,5
B01L8JJ5KC,If you wear a large order a large,4
B01L8JJ5KC,Great fit,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Fast shipping and just as described. Thank you!,5
B01L8JJ5KC,I need these shirts for the gym. The size is a good fit.  The inner lining gives the shirt luxurious comfort. My wife says I can wear it visit friends because it fits well and looks good. I just ordered four more!,5
B01L8JJ5KC,This is a very good basic sweat shirt. I got this for a man I cared for in his home and it kept him warm.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Runs large,4
B01L8JJ5KC,Terrible sweatshirt! So stretched out at the bottom. Makes you look like a slob,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"I bought this sweater for my partner for Christmas, and man, I am so glad I did. It's so soft and cozy, and looks great on him!I bought him an XL, he usually wears a L but he's been lifting weights so I wanted him to have something to grow into.He immediately spilled pasta sauce on it, of course, but I washed & dried it inside-out, which helps keep the inside soft and prevents pilling, and it's still a great size and fit. I might order a smaller size for myself, I'm sure it would look just as good on a girl, and it's just so cozy that I can't resist :)",5
B01L8JJ5KC,The sweater itself is fine and very comfortable. My only issue is that they sent me a 2XL instead of an XL. I kept it anyway since I would just be using it during exercise.,4
B01L8JJ5KC,Fits true to size. Thinner material but warm enough for mild fall or winter days. The length isn't bad but needs to be longer for shrinkage. Pretty good for the price.  Edit. The black fit well but the royal blue was smaller and quite wide at the waist. These shirts are not created equal,4
B01L8JJ5KC,"Very soft, fits well and great value",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"These were too small for me. Seem like a basic sweatshirt but an XL, which I normally am an XL, runs like a large. Make sure to size up when you're ordering.",3
B01L8JJ5KC,They are thick and keep the cold out so when I wear these during the winter I don't need to wear anything else but an under shirt. Only complaint I have is that the sleeves are too long but  I'm a female so it was to be expected.,4
B01L8JJ5KC,"Ok I kinda feel I could have just gone to Walmart to buy this but due to a Chronic back issue im greatful to beable to turn on computer and click the buy button.This is a typical Sweat Shirt,great for my Son to wear while working outside.The neck is a bit constricted but seems to have stretched out.Normally we buy Carhartt but this is suitable for his line of work since it will definitely get destroyed in a matter of a few months.I bought Carhartt brand which is better and much warmer but these are ok for Fall or to wear under coat etc.Price point good for this brand.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,"I originally bought a grey sweater and then two weeks later bought the black one. They are super comfy, not overly heavy. I usually wear a L/XL and bought an XL, it fit perfectly. I couldn't find the black one for a few weeks until I saw my teenage daughter darting out the door with it on, so it looks like I'll be buying more.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,This was a perfect light crewneck to throw on during the fall weather. I went a size up for a more loose fit.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"My boyfriend is 6,1 got an xl and it fits him good the only down side is the fuzz on the inside gets onto shirts. Sure after a few washes it will stop. Other than that, perfect.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,"Wanted a comfortable, XL black sweatshirt. This is it. Fit was fine.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"Received a shirt that had clearly been worn and absolutely REEKS of perfume, I have allergies to certain scents and this was so strong it gave me a headache. NOT a normal dye scent, clearly perfume.",1
B01L8JJ5KC,i recommend for the man in yr life true to size xl is so perfect and black is a nice color to match and color pants yr wear 10/10 recommend,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"I got this to go jogging but ended up wearing it to sleep in instead. I usually actually wear a large in shirts but got an XL here to make sure it wasn't too small. It's smaller than I would have thought it would be and seems to have gotten shorter after washing and drying. It's not too tight, just creeps up on my back of I bend over too far. It's not really horrible, just wish it were a little longer.  After the second wash a lot of the backing bunched up and came loose but I guess that probably happens with all polyester fleece. I probably wouldn't wear this out in public.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,"Good mid-weight sweatshirt; not too thin, but not overly bulky.Only Cons:-Tight around the neck and wrists. If you have thick neck/wrists/triceps this will be uncomfortable.-Will shrink a bit. May want to size up.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,I really like it but should have got a different size.,4
B01L8JJ5KC,My teens love this sweatshirt. They own it in several colors. High quality.,5
B01L8JJ5KC,Very comfortable,5
B01L8JJ5KC,"I wanted to get a nice basic sweater to layer my outfits. I bought a bigger size so that I could get an oversized look. I'm about 5'5, 125lbs and when I usually buy oversized sweaters they usually only go to my booty because of how long my torso is. This fit great and looked exactly the way that I wanted it. The material isn't the type to attract a lot of dog hair unless you're rolling in it, and it's easy to lintroll off. The sleeves also are long enough to scrunch up in the way that I like, and the cuff keeps it from going past my hands so I don't need to roll them up.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"I've bought Hanes sweatshirts for many years, and they are the best. Lightweight, comfortable, good price, and they get better as they age. I always buy a size larger than I usually wear for a loose comfortable fit.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,"no elastic at the neck area, stays misshapen",3
B01L8JJ5KC,"After reading some of the reviews, I was convinced to purchase this sweater. Upon arrival,  I tried it on & the neck was pretty small but After washing it & after stretching the neck a bit, it feels comfortable to wear. The color it super black, which is perfect. The material is soft on the inside & a lil rough on the outside. Its not too loose. I'm 5'9 & wear an XL & like to wear somewhat slim fit clothes so this sweater was perfect for my taste. I gave it ""4 stars"" because of the whole neck issue but I'm going to purchase another sweater & see if maybe its just that sweater.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,Comfortable through the chest and waist. Plenty of room and comfortable tomove around in. Only negative is the sleeves get tight around the forearm down to the wrist.,4
B01L8JJ5KC,"On the one hand, it's cheap and comfortable. On the other hand, it wont last long. Mine started to get mealy after the first wash.",4
B01L8JJ5KC,"Not comfortable, rather hard and stiff material.",2
B01L8JJ5KC,"Very soft, nice product but runs small. My bf wears a medium/large but glad I ordered XL, fits right just perfect amount of room.",5
B01L8JJ5KC,Needed some new sweatshirts and they were just what I was looking for at a decent price,5
B01L8JJ5KC,I love this,4
B01MY0TETQ,These socks are well-made.  They are thick and comfortable.  I've been wearing them for a while and walk around in sock feet at home in them.  They have shown no signs of wearing out after a year.  I'll be getting more!,5
B01MY0TETQ,"This is a high-quality sock.  I bought the size 6-12 and they fit my 12.5"" feet (I have a narrow foot though).  They are thick and soft and stay up well on my leg without making marks in the skin.  I would definitely buy again.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"warm, comfortable and and excellent fit.  I'll buy them again but it won't be soon because they seem like they will wear very well.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"These socks are very comfortable if you are going for hikes in colder climates or shoveling snow. Any other time they are too warm for normal wear. I have no issues with them, they are sturdy, well made and thick. I just didn't realize that when I bought them, so it is more my fault.Recommend for people looking for thick, warm socks, but if you are looking for something for running or everyday wear in warmer climates, I would look for something else.",4
B01MY0TETQ,"Im retired and usually wear white socks, so I buy a bunch of the same ones so I dont have to sort/couple them after washing.  When they wear out so there's less than 7 pairs, I buy more of the same style if available, or two new sets if it's a new pattern.  I happily used Hanes for years, but the recent batch is made of something different and does not feel good on my feet.  It was the same through Amazon or buying directly from store.  These were cheap so I tried them.  They fit perfectly (size 8 1/2 shoe, got the 6-12's), they are thick and warm and comfy. They stay in place when walking.  They seem to breathe fine, I have not had sweaty feet using them despite the thickness.  I bought them in autumn and haven't tried them on a really hot day.  There have been a couple of warm days (80s) here and of course I went walking in the woods, they were fine.  If they turn out to be too hot in summer I will update this, but I am quite satisfied so far.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"have had these socks for over a year and a half and there are still no holes in them.  considering how my husband goes through socks due to holes, these are well worth the money and they are comfortable as well.  definitely a must buy!",5
B01MY0TETQ,I love these socks.  I have bought this item three times now.  Pretty much the only sock I wear now.  I have had zero issue with wearing holes in them.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"These socks are so comfortable! Better yet, I have arthritis in my fingers and really struggle to get some socks on and off, these socks are so stretchy they just slip right on. Very happy with them!",5
B01MY0TETQ,"OMG - THESE ARE NICE - JUST RECEIVEDOrdering Another pack ""now"" before sale ends - bruh these are the bomb comfortable",5
B01MY0TETQ,These are very well made.  Warm and comfortable.  I will purchase these again.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"Socks fit perfect are great moisture wicking, soft breathable comfortable stretch, great durability & have slip resistance!",5
B01MY0TETQ,"Sewn very well, comfortable, good support.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"These are definitely much thicker than most other common brands. At first, they felt kind of stiff, but softened after a few washes. Now they are very comfortable, especially for cold weather.",5
B01MY0TETQ,Son loves them!,5
B01MY0TETQ,Comfortable,5
B01MY0TETQ,Great fit and comfort,5
B01MY0TETQ,Thicker than other socks. Finally a sock that isn't whisky thin . durable. Going on two years holding up well. I'm going to stockpile these and throw out the old ones. For awhile they were out of stock and I tried the cheapest car hart those were too small to wear. I'm going to buy enough of these to last a lifetime,5
B01MY0TETQ,Good,5
B01MY0TETQ,These socks are amazing. The best socks I've ever purchased. They stay in shape and looking great for months.  I will keep buying these for my husband as long as they are available.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"Calcetines gruesos y acolchados, me encantaron",5
B01MY0TETQ,"Love these socks, they fit great, durable and breathable, yet warm. The only complaint is that the black fabric inside pills and gets everywhere.",4
B01MY0TETQ,"i'm sock picky. these were said to b lg and they are not, they squeeze my feet. they are well-made.",4
B01MY0TETQ,As described. Bought another batch to save for next year too!,5
B01MY0TETQ,"My husband has diabetes, painful feet, and looks for cushion work socks. These are totally pleasing for him.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"Durable, comfortable, not too hot.Been using them for 2 years daily and they're still going strong.I would give them a 10 if I could!I bought them twice and 4 of us use them.Buy these socks!",5
B01MY0TETQ,Has good support for the value.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"I first bought these back in 2020 and have always loved these socks.I would purposely overlook all of my other socks to find these to wear.I searched all over because I couldn't remember where I bought them or even the name brand.Thankfully,a few weeks ago I found them again.If you buy these socks,you'll love them and never buy anything else.They fit like a glove and are very comfortable. Buy them now!",5
B01MY0TETQ,I was getting him the blue ones and they didnt have them this year. And he likes them. When he works at the golf course mowing in the spring Im sure they wont hide the green grass as well but theyr comfy,5
B01MY0TETQ,Fits perfectly,5
B01MY0TETQ,"I DO NOT HAVE A PHOTO OF THE SOCKS. I'VE HAD THEM SINCE JANUARY 2023, AND I'M BUYING MORE TODAY, 11/3. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. I WORK IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS AS A KITCHEN MANAGER. I AM ON MY FEET 12+ HOURS A DAY, AND THEY ARE GREAT; YES, THEIR THICK, BUT THE COMFORT SETS  IT. SOME STARTED TO GET HOLES IN THE TOE AREA, BUT NOT A LOT AND SOME PAIRS HUGGED THE CALF. I LIKE THEM A LOT, AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM. RETURN THEM IN 30 DAYS, SO WHAT THE PROBLEM? GIVE THEM A TRY",5
B01MY0TETQ,"I love these, the toe and heels are reinforced and I have yet to wear out a pair. They stay up even after many washings!",5
B01MY0TETQ,"Inexpensive, good moisture wicking, and durable.  Fit is good. One negative is the inside seam at the toe rubs and is uncomfortable.  I've had to turn the socks inside out in order to wear them.  Not recommended.",3
B01MY0TETQ,These regular socks are more thick and soft then your usual socks very good quality I'm very happy with my purchase probably the best socks I've ever had i will definitely purchase again I dislike polyester doesn't let your skin breathe going to see if they have some really cold weather socks for motorcycle riding in winter,5
B01MY0TETQ,Nice socks a little thin but overall good!,4
B01MY0TETQ,"Socks are slip resistant, the correct size very durable , very comfortable, very well made and would definitely buy again.",5
B01MY0TETQ,In my 50+ years of life I have NEVER EVER HAD SUCH COZY AND COMFY SOCKS!!!!THEY ARE JUST THE RIGHT THICKNESS FOR MY COWBOY BOOTS!!!THESE SOCKS ARE A SUPER DUPER BLESSING!,5
B01MY0TETQ,"These are great socks. They fit well , easy to put on, easy to stretch , and hold shape well , so very durable.  I didn't order knee socks but they were high enough for what I wanted.",5
B01MY0TETQ,By far the best socks I've ever had. Very comfortable and durable.,5
B01MY0TETQ,My husband loves these socks their the only ones he wants..,5
B01MY0TETQ,good,5
B01MY0TETQ,"Usually just buy and expect cheap socks at cheap price. These were way beyond expectations. Very thick and comfortable. Form fit to shape of foot, definitely not just tube socks. Highly recommend.",5
B01MY0TETQ,Good quality but quite thick,4
B01MY0TETQ,". . . . . but then after a few washings, they begin to pill all over. Going to try washing inside-out to see if it does it less. Saw some info to add vinegar but I'm not willing to go that far. Comfortable and value pretty good.",3
B01MY0TETQ,These are very thin compared to normal socks. Offer no padding or anything special so I'm not sure what products other reviewers are using. These are thin!,3
B01MY0TETQ,Very nice socks with a Cushing feel,5
B01MY0TETQ,I go through a lot of white socks and most of them are too thin and uncomfortable and twist on your feet and these are thick but not too thick comfortable and they don't twist at all. I will be ordering more of these soon.,5
B01MY0TETQ,like that it has two colors,4
B01MY0TETQ,"I've been buying these for ages now but for some reason they aren't as absorbent as normal. I think they added polyester to the mix because I never had this issue before. I still have my last batch and side by side one foot gets that ""slimey"" feeling and the other doesn't. The label says there's a bit of polyester in there now and I don't think it was there before. If it was, then something else changed. Disappointing.If you don't mind polyester, then everything else is fine. I'm size 11 and the sock fits as expected. Previously they have last quite a long time until the heel gets a hole. The rest of the sock is usually still fine though so you can oatch them if you're into that.",3
B01MY0TETQ,"These are THICK socks, very comfortable.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"I thought these would be like the one I got a few years ago those were great. These are the closes I could find and in the right size. I wanted wool, easily to put on, and in a big size to be worn in the cold.. I really liked you older stuff.",4
B01MY0TETQ,"Thickness is just the way I like (not real thick, but not real thin to wear a hole), with good cushion at the bottom. Launders well and the elastic stays tight around the leg, but not too tight; feels just right. The black socks are true black and the white socks with grey/black are true to color as well. Glad I got this 10 pack.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"My husband wears size 12-13 shoe and it's always been difficult to find socks that will fit his feet that I don't have to pay a small fortune for. These feet his feet perfectly, and the best part is he likes them!",5
B01MY0TETQ,these are better than the last Hanes I bought there're thicker and better madeget them before the embargo,5
B01MY0TETQ,College age son preferred these socks when working on his feet this summer for 40+ hours per wk. Provides good comfort and support.,5
B01MY0TETQ,Well made and fit well too.  Very comfkortable.  Nice and thick and add comfort when walking. They are now on my list of standard products that I will buy again as needed.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"I really recommend this product, fits perfectly very durable and the color is great",5
B01MY0TETQ,EnerWear 10 Pk. are the best cotton socks  I ever bought. I use to buy Gold Toe but the quality went way down. These socks are well made and far better quality than Gold Toe. You can't go wrong owing a 10 pk.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"Worth the money, true to size, not a hiking sock, average cushioning",5
B01MY0TETQ,These socks are like the kind I grew up with...thick comfortable and long lasting. My wife stole half of the ones I ordered so I'm going to order more,5
B01MY0TETQ,Nice socks that fit well and last.,5
B01MY0TETQ,These socks fit great and should hold up well,4
B01MY0TETQ,Great thick pair of socks. I will be getting more,5
B01MY0TETQ,"These are well made, not to thick and not to thin, these are in the middle and they hold up well, I wear mine with work boots and I got 3 years out of them before holes started, usually anything else im lucky to get 3 months out of before they get holes in them.",5
B01MY0TETQ,Very comfortable and well made socks and at a reasonable price.,5
B01MY0TETQ,Love socks that dont rip or make holes from my big toe and after many wears and a few months these are holding up perfectly.  Very comfortable and true to fit size  They stay up nicely and I love!!!,5
B01MY0TETQ,"Comfortable fit,  true to size, hold up after washing, great price",5
B01MY0TETQ,I ordered these for my husband and he loved them! They are very good quality and fit him perfectly.,5
B01MY0TETQ,Heavy weight and durability. I wear these everyday to work. On my feet 90 % of the day and walking on construction sites. They get washed every week and I have had them for several months. Still in great shape. Always comfortable to put on. Thickly woven and just the right amount of stretch.,5
B01MY0TETQ,Very comfortable fit.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"I bought their other, similar socks and they were acceptable.Here.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY0TETQ?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_5&th=1&psc=1EnerWear 10P Pack Unisex Cotton Moisture Wicking Cushion Crew SocksVisit the EnerWear StoreBut these socks are horrible for me.  I have a size 12/13 shoe and these socks are too tight.This may be partially my fault as I know from experience that 10-13 SOCK sizes are problem.But even so, the toe on this sock is just wrong. Squish.I try and buy ""Big And Tall""  Haynes but they don't always have a high enough cotton content for me.I would return the package but I've already opened it.Be warned.",2
B01MY0TETQ,"These have been holding up very well over the past year.  They are a little large to fit.  They also have had balls of material on the inside build up, but after a year, I'll deal with it.  They hold their color.  Good moisture wicking. If your on the fence, go for them.  They are much better than other socks I have bought.",4
B01MY0TETQ,"These socks disappeared from Amazon for a couple of years. While they were gone I tried other brands, well known brands, that were no where near as comfortable, or as easy to get on. Very happy these are back. Highly recommended.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"I do like the look and feel of these socks.  They are warm and comfortable, but not too hot on these warmer southern afternoon.I wear a 9.5 shoe and these socks are a bit looser around the foot than similar socks, but they do hold okay above the ankle.  Perhaps a few more washings might snug them up a bit.",4
B01MY0TETQ,"These socks are so comfortable, well made, and perfect,",5
B01MY0TETQ,My husband liked them.,5
B01MY0TETQ,"works great, just what I needed",5
B01MY0TETQ,I purchased these socks and they felt pretty good but when I went and put my old socks on that I used to wear I realized these socks are a lot better than I thought now these are the only socks I wear,5
B01MY0TETQ,The socks fit perfectly,5
B01MY0TETQ,"These are a heavy weight in my opinion, winter socks here in Ohio. It is too soon to say much, thus the 3 star rating, since I just got them. They feel good but with socks, only time will tell. They are made better, more durable, than most socks you get from big box stores. The 10-13 sock size and the 6-12 shoe size fit my 10 1/2 x-wide feet perfectly. Anyone with a size 9 shoe or smaller will swim in these. I may go back and forth to Fruit of The Loom if they ever go back to using more cotton but will probably NOT go back to Hanes as long as I can get these.  Well worth the price.",4
B01MY0TETQ,good,5
B01MY0TETQ,"My order for these socks just came in, so I've only worn them for a few days.  They are just like they were advertised  and have been a great product so far.  I'm 80 years old, so I have to be careful about wearing any sock that affects my circulation in my ankle area.  These socks stay up through all kinds of activity but don't bind my lower leg or cause any circulation problems.  I've tried many brands trying to find one that stays in place without any restriction but these are the only ones I've tried that do that.",5
B01MY0TETQ,"If you're not a fan of a thick sock, don't purchase these socks.  They might be good if it's cold outside but during hot weather your feet will get hot.  They do wash well and wear well so far.",3
B01MY0TETQ,I like to fit,4
B01MY0TETQ,Very soft and comfortable. I love them.,5
B01MY0TETQ,They feel great and very Kushy.,4
B01MY0TETQ,"Love the feel of these socks on my feet, not so tight on the toes. I do wish the top of the sock at the calve was just a little bigger. A lot of these sock companies seem to think people have small calves or something. I am pleased with these socks though!",5
B01MY0TETQ,They're cotton impact men's working socks called cowboy blue color they fit perfectly and they don't heat up your feet don't you love Amazon,5
B01MY0TETQ,"I can tell the difference in the last package of socks I received they are not as thick or tightly woven as the previous orders I have place, the knitting pattern has also changed again. The socks are still okay but not as good as they once were IMO. I will now shop more before I buy more socks, again the socks are still good.",4
B07NKRC7QR,Nothing special but does the job. Fits well and generally I find this model lasts me several years. I personally like the cotton feel. Would recommend.,5
B07NKRC7QR,Worth the price.,5
B07NKRC7QR,Comfortable,5
B07NKRC7QR,"Slightly tighter fit than expected, but okay.Great quality.",4
B07NKRC7QR,"Love these underwear, the fit is great and makes you feel good wearing them",5
B07NKRC7QR,It is not easy to find cotton in a recycled poly world. excellent choice.,5
B07NKRC7QR,"The quality seemed good, but I am disappointed that the box came broken, as I wanted to gift these.",4
B07NKRC7QR,"Comfortable, good fit, good quality and like the colors.",4
B07NKRC7QR,good,5
B07NKRC7QR,Great product,5
B07NKRC7QR,"I was bored of only black boxers, I'm glad to find blue colors, the only thing that doesn't make them perfect is the material, it's a bit fragile, Calvin Klein should make them in thicker and more elastic cotton.",4
B07NKRC7QR,Arrived fast and in great condition,5
B07NKRC7QR,My son in law was Happy,5
B07NKRC7QR,These are our go to for my kids! They will loose shape due to no stretch.,4
B07NKRC7QR,Thought they were thin,4
B07NKRC7QR,"Good underwear, size is accurate, comfortable undies.  You can tell they are good quality and will last a while.  A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.",4
B07NKRC7QR,Work underwear for support .,4
B07NKRC7QR,"Good quality, I guess this underwear material is pure cotton",5
B07NKRC7QR,Very comfortable but wore out in crotch area after 4 months. I own two packs of these and many other boxer briefs so they were spread out far in the rotation and still wore out extremely quickly. If you want durability and comfort just spend the extra money and get some icebreaker brand merino wool boxer briefs.,3
B07NKRC7QR,Nice!!!,4
B07NKRC7QR,like the fit,5
B07NKRC7QR,Super soft and comfortable,5
B07NKRC7QR,Ya los he comprado varias veces . Me gustan mucho.  Son para mi hijo y son de muy buena calidad .  La tela es fresca,5
B07NKRC7QR,"Good fit and comfort. Some pilling on the inside after 15-20 wash cycles, but they still look good and hold their shape. The fabric is a bit rough to the touch, but not uncomfortable to wear. Quite breathable.These are the closest to the fit of the old CK microfiber trunks I could find, although the fabric is very different of course. This classic cut is my favorite-- not excessively tight boxer-briefs, not the ""biker short"" versions that go nearly to your knees. Something in between, but not loose like woven boxers.I'd think this would be popular, but it turned out to be hard to find.The microfiber version I loved doesn't seem to exist now, since CK seems to drop products every couple of years. Rebranding constantly might seem smart to their marketing folks but practically it makes it unnecessarily complicated to restock a favorite. I ended up having to try a half-dozen variants to find 2 that were similar to what I was still buying 2-4 years prior. Inefficient, and wasteful-- since the other 4 variants were returns.Good fit, good durability, looks nice, needs no special care. Recommended.",4
B07NKRC7QR,They stretch out rather fast but other than that no complaints.,4
B07NKRC7QR,"Love these underwear, only kind I wear",5
B07NKRC7QR,Fit well and comfortable,5
B07NKRC7QR,Great fit and I like waist band.,5
B07NKRC7QR,Cumple con lo comprado,5
B07NKRC7QR,I returned these as I was given the same item as a gift. The black stay put and fit well after washing and drying. Other colors do not. Get the kind with 5% stretch if you want grey or white. The white and grey were both much lighter weight and stretch out badly. Black is best.,5
B07NKRC7QR,"Calvin Klein, always the best holds up and fits well.",5
B07NKRC7QR,100% algodo,4
B07NKRC7QR,"My husband loves them. Fits as expected. the more you wash them, the softer they get.",5
B07NKRC7QR,"Excelentes, de buena calidad",5
B07NKRC7QR,"I prefer to buy the packages on sale. I order cotton stretch boxer briefs, and sometimes I receive 100% cotton, instead.",4
B07NKRC7QR,Fiel a la imagen muy satisfecha,5
B07NKRC7QR,Nice underwear. The size is a bit bigger than other brands. I would choose a smaller size next time.,5
B07NKRC7QR,Quality is great. Elastic lasts.,5
B07NKRC7QR,Excelente,5
B07NKRC7QR,Talla corresponde,4
B07NKRC7QR,"Just what i needed. M fits perfect, 120 pounds 5'8",5
B07NKRC7QR,I bought this for my teen son once he got into Calvin Klein underwear. I specifically bought this product because it was black and it was 100% cotton. They do tend to last a long time so I may purchase more in the future if he wears the others out eventually.,5
B07NKRC7QR,"After trying Gildan, Hanes, Amazon Essentials, and a couple others these fit just right....finally!  Others were either too tight or too loose.  Everyone is different so YMMV.  I'm 6'4"" wear either L or XL.  These work best as XL for me.Had perfect fitting underwear from Kohl's under their store brand and then they stopped selling them.  So after wearing out the last pair went searching on Amazon for underwear.",5
B07NKRC7QR,I've been putting off getting these due to the price but now regret doing so. These are by far some of the nicest briefs I have every purchased.,5
B07NKRC7QR,"Hitting the magic point on underpants that are made of natural fibers so you don't get crotch rot, and also have enough elasticity to grab hold where you want them to is really really complicated.These should be considered a good enough respite choice for when you are recovered enough to begin your search for the perfect underpants again.They are fine. They are kind of boring looking. Not sexy, yet not the kind of thing you'd feel shame over being seen in..I personally like the ones that have some synthetic in them to make them stretch more, and also have a slight cup sewn to the crotch so things are gently held in place, but not reminiscent of actual bondage.These are riiiight between old fashioned boxers and those kind.The waist band is narrower than fancier brand names, and somehow that makes them also feel cheaper.. Well. They are.I'm a waist size of 34 which according to their size chart would make me a medium, yet large fits much better, and still snugs to my thighs and doesn't ride up. I'm perhaps slightly more than medium muscularity, if that should help anyone out.. Not a brag.I'm happy to purchase these, while window shopping the thousands of Japanese underpant brands that are for some reason now available.. Good enough. That'll do pig..",4
B07NKRC7QR,My 22 year old son has worn CK most of his life,5
B07NKRC7QR,"Very comfortable, stretchy material.",5
B07NKRC7QR,Fast dispatch and delivery to ROI. Excellent quality items. The 100% cotton is ideal for comfort.,5
B07NKRC7QR,"Me gustan, se ajusta bien, buen material y de buena calidad",5
B07NKRC7QR,Great quality and good price,5
B07NKRC7QR,No rolling up quality is good Comfort is good no holes holds a shape,5
B07NKRC7QR,I have expensive CK underwear and I finally tried these because they are cotton. These are by far my favorite from the Calvin Klein line,5
B07NKRC7QR,I bought Xl and definitely like the fitness and comfort of them. Definitely worth it and buying more of them,5
B07NKRC7QR,"fit, comfort, quality, and good price!",5
B07NKRC7QR,"High quality, will last, they fit well, good color selection",5
B07NKRC7QR,Waist expansion is great BUT distance from Waist to crotch to short. Seemed to bottom out before being totally up. This caused elastic to roll and some discomfort.,4
B07NKRC7QR,Good quality though,5
B07NKRC7QR,Fits well and is really soft and comfortable.,5
B07NKRC7QR,Shorts shrunk significantly after first washing almost to bikini size. Can't wear them. They are too tight.,2
B07NKRC7QR,It has been hard to find comfortable briefs that have a longer rise. I thought this was a perfect fit until being washed. Material was still soft but they shrunk a lot making them uncomfortable.,2
B07NKRC7QR,I feel like these use to be nicer but they still do the trick.,4
B07NKRC7QR,"My partner loves them, he says they're comfortable.",5
B07NKRC7QR,These are the greatest fit and very comfortable,5
B07NKRC7QR,Cotton material. Purchase it for the logo!,5
B07NKRC7QR,I have been trying to find Calvin Klein oxer briefs 100 % cotton...found them on amazon..took them out and they are that sleepry rayon EVEN THO box says 100% cotton..don't buy,2
B07NKRC7QR,REAL material NOT PLASTIC,5
B07NKRC7QR,"All ok, fabric feels nice. They are a bit big, advise to go for lower sizes",5
B07NKRC7QR,nice,5
B07NKRC7QR,"He wears these all the time! However, he has told me that he can't wear them while playing sports because, well, they're not very secure... down there. If you just want a comfortable pair of boxers though, these are great for their value!",5
B07NKRC7QR,"Ive been purchasing for the past 2 years. Amazing quality, comfy and as described. Never had an issue with product or seller.",5

B07NKRC7QR,Nice fitting underwear. Would not expect anything different from Calvin Klein,4
B07NKRC7QR,Fit and feel great.,4
B07NKRC7QR,All good,5
B004QO7MG6,"A brand that's been around forever because of its consistent quality, fit and durability. My husband is 78 years old. I like the Hanes brand because I can wash them in hot water, use bleach and still get long wear out of them. The price point is reasonable, and that's a good thing for several reasons. Not to be too graphic, but sometimes I throw the underwear away rather than wash them. Also, I like for him to have 2-3 weeks of daily clean briefs because things happen, and I don't always get his laundry done on schedule. I absolutely can't stand dingy and frayed underwear. In my opinion, we can't feel our best when we're wearing ratty underwear.Price, quality and comfort, Hanes cotton briefs is a good choice.",5
B004QO7MG6,Very good quality & comfortable to wear.  True to size.  Price was good,5
B004QO7MG6,"Size is true to fit, and will last at least nine months for regular use and washing this is my second purchase. Yes, they have changed slightly as far as the thickness of material like everything else but still OK for the money.",4
B004QO7MG6,"... because after all the strange undies which Amazon has provided; sometimes a return to basics in indicated ;)~ with something about ""go far enough out and normal is again festive!Seriously though - these [along with FOTL, natch] really are the standard by which ""ordinary underwear"" should be judges.No tags or scratchy inlays on the waistband and some of the smoothest & comfortable cotton to found anywhere on the Big Blue Marble.Fit is lovely and true to what this Big Boy [for now, anyway] needs as a kinda roomy but also nicely snug.Ordering some for the Godson so a review from a younger perspective will update this is needed.RECOMMENDED - add a little ordinary into your undies drawer today.Cheers from Texas,Billy",5

B004QO7MG6,Quality is ok,4
B004QO7MG6,Good product at a good price. These did shrink when I washed and dried them. I'd recommend buying one size larger if you plan on throwing them in the dryer. If I buy again I'll definitely buy one size larger so my testies have more fun.,4
B004QO7MG6,Always been my brand and this was a great buy.,5
B004QO7MG6,I have both. These are comfortable and priced where I can replace them every two years. You never know when your underware will show.,4
B004QO7MG6,Great item,5
B004QO7MG6,"My husband's underwear were starting to look well worn so I shopped online and found these underwear.  I ordered them in 2XL as he has a 44-46"" waistline and they fit perfect.  He put them on this morning and he says they're very comfortable and fit perfect.  I'll be buying him another package soon.  He highly recommends these underwear for fit and comfort.",5
B004QO7MG6,Fits,5
B004QO7MG6,Totally get  what you buy,4
B004QO7MG6,Fit well. Comfortable,5
B004QO7MG6,Comfortable good quality and price good,5
B004QO7MG6,"If you ever bought a four or five pack Hanes underwear, you will notice the difference.  These bigger pack (almost the same price) it's not as soft or thicker than the other pack.  Time will tell if the quality and durability of the underwear, I'll update if I see changes.",4
B004QO7MG6,Fit and feel great,5
B004QO7MG6,This brand is the best! Quality and comfort you can always count!,5
B004QO7MG6,Not yet used but we trust Haines for fit and quality,5
B004QO7MG6,Fits great. More durable than the other brand everyone knows. The material is much better. The stitching seams solid. Wonderful fit.,5
B004QO7MG6,Great fit and reasonable price.,5
B004QO7MG6,I like them very much.,5
B004QO7MG6,Fit well,4
B004QO7MG6,"These were not made with the thick, absorbent cloth that is usually in Hanes briefs. Very disappointed.",3
B004QO7MG6,Fits as designed.  Does not droop or sag,4
B004QO7MG6,while it is still a good brand the cotton is very thin and after about 10 washes it can be seen through. Waistband out lasts the body. Value priced for amount ordered.,4
B004QO7MG6,These underwear are super comfortable. They are made well and have held up nicely. The fit is perfect. 5/5 will definitely buy more.,5
B004QO7MG6,They are just like some older ones.  Fit nice and of course they have a lot more body to them than the 27 year old ones I have (not really 27 but you get the idea).,5
B004QO7MG6,Would purchase this product again.,5
B004QO7MG6,Comfy an wash well,5
B004QO7MG6,The best made,5
B004QO7MG6,"I am a size large but usually get a size up when buying Briefs because I hate when they are super tight. These are 100% cotton so no plastic and they shrunk a bit, but not much. Im happy with them and would recommend.",4
B004QO7MG6,The briefs are doing what they were designed to do.,4
B004QO7MG6,"Made in China for men of (ahem) smaller stature, they don't quite do the job.",3
B004QO7MG6,Comfortable underwear!,5
B004QO7MG6,good product!,4
B004QO7MG6,Underwear well made and 6 pairs for less than $11 is great.,5
B004QO7MG6,Buen material.,5
B004QO7MG6,"I've been wearing these briefs for a few weeks now, and I have to say, they've been a solid choice for daily wear. Right out of the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the material - it's soft and feels durable, which is exactly what I look for in underwear. After several washes, they've held up well, retaining their shape and color without any noticeable shrinkage or fading.The fit is exactly as expected. I followed the sizing guide, and they fit snugly without being too tight or restrictive, offering good support throughout the day. The comfort level is definitely a highlight. Whether I'm at work, running errands, or exercising, I've found them to be comfortable under various types of clothing. The waistband is particularly noteworthy; it's soft against the skin and doesn't roll or pinch, which is a common issue I've had with other brands.In terms of design, they're classic and straightforward - no unnecessary frills or gimmicks, just quality briefs that do their job well. The white color makes them versatile under lighter-colored pants or shorts, which is a plus.Overall, I'm quite pleased with these briefs. They deliver on comfort, fit, and quality, making them a reliable choice for anyone looking to refresh their underwear drawer. If you're in the market for no-nonsense, comfortable underwear that fits as expected, these white briefs are definitely worth considering.",5
B004QO7MG6,"Great price, fast delivery",5
B004QO7MG6,Bueno,4
B004QO7MG6,"Too small ordered 32-34. I am a 32"" waist and it did not fit.",3
B004QO7MG6,As descriped,3
B004QO7MG6,As expected,5
B004QO7MG6,My Husband is very happy,5
B004QO7MG6,These fit good but fabric is little less thick than in the past.,4
B004QO7MG6,"The online pic is not what this product looks like delivered I was hopig for a bit more updated framed style, however quality material and gets the job done for price and convenience.",4
B004QO7MG6,great fit.,5
B004QO7MG6,"Can't go wrong with Hanes tighty-whities - quality and fit are excellent as always. Delivery, for the most part, was efficient and uneventful. The only odd thing was the lack of packaging. It has been reported that Amazon is trying to cut down on wasteful packaging, so I expected a Tyvek envelope instead of just a shipping label stuck on the manufacturer's plastic wrap. There were no rips or tears in the package so, I assumed there was no product contamination. Therefore, the packaging was OK but just surprising.",5
B004QO7MG6,great,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"I am a bartender and am on my feet for 8 hours a night, five nights a week. Every other type of active sock I purchased have fallen apart or become hard on the feet within a few months. Wernies literally are soft, and comfortable, while strong enough to help keep my feet from hurting from all the time on my feet. Better yet they hold up over time and still feel as comfortable as they did the day I bought them. Never thought socks could make such a huge difference but Wernies has shown me they can. Love these socks!!!!",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Got two sets of these and they are cheap and of a good quality.  they do not stretch out in the wash , cushions your feet well and are slip resistant.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"I ordered the pack of dark blue, light blue, black and gray marled ankle socks. I'm a petite woman who wears size 6.5 shoes. Ordering the largest size available, for men no less, the socks were still too short in length. I can't imagine a man with size 9-11 shoes being comfortable in these size-wise. I love the socks in every other way; they are thick and cushioning, soft, and the extra touches like arch support and silicone stripes inside the heel cup really do work. If they weren't pulling on the tips of my toes, they'd be a perfect 5 stars. It could be that because these are made in China, potentially for their countrymen, they're using Asian sizing, which is traditionally smaller than US sizes. And no, the Chinese people didn't purposely make the socks too small to hurt our toes, and they aren't out to get us through commerce both of our countries benefit from. They are hard working, incredibly skilled people. They make amazing products for brands like Le Creuset and Gucci, but those companies pay for them accordingly. The companies you buy from set a budget, and the factory creates the best they can with it. The companies are supposed to control quality and pay enough for a product so it can be made suitably. The Chinese factories are simply meeting the companies' demands - they aren't to blame for subpar merchandise. The companies don't provide us with quality products because they get away with it. Raise your hand if you stopped eating at Burger King because the product doesn't match the picture. Hands? Anyone? Hands if you no longer buy $10 toasters that break after two uses? Anyone? Right. We want stuff, a lot of it, and cheap. Companies know they can sell you overpriced garbage, and politicians want you to think it's the fault of the mean old Chinese people, because blaming someone else for our problems is the first chapter in their playbook. Corporations and politicians aren't entirely to blame though - they merely lead the charge. Le Creuset products made in FRANCE are easily five times more expensive than their budget-friendly lines made in China. Why? Because we're racists who think Europeans are always superior. Sorry, but this needs to be said. Think about it, and buy these if you want excellent quality, small socks made by your fellow human beings. :)",3
B07Y4YTLDH,Perfect size and ankle height. Comfortable and colorful.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"I love these socks, I'm a size 11 shoe and these fit great. There is a small patch of rubber on the inside at the achilles to hold them up. My big problem with no show socks is that I always wind up walking out of them and wind up with them bunched up in my shoe. These socks solve that problem with that little patch, they are awesome.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"This review is for the lowest of these sock options. They are very low on the top of the foot, great for low slip on shoes and loafers. Good rubber grip on the back. The right thickness for my wide feet (meaning,they are on the thinner side which I need).  While great for low cut shoes, I find them just a bit too low for traditional sneakers. Because while I still want a no show for sneakers, these allow for direct skin to sneaker rubbing discomfort. For sneakers I LOVE their other no-show 'mid' sock. I have both shapes. Buy em both for different sneaker cuts.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Fits great and very comfortable. However, the fabric is thin and tears easily after about a month or so. Good for easy use. Not great for heavier duty use.",4
B07Y4YTLDH,"I wear size 10 1/2 shoes, I bout the 6-10 socks, probably should have bought the 11-13. they fir a little snug, but they are comfortable and fill my need.",4
B07Y4YTLDH,"these socks absorb the smell and sweat of my feet in a strong manner.  when washed, they are as if I just bought them and put them to use.",4
B07Y4YTLDH,I bought them for my husband who loves them too! I accidentally grabbed a pair & half way through my day realized that my socks hadn't bothered me all day. The size is larger than what I would normally wear but they don't slip off my heel and they have lots of toe room. I just bought another set for me!,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Very thin. Decent for my daughter.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,I have two grandsons that steal my socks frequently and they love my no-shows. So I order these quarterly and they are fantastic.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Very comfortable, lightweight socks.  The material is lightweight and does not strain to fit.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,First socks that dont roll down by ancle,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Buen producto... recomiendo su compra!!!,5
B07Y4YTLDH,one pair missing write on box one short,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Not heavy or thin.  Good for the price. Comfortable.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,"Received two different packages, same shipment box though. In any case, noticed a considerable size difference in the solid color vs the multi color socks. Slipped a pair of each on and as expected they rise differently. Both pair seem to fit fine. Wearability of these socks is still under consideration. Hoping they live up to the hype reviews.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"eso, yo soy 9 y quedaron muy ajustados, compre la talla M 6-10",4
B07Y4YTLDH,"I'd really like to rate these 3.5, but I'm in a generous mood so rounded up to 4.Overall, the socks do what they're supposed to do -- they're no show socks, and I like the colors, particularly the blue, which is not something you see a lot.Two big complaints though.  They are just really, really thin.  To the point that shoes that fit well with regular dress socks are too loose when I wear these socks.  These socks are more of a replacement for wearing no socks at all, I think.  The socks are a bit of a slippery material as well.The other complaint is that they run small.  My foot size goes between 10.5 and 11, wide.  I got the size 11-13 socks, and they are a bit snug.  I couldn't imagine how well these socks would work if you were a size 13.Probably the best thing about the socks is that you get a lot of them, and they're reasonable cost.  And as noted above, I like the colors.  But overall, I guess I was expecting a bit more.",4
B07Y4YTLDH,My husband loves these socks. He highly recommends them.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"I've owned so many brands of no show socks. These are strong, comfortable, and most importantly stay secured to your heel. They've got some little rubber strips inside the back of the heel area. Genius.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,Fit me well with little showing. Recently purchased so don't know about longevity yet.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Just as described,5
B07Y4YTLDH,My husband loves these! He had been buying a pricier version of these only to be disappointed. These stay put like they say.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,great they fit his over sized feet quite well,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Sooo good  comfy relaxing and truly no show,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"I like the comfort of these socks, and they fit well. Now maybe it is me, but I didn't see them saying how many pair you got but it is 8 pair. 3 grey, 3 black and 2 white or at least that is what I got. I would say they are worth getting.",4
B07Y4YTLDH,Great socks!,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Great fit,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Muy buenas y la cantidad por el precio excelente,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Muy comodas, se adaptan muy bien al pie.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Good price, good quality!",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Great product that I would buy again but unfortunately the Amazon courier, Ninja Van (here in the Philippines), is not reliable (did not deliver to the door, just left the package at the gate of the sub division without ensuring my receipt) - upon asking why, the courier advised they were running out of fuel !!!!!",4
B07Y4YTLDH,Good fit.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Very comfortable.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,thin but they do the job,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Wore these all day long.  Never slipped in my shoes.  Barely tell they are there.  Haven't slipped off of my feet yet.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Will buy again very comfortable socks!,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Size was perfect,5
B07Y4YTLDH,UTILES MUY BUENAS,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Great,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Good quality,5
B07Y4YTLDH,These socks are decent quality but they are definitely not no-show style. Even wearing sneakers you can see these socks much less in loafers and boat shoes. They do stay on your feet well and provide enough thickness for comfort. I will likely wear these when golfing to keep my shoes from rubbing my heels.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,The socks were not what I thought by the picture and description but I can still use them come summer time. Definitely not a winter sock.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,no shrinkage,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"My husband hates no show socks because they never fit right and constantly slide under the heel. However,  these fit his size 13 feet and stay in place while walking.  He said they are very comfortable to wear. They did not shrink in the wash even after going through the dryer.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"I like the feel, fit, and comfortability",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"No le tenia fe , pero buen material y ajuste perfecto",5
B07Y4YTLDH,Very thin....good for summer only,4
B07Y4YTLDH,"I bought these socks because I like the not having socks on look and where I live in California it's usually very hot so the low cut socks are very nice to have. This particular brand is really nice, they came in a small box and they are tightly rolled and they fit snug to your foot  I bought all black socks. My favorite color. They fit perfectly in my shoes as advertised and they are very thin and breathable. I am very satisfied with this brand and I will return to buy them again!",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"If these were pure cotton,  I  would have given 5 stars. The spandex in the Sox make my feet feel a little sweaty. Otherwise,  they are really great.  The fit is excellent and they actually provide some support when I  wear boat shoes,  which often otherwise feel too loose.  They are small,  so I wash them in a mesh laundry bag so I can find them all in the finished laundry.  I will by them again  when these wear out.",4
B07Y4YTLDH,The socks fit my feel well.  I purchased some more because I want to wear them everyday.  I even wear them to bed to keep my feet warm.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,The sick are no show. The silicon in heel help them stay in place. The downside is they run small. The size reads 11-13. I wear a size 10.5 and these are just a little too short to be comfortable.,3
B07Y4YTLDH,Little angle socks are a good price and almost fit like little compression socks for big feet.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Comfortable fit  washes well and keeps shape  very nice product will order again,5
B07Y4YTLDH,The fit was perfect. They washed very nice. I was perfectly happy with them.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Best socks yet,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Excellent product. Totally comfortable. Excellent supplier compliance,5
B07Y4YTLDH,I really like the grip lines on the heel to prevent them from slipping down into your shoe. I also like that they're super thin and work with shoes that won't accommodate a thick stock. My low-top Chucks are a perfect example.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,My Grandson said he liked them,5
B07Y4YTLDH,I bought these for my brother in law. He loves these socks.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Super  soft! I ABSOLUTELY  LOVE THEM!,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"These ""no show"" socks from Wernies are simply the best out there. I've tried many, and nothing even comes close to these.As soon as you put these on the difference is so apparent. The variety of weaves in the sock make them fit perfectly, and will provide outstanding support to your feet. They also won't fall down inside your shoes, because they put clear silicone strips in the inside of the sock, at the heel.The color selection is very good, and they keep the original color even after numerous machine washings.I'm telling you the honest fact that these are super socks, and a great bargain. Your feet will thank you.",5
B07Y4YTLDH,"the info in the ad is wrong. these are not men's socks, unless he's under 5"" tall. i'm a size 6 & they fit me. most men don't wear size 6. these are women's socks, for small feet, or boys socks. my mom wears a 9 & can't fit these!! so yeah- info is very, very wrong!!! they're nice socks, but not for the average man, by any stretch of the imagination.",3
B07Y4YTLDH,La relacion precio cantidad es bastante buena,4
B07Y4YTLDH,"The product is good for the intented purpose, but the material has to much elastic, to where it caused my toes to be squeezed together, to which it became uncomfortable and begun to hurt.  Therefore, I discarded the product.",3
B07Y4YTLDH,Really like the little rubber pieces in the heel of these socks. As long as you use tie on shoes these things work fine. As with any short sock like this if your shoes aren't pretty tight they will fall off the back of your heel the rubber seems to help on the inside of the sock. Seem to hold up pretty well though they are pretty thin but I like thin socks. Would definitely purchase them again.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Very comfortable sock for men or women. I love them.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Good price,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Good value for 8 pair. Color and style as pictured.  Fit good and snug.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Christmas stocking gift for my son.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,"Well made, good value",5
B07Y4YTLDH,Very nice,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Soft socks but too thin for my liking.,4
B07Y4YTLDH,Small socks that stay up,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Good for around the house. Would be good for size 8 or less,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Very comfortable & stylish no-show socks. Use them everyday with my trainers for going to work. Nice product.,5
B07Y4YTLDH,Nice soft fabric. Son loves them,5
B07Y4YTLDH,No show below the ankle socks great for the gym or just casual wear.  Good value.,5
B074XY7MTG,"Shirts are decent quality, fit well, and are comfortable. But they off-gassed as soon as I opened the package. The off-gassing was worse than a packed foam mattress. It's a very strong chemical smell. The odor made my wife and I nauseous, and transferred to things it touches. I can't even imagine what in the manufacturing process would contain, which would instill such a strong chemical odor. These shirts were manufactured in the DR if that's at all indicative of our experience.",1
B074XY7MTG,"My 14 year old son is super picky about the undershirts he wears for baseball. He will only wear these shirts because they are lightweight, cool and just the right fit (not too snug, not too loose). I have tried a ridiculous variation of undershirts and these are by far the best. They do shrink a little after drying for the first time, but they keep their shape otherwise (I never air dry). This specific blend of rayon and polyester is hard to find. It's this blend that makes these shirts stand out from the rest. I couldn't be happier with the quality and pricing of these undershirts!",5
B074XY7MTG,"I bought these for my son who is in Marching Band. We live in Arizona and have very warm Summers. These shirts are very lightweight, soft, and comfortable. The only comment from the 13 year old was they are a bit see through.",5
B074XY7MTG,"I like to wear a undershirt under polos nd other open collared shirts, so you can always see my undershirt neck line.  I bought these, and at first was happy with how thin they are.  Unfortunately after just one or two uses, these shirts are no longer wearable.  The neck gets loose and stretched, nd doesn't improve with washing, but that's not the worst part.  the material is so soft and fragile that after just one or two days of wear, the neck gets completely pilled ad fuzzy.  It looks really shabby.  I attribute this to my chin/neck stubble , but still- it should last longer than one or two wearings.  Within a week I have now thrown them all out.",1
B074XY7MTG,Fit great. Soft. Cool. Fabric is a little thinner than I expected but it is breathable.,4
B074XY7MTG,The right length and fit.,5
B074XY7MTG,"I wish I took a picture of how these t-shirts came.  They were out of the inner packaging, there was supposed to be five shirts and only three were in there.  One was dirty like someone had taken two out of the packaging before it was shipped.  Very disappointed because Hanes is a good brand.  I do a lot of shopping through Amazon, so this was very upsetting to me.",1
B074XY7MTG,"Holy crap these shirts ""new""  out of the box they smell so bad the smell is so unbearable. I was literally gagging the entire time unwrapping the packaging and all the way directly to my washing machine. I'm keeping them because they do feel nice and I'm hoping whatever the godly hell was on the shirts that made them stink so bad He's going to be cleaned off in the washing machine. But That is the only reason I'm giving this one star for this reason alone holy crap your shirt should not smell as bad out of the box. I understand shirts are not 100% clean when you first get them and you should wash your clothes before you wear them but I have never experienced a smell this horrid on new clothes before.",1
B074XY7MTG,"This is our second purchase. Worn 3 1/2 school years every day (sometimes weekends too) under military uniform. If you follow washing instructions they hold up very well. Still ok to wear, just wanted newer whiter ones. Long enough to tuck in, fabric is soft, no tags. Dry quicker than reg cotton under wool blend uniforms.",5
B074XY7MTG,"I should have assumed for the price but had to try it. Shirts arrived on time and fit well. The fabric is see through and extremely thin, I have no faith that they will last more than a few washes. So cheaply made, that I am considering not wearing them even as an undershirt. Do not buy if you are using in a professional wardrobe or setting.",1
B074XY7MTG,"Comfy and does a good job wicking, but it's cheaply made and too thin to wear out on it's own. Cheap enough that I may buy more if I don't find anything better by the time these fall apart.",3
B074XY7MTG,"Wow, these are terrible! They are SO thin, they are practically see-through. My son needs them for an outfit asap, otherwise I would definitely be returning these. They also do have a terrible smell that I'm hoping washes out enough for him to wear them more than just one day.",1
B074XY7MTG,"It is extremely hot & humid were we live among the cane fields, swamps, bayous in the land of mesquite of bait South Louisiana. The cooler the clothes the better so I was pleased to find these light weight undershirts.My 5'3 115lb 10 yr old son requested this type of under shirt for under his school uniforms this year. He seems to be happy, swears his shirt is ""lighter & not so sweaty"" Me- a mom, no too happy about all the fuzzball on the shirt after the 1st wash. Maybe I got a bad pack, I dont know. But what I do know, fuzzball, fuzzball, fuzzball.I posted a picture, but I am not a professional fuzzball photographer.",4
B074XY7MTG,"Holy cow they smell so bad. Either a bad chemical odor or like the've been a musty basement for 10 years. Oofta cannot wear them without washing first.Also they are super thin/see through, but that is why i bought them. (undershirt for work in hot environment)",2
B074XY7MTG,"Bought these to replace my old undershirts and interestingly, these feel exactly like them.Generic Hanes' cotton undershirts are usually rough and need a few laundry-cycles to break-in (smooth/nice feel), but not these. These come as nice and soft already. I agreed with others that the undershirts are a little bit.... flimsy and transparent. They are definitely not suitable for public wear (except if you're planning to show off your body....).Don't be fooled by the words ""X-Temp"" or ""Cool"", these are more or less feels like a smoother/nicer Hanes' cotton undershirt.",4
B074XY7MTG,I wear them every day. Good shirt. No issues,5
B074XY7MTG,Lo uso debajo del uniforme de trabajo y me es favorable,4
B074XY7MTG,excelente calidad,5
B074XY7MTG,"My husband has been wearing Hanes T-shirts for decades - always reliable, durable & comfortable. His current batch perhaps 5 years old - had gotten thin & flimsy from so many washes, so I ordered a new batch for him. Ugh! They are, fresh out of the package, just as thin and flimsy as the used ones!  I'd noticed this with women's cotton knit shirts for a few years now, but didn't expect Hanes to pull such a shabby trick. He says they ""feel okay"" and he's wearing them, but I'll be surprised if the last through the end of the year.",2
B074XY7MTG,"I love the product, white Ts are super comfortable for me to wear underneath shirts or alone. I like them for night wear. Light weight and dry wick helps a ton",4
B074XY7MTG,Perfect fit and very comfortable..I'll be buying more,5
B074XY7MTG,These are very light abs thin! My husband likes them but wondering how long they will hold up,4
B074XY7MTG,"These shirts are a bit ridiculous. The material is so thin that you can see through it completely as if you were in the final rounds of a wet t-shirt contest. They are a tight fit but honestly, with an undershirt, there are only 2 purposes. Soak up sweat and show off the collar as another layer underneath. The collar is fine so 3 stars.",3
B074XY7MTG,he wears a white T-shirt almost every day. Ever since we found these he now wears them. they were SUPER soft when I opened them I was surprised. Even after a few washes they are still soft!,5
B074XY7MTG,"These are good undershirts. Whether there was a screwup at the packaging facility or somewhere along the way, however, I only received 4 of these t-shirts, not 5.",3
B074XY7MTG,"If you live in hot weather and need shirts that will keep you cool. GET THESE. They're thin, sure. But they're thin with purpose. Thats the point! They don't fair well in the wrinkle department but I didn't care cause I wear them as under shirts.",5
B074XY7MTG,I wear these under all my winter shirts and also in the summer. Love the fabric,5
B074XY7MTG,"Working retail in South Texas, I needed thinner shirts to wear under a dress shirt. These are thin enough to wear comfortably and I prefer them to the regular white shirts.",5
B074XY7MTG,Shrank in the wash.,3
B074XY7MTG,"Noticeable difference in preventing sweaty armpits in my white dress shirts I put over, for my service job.",5
B074XY7MTG,I just received a package of the small X-Temp comfort shirts and pretty disappointed. Three of the five shirts have threading defects around the collar area. I expected better quality buying from Hanes Amazon store verses getting them from a place known to have defected products.,3
B074XY7MTG,"I'm sitting here asking him the questions because they were bought for him. He says they're comfortable, and the fit is fine. He doesn't like reviewing clothes.",5
B074XY7MTG,shirts are comfortable but very thin and see through,4
B074XY7MTG,I was expecting the thicker X-temp shirt I had bought before. These are the thinnest undershirts I have ever seen. I price is high for such thin fabric.They are comfortable and fit well. If you want a thin shirt you will be happy. If you want a thick one you will be disappointed.,3
B074XY7MTG,Great,4
B074XY7MTG,"I bought several sets - gave some as gifts.  I love these (wearing one now) for their comfort, softness, retention of shape.  Highly recommended.",5
B074XY7MTG,My husband is very tall and thin. He was worried the smalls would be too short but they are a perfect fit. He is very happy and even had me feel how soft it was when he tried one on. He is very happy with these.,5
B074XY7MTG,My son uses these as sleep and lounge shirts. They are super soft and comfy. They are long enough to tuck in if desired.,5
B074XY7MTG,These are very thin and cheap. All of them have holes after a few uses. They never look clean. After 4-5 uses they look worse than any of my other shirts.  For a similar price I got the 32 degrees brand white t shirts and they are way better (Costco has them and they go on sale often on the 32 degrees website). Don't waste your money on something designed to be disposable.,2
B074XY7MTG,Delivery time very poor!,4
B074XY7MTG,These t-shirts are nice and light perfect for summer. Tagless,4
B074XY7MTG,These are the ones I'm going to reorder.  I don't know how I wore cotton undershirts all these years.  The moisture wicking materials make these shirts perfect for warm days.,5
B074XY7MTG,"this shirt was completely see through, maybe that's why it is suppose to be cooler than a regular undershirt.  Which is not what I was looking for.",3
B074XY7MTG,i bought these for my boyfriend and i wasn't sure about the size but the fit him perfectly,5
B074XY7MTG,I work in hot environments I absolutely love these shirts they are comfortable cool and soo soft. Highly recommend,5
B074XY7MTG,i use the t-shirt for work and i really like it because it's soft and comfortable,5
B074XY7MTG,These t shirts are made of thin materials. I live in south Florida this is perfect for me,5
B074XY7MTG,Fit as expected. True moisture wicking. Purchased for teenage boys who play sports.,5
B074XY7MTG,I purchased these for mu hubby; he said they are the softest undershirts he has ever worn A+,5
B074XY7MTG,"These shirts are very, very thin...like what's the point in having a shirt on thin.  They are also do not fit true to size for comparable brands  They are loose and unfitted which isn't a good quality for an undershirt.  Finally, the quality is poor at best.  Straight out of the package these shirts had tons of loose threads sticking out of all the seams.",2
B074XY7MTG,Great value pack and cool feel. I ordered a small and I'm 5'6 132 lbs and it fits great,5
B074XY7MTG,"This is a nice, soft t-shirt. Great fit and comfortable!",5
B074XY7MTG,This shirts are good quality,5
B074XY7MTG,Classic undershirt. Soft. Lightweight. Fits great. Not skin tight or baggy,5
B074XY7MTG,So comfortable. Would live in these tees all the time if I could.,5
B074XY7MTG,"Thin material, but fine for undershirts.",4
B074XY7MTG,"Good shirts, they fit close to body...",5
B074XY7MTG,Durable under my uniform.,5
B074XY7MTG,Holding up well after two months.,5
B074XY7MTG,Softest t-shirts I've bought.  My son loves them.,5
B074XY7MTG,"These are good shirts, very thin and breathable.  Extremely effective underlayer.",5
B074XY7MTG,These look great out of the package but they quickly self destruct after a few months of normal wash and wear use. I won't buy them again. :(,2
B074XY7MTG,Comfortable and great for the summer,5
B074XY7MTG,liked the fit,5
B074XY7MTG,"nice shirts, just don't like being shorted.",3
B074XY7MTG,"Comfortable,and good quality",5
B074XY7MTG,Fits as expected!,5
B074XY7MTG,Price,5
B074XY7MTG,Very soft and comfortable. Has a luxurious feel .,5
B074XY7MTG,Great tees in a smaller size,5
B074XY7MTG,"Yikes - the other reviews are spot on. Super thin, see-through material. Also, not a slim fit - pretty baggy. Definite thumbs down in these.",2
B074XY7MTG,"These are not the same Hanes x-temp shirts you bought before. They are now made with rayon instead of cotton and are so paper thin that you may as well drape yourself in tulle, so forget about shedding a layer when you get hot. The fit is now much more loose, which is exactly what I don't want in an undershirt. Would not recommend.",1
B074XY7MTG,These are extremely thin shirts,3
B074XY7MTG,N/a,5
B074XY7MTG,good fit,5
B074XY7MTG,Liked it,5
B074XY7MTG,"Same as my other review. It's super thin, but great for labor work.",2
B074XY7MTG,Received 4 shirts in the size that I ordered which was S and 1 in L,2
B074XY7MTG,Worst undershirt I've ever worn. Too short to stay tucked in. (And I'm short.) Material is VERY thin. Construction is adequate but nothing special. Would NEVER order again.,2
B074XY7MTG,Nice shirts for the price. Fit well but way too see through and thin. Ended up having to return.,2
B074XY7MTG,PERFECT,5
B074XY7MTG,The sizing is ok but the material is very thin..  than I expected,2
B074XY7MTG,I bought them for my son. But he doesn't wear them because there see threw. And they shrink bad when washed,1
B074XY7MTG,These were the most comfortable and soft undershirts until you start washing them.  They have shrank so much.  Get a size larger.,2
B074XY7MTG,Good production,5
B074XY7MTG,"These are more elastic, like underarmor kind of or other workout shirts. I am a big fan of the x-temp shirts, I was excited when i saw this listing but they are not at all the same. They are slick, stretchy and not at all soft.",1
B074XY7MTG,Works really well. Really glad w the purchase,5
B074XY7MTG,Extremely soft and comfortable,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"In my household, we spend a LOT of time in a volleyball gym. My wife coaches and I sometimes assist and my 3 daughters all play very high level. If you spend anytime in a volleyball gym, at night, in the winter, you know that you might as well be playing outside. Same goes for tournament venues on those super nice Saturday pre-dawn mornings in the low desert. Long story short, I was sick and tired of freezing every time I attended a tournament, so I bought these PURE CHAMP jogger sweatpants and boy am I glad I did.Fist of all, they are warm. Like if the temps exceed 72, be ready to sweat. (Full Star)Second, they are comfortable. Soft and dare I say plush. I also really enjoy the zippered pockets to help secure small items like Air Pods. (2 stars)Third, they are well made. The seams are string, and the previously mentioned zippers are solid, I have no doubt these will last long enough to be worth their cost. (2 stars)LASTLY!!!!!  WATCH THE SIZING. In pants like this, I normally wear a large (36 waist, 32 inseam) and T, without looking at the sizing chart, ordered a set in ""my"" size. They fit great upon arrival, even after the first few washes if I tumble dried or air dried them. After 1 heated dry cycle....the pants are...more form fitting than desired. Yes, they have a high cotton content, yes it was my error, but they feel as if they have shrunk a full size and a half to two sizes.Anyways, I recommend sizing up from your norm and dry away. For this, I was going to deduct a star, but it was my ignorance that caused the pants to shrink and my inpatients that prevented me from reviewing the manufacturers sizing chart, so the product itself still gets all the stars.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,I've purchased multiple packs of these pants 12 pairs of pants in total and I wear them daily as day and night cloths I have bad cold urticaria so I need to always wear warm clothing I've had them for about a year now and every pair is still going strong I purchased these because of the zipper pockets and I love them I don't have to worry about my phone or anything else falling out of my pockets anymore and none of them have broke after daily/nightly use the pockets are decently sized they're not super deep but they seem bigger then average pockets the material is soft and comfortable and you can't really feel the zippers even if you're sleeping in them but some of the pairs I wear more often aren't as soft anymore and the pants does have pills/lint balls on them but it doesn't bother me but I know that could be a problem for others the pants are warm but not to hot I wouldn't recommend wearing them in extreme cold or heat as I still get rashes when it's really cold and I'm outside for a while and you will get hot if you wear them outside in the summer for long periods of time the sizes of the pants are mostly accurate some of them seem to be a little bit more snug while others are a tad bit looser the colors are great but the navy blue a recived is a little dull and looks a little grey sometimes but overall I love these pants and I would definitely purchase more in the future!,5
B09ZCDYPR6,They seem to be a good quality product. I have not wore them for an extended period of time since I had to send them back because they were too short. I am 6 foot two 205 pounds and they were extremely tight in the thighs and were about 4 inches too shortthey ended up having the lower cuff just below my calf and I have a 34 inch inseam. I am returning them for an extra large pair because I do like the quality.  They ended up having the lower cuff just below my calf and I have a 34 inch inseam. I am returning them for a extra large pair because I do like the quality.,3
B09ZCDYPR6,These are thick and slim fitting or snug athletic style but big pockets with zippers and very comfy and they look amazing on my husband. He really likes them !,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"These are Great pants. So comfortable, soft like a new sweatshirt. Snug elastic on top and bottom so they stay in place. My only issue is they're a little small, or more likely, I'm a lot fat.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,I love the quality and comfort my only negative for me is they are a bit short,4
B09ZCDYPR6,"I'm 155lb and 5'11"" and they're a good couple of inches shorter than I'd normally like.  Otherwise, they're nice!",4
B09ZCDYPR6,"My husband has thick thighs from leg day and squats. So many times pants fit snuggly on the thighs and wear thin or pull at the crotch seams. These don't! They work great with athletic thighs! The zippers are durable and hold wallets and cell phones securely. It's long enough for someone over 5'10"". They are decently thick for cooler weather.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,"Great pants, soft, warm, and comfortable. These pants are truly remarkable, crafted from a luxuriously soft fabric that feels delightful against your skin. They envelop you in warmth, making them an ideal choice for chilly weather. The comfortable fit is designed to allow for unrestricted movement, whether you're relaxing at home, enjoying a casual outing, or engaging in light activities.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,He said they are comfortable but they are thin so he had to wear thermals under them I thought they would have been thicker but they get for him to wear to work,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Cheap and comfortable.  I wear these everywhere they last and are comfy.  About $10 a pair. you can't beat that.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Fits as expected. There was a delay in shipping but I don't think it was the seller's fault. Super comfortable material and the fit is good for those with large legs. Been wearing them on my leg days and they hold up well.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"bought these for my husband at Christmas.  He absolutely loves them.  He says they're very comfortable, fit well and he really likes the pockets.  Great buy!",5
B09ZCDYPR6,Bought for my senior dad who likes comfy pants but has a short inseam. He likes the pockets too.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,"Those sweatpants are good enough, but if you wear pant 29 or 30 waist, then the waist of these pants loose ,a little too big for small size.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,Fit well pockets are great but zippers broke on all 3 pairs.Soft and a Lil stretch to them.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,"They fit and feel nice, but my only problem is the black pants are pilling after 2 washes. I ended up throwing the black pair away bz they look terrible.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,Buy 1 size up.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,These sweatpants fabric pills easily,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Thermal underwear is simply not enough when temps dip below 30 degrees! That's why I wear this fleece lined athletic workout sweatpant over my thermal underwear bottom! ADD winter slacks and you have warmth well at hand!,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I liked the decent price.T NIGHT I Had PLanned to wear them to keep warm in bed,",4
B09ZCDYPR6,"Overall I really enjoy these joggers. I think they fit nicely, I like the zipper pockets, comfortable and quite warm (sometimes too warm working around the house.). However one pair did develop a small hole along a seem that was a little disappointing.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,These are awesome! Tried several other brands. Items would fall outta pockets or material would just be off. These are close to perfect as gonna get... especially for price,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"These are some of the best sweats I've ever owned, the fit is perfect and I really like the zipper pockets. I would recommend them to anyone.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,"Good quality and thickness, my son loves the zipper pockets. The drawstring is a little long, but only possible complaint.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,Nike tech? Oh my these are tuff,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I gave it 4 start and it's probably my fault but for the last 2 weeks or so I'm been buying joggers and sweatpants and sending them back just can't find that right fit do to my body shape but these sweatpants is kinda working out for me some what wish the pockets were a little deeper. In this drawstring,was a little longer, but other than that, they are some good sweatpants had to send them back and go up a size by them being fleece sweatpants, they fit tight to you.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,"Despite the fact that the copy says zippered pockets, not all color sets have zippered pockets.  I picked the color set I wanted and presumed that the zippers were offset inside the pocket as they were not visible in the photos.  I received the color set I wanted BUT they do not have zippered pockets.  They do however have pockets on the legs.  I have now decided that some of the color sets have zippered pockets (and same are visible on the pics for that set) and other color sets have pockets on the legs (also visible on the pics for that set).  So apparently if zippered pockets are a must have, you have to pick a color set that has pics showing a visible zipper.  The pocket issue wasn't important enough to me to do a return but I thought it might be a deal breaker for some.  They are comfortable and look good.  Absent the inaccurate copy, I would have given them 5 stars.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,I was looking for something comfortable but that looked nice. These were great. They are not your typical sweatpants either and my man loved the pockets. He can not stop talking about them. Do not hesitate to get them! (worth the price too),5
B09ZCDYPR6,Well made.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Delivered on time. Product is as described.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"They are soft, comfortable, and fits perfectly. I never thought I would see him in sweatpants, but he loves these. I bought some for myself too!!",5
B09ZCDYPR6,They're nice a little tight but still comfortable.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,I took a chance and ordered these for my 24 year old son and he loves them! They are perfect for winter and they have zipper pockets! They look nice too,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Look good and fit well and comfortable everything you need in pants,5
B09ZCDYPR6,I have ordered 3 sets of these. They are great.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Muy buena calidad y comodos,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I have tried quite a few brands and finally settled on PURE CHAMP sweatpants. They are very comfortable. Fits nice and true to size. Zipper side pockets are useful to keep things from falling out. Also has a good size back pocket, which very few brands offer. Happy with the purchase.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,Muy buenos,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Being tall or have long legs makes it difficult to buy pants of any sort that are just a little shorter in length. BUT these are great in every way.Now I 'm very upset that they are no longer available. Difficult because should've bought more but most of the time I end up giving away new pants because of the shorter length. Buh.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,What a great product.  Very comfortable. Great quality.  All around a great deal,5
B09ZCDYPR6,They feel very warm,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Son-in-law love them even though they came in very late.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Theses are really could sweat pants but just really fragile zippers on the pockets. Even if they break the pockets are still fine. It's live withable,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Husband loves the pants their soft and I just wish they made bigger sizes for myself,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"Quality Fabric, Well made.Waistband is  Strechy and Thick.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,Prompt delivery product is exactly as described,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"These sweats are very soft on the inside and fit very well, and I also like the zipper pockets because I have had many scares in the past sitting down and dropping my wallet. I did notice a pretty strong smell the first time wearing these, but after I washed them the smell went away.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,"My husband loves them, they are very comfortable, you can definitely wear these anywhere, they are not big and baggy, they are very stylish",5
B09ZCDYPR6,Great for Fall and Winter.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Comfy and just what I needed to get dressed easily after a hip replacement.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I recently bought these sweats and they are extremely comfortable. The only issue I have is the size recommendation. Whatever the size recommendation is, go a size down as the waist is really flexible and the thigh/quad are is a tad baggy. A medium would have been a much better fit instead of the recommended large.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,great with the zippers,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I love how comfortable these are, but after washing one for the very first time, the center seam right up the middle just fell apart. As in, more than a foot long hole in the pants from the crotch to the back elastic of the waist band. The other two in this three pack came out just fine.... For now",3
B09ZCDYPR6,Grandson loves the softness of these.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,He was pleasantly surprised that his Nana ordered these joggers for him!! He said they are really soft and the quality is great. He said he is going to order more himself,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Grandson loves them,5
B09ZCDYPR6,Just had an arm injury so bought these for easy on with one hand. Like the feel and really like the zipper pockets. Just wish they had a shorter inseam..,4
B09ZCDYPR6,For the money these have been great. Super comfortable and hold up to washing after 1 year. Well done.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I bought them a long time ago and they are quite comfortable and durable, if they came with problems in my pockets. One was unstitched and the other with a small hole",4
B09ZCDYPR6,"Fits really well, tie strings are good, only one issue I've had is some of the sew on the part that holds your waist string in place came undone on one side, no big issue in my personal opinion.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,Very nice,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"These joggers are incredibly comfortable! The fleece material is soft against the skin, making them perfect for lounging or workouts. The fit is true to size, accommodating a range of body types. I appreciate the elastic waistband with a drawstring, allowing for a customizable fit that stays in place during physical activities.",4
B09ZCDYPR6,Ordered for my husband but was too small. I ended up giving to another family member.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Ordeexred an extra large..these must.be China XL.. should've ordered XXL.. I am 6'2. 210.. they fit fine new but one wash and they will be too small.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Looks to be great quality.Wish the order would come in a bag u can't see through.  Sometimes they are gifts.,4
B09ZCDYPR6,The only complaint is one pair was slightly torn in the middle but for 6 of them and how comfortable they are im not too upset,4
B09ZCDYPR6,It was hard enough trying to find the right sweatpants for my son in the store. I am glad I bought these! Will be reordering very soon.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"I will start with I really do like these. The material is great, and the fit is perfect. I would love to give these five stars. However, I have only worn two of the three pairs, and only once each on the two that I have worn. Both of those pairs the zippers broke just by me putting my hands in my pocket. So if you're concerned about the zippers, look elsewhere. If you don't care about the zippers, these are perfect.",3
B09ZCDYPR6,Very well constructed with high quality material. Wide elastic waistband and zippered pockets for useful wearability. One of the three seemed to be somewhat smaller in the waist,4
B09ZCDYPR6,Great value and husband loves the fit.,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"Wide waist ban, ties on outside not the inside, like it. Feels warm and comfortable. Compares to others that are much more expensive. Will buy again. Be sure to check the fit chart, I normally wear a large, but the chart says extra large, the chart is right.Don't buy the cargo style. The pocket is too low and velcro is cheap and doesn't work.  When I sit down my phone falls out.",5
B09ZCDYPR6,Fleecy  and true to size... Very comfortable. The zippered pockets are handy,5
B09ZCDYPR6,"Great styling and fit.  However, the label clearly states not to put them in the dryer.  I hung them up and they dried quickly.  No pulling.",4
B0BRK4SLFT,"Buy em, great value. I ordered this based off one of my favorite vendors underwear material. Same material at fraction of the cost, so light and breathable it fits well in skinny jeans, or if you just want to lounge you will be comfortable in any setting",5
B0BRK4SLFT,"I've been using the Hanes boxer briefs for years and as I've gotten older I've run into a problem. THOSE underwear are too tight in the waist and leg relative to the size, and the giant hard seams cut into things quite painfully when sitting down in a car or sleeping at night. So I've been looking for an alternative.Other underwear like this are so thin that they don't adequately absorb moisture from sweat and and so tight they can be uncomfortable. These...are neither.Bamboo is an underutilized clothing material. It's very soft after processing and incredibly strong. I've had bamboo bedsheets and they were the coolest, softest, best I've ever used bar none. These underwear are undoubtedly also the best I've ever used. Why the 4 stars then?While these underwear are wonderfully comfortable, don't have giant hard seams that dig into your skin and nether bits, and stay cool, they are also thin, almost inadequately so. They are also crazy expensive. They cost about TRIPLE what a package of Hanes will cost you.So, yes, they are good. VERY good. But the thickness needs to go up and the cost needs to come down. Somehow.Oh yeah, and they ride up. Everything does that's a boxer brief.",4
B0BRK4SLFT,"Cool and comfortable!  The elasticity is perfect.  They hold things in while not being constrictive; so, the support is fantastic.  These things are super lightweight, too.",5
B0BRK4SLFT,"Purchased for my husband for recovery after his vasectomy, they gave just the right amount of support and comfort! The quality is great, and they have quickly become his go-to boxers.",5
B0BRK4SLFT,Soft and comfy.  Just what I was looking for.,5
B0BRK4SLFT,"One pair started ripping the first day and it is a hassel to get credit or replacement. I would have to return all of them and it would take 2-3 weeks!  I like them, but won't order again!",3
B0BRK4SLFT,My husbands new favorite underwear- he was on LuLu Lemon underwear for a while but has said that he is now in love with these underwear and won't go back. He has tried these longer ones as well as the shorter ones and prefers these!,5
B0BRK4SLFT,"I love these briefs.  Super breathable and stretchy. I keep pointing to the quality of these for the price you pay.  Time will tell how long they last, but i love everything about them.  Also purchased for multiple family members and they enjoy them also.",5
B0BRK4SLFT,My husband absolutely love the comfort.. These are the only brand he wants.,5
B0BRK4SLFT,"These underwear are great, I can finally get rid of my whitie tities.",5
B0BRK4SLFT,Excellent quality!,5
B0BRK4SLFT,They are soft and comfortable but are small in fit.,4

B0BRK4SLFT,Comfortable material.,5
B0BRK4SLFT,"fit really well, Comfortable",5
B0BRK4SLFT,Comfortable,5
B0BRK4SLFT,"I like the fit and finish. i mainly got them for bicycling and i wear normal people shorts not that spandex that most bikers wear.i got them because after 10 year of heavy biking i finally realized it was my haines cotton brief seams in the crotch area where i sit that was killing me, so i wanted something thinner, and with less seam or no seam where i sit and these work out well.i was afraid they may be warmer than what i was used to and to my surprise they are much cooler.they are slippery to other garments, like the shorts i like to ride in, so i found my shorts were sliding down while riding, but i was able to tighten my shorts belt one notch and that seems to be working, but i dont like my shorts being that tight but i will deal with it.i dont like how they come down my legs a bit, maybe 4 or 5 inches, but i suspect this helps hold them in place. also they can get just a little bunched up here, but i am ok with dealing with it.they keep your twig and berries with just enough support and position to not get smashed around while biking.i suspect these cost just as much as my daily haines briefs, which i think is good as i would have paid a bit more since they have a specific application for me.",5
B0BRK4SLFT,These bad boy hug and give you the space needed to feel free.,5
B077ZN2F83,"I like the v neck shirts because most other shirts feel like they are too tight around my neck. 100 percent cotton are soft and comfortable fitting. I bought 2 XL because I don't like my shirts tight fitting. I haven't washed them yet but I'm sure they will shrink a tiny bit which I'm ok with. I measure my chest at 52"" and it feels a little big but like I said they probably will shrink after washing.These were a good price for a great connton shirt. Will most likely purchase again I like the Gildan brand of shirts,always a nice and comfortable fit for me.",5
B077ZN2F83,"the tshirts are soft and even it seem slim fabric the quality is very high, fit perfectly for the body and look great (remenber to pick the right size) and i use M size and is the same size i use no distorsion of size like other product doesnt show real size around the global market, i wash them a lot and still great and keep the color so i really recommended, and during hot days (22 to 24 celsius degrees where i live) is confortable and not itchy, for people who sweat a lot like me is a great product.",5

B077ZN2F83,This is just one of my best brand of undergarments. I enjoy the soft comfort that's lightweight and easy to clean. Size are perfect. True to size and easy to wear in any season. But just a little note after buying many sets. Sometimes the feature color is replaced with a grey shirt. Just be aware. Enjoy the shorts and shirts.,5
B077ZN2F83,Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. I would highly recommend them. Pretty true to size. 6 ft. 155 lbs man size XL fits loose but perfectly to allow a bit of shrinkage.,5
B077ZN2F83,These are way better than Hanes or Fruit of  whatever. Soft and comfortable fit. Just all around seem like they are better quality!,5
B077ZN2F83,"The right price, good quality, I buy them every 6 months or so, polish the silver with the old ones",5
B077ZN2F83,"The other white Tshirts I ordered in this same size were snug, these fit loose and comfy.  They seem to be worth the price.  Good quality.",4
B077ZN2F83,"Bought this set of tees for wearing at home. These are made of cotton, hence, quite comfortable. There is little shrinkage after few washes, however, they fade in color. The gray and blue do not look good once they have faded ! The red holds its color the longest before even it starts to fade.Will not buy again.",5
B077ZN2F83,Tees in a 5 pack of assorted colors...black..dark gray and light grey arrived quick with 2 day Prime shipping. Shipped in original package with no cover soft Amazon pack ..showing contents open on display..not cool.  Ordered XL size and so far fit seems ok.,5
B077ZN2F83,These tshirts are not the best fit. It could be my fault. I still like the colors. K gave them to my nephew. I loved them.,4

B077ZN2F83,The shirts are super comfortable. I liked the variety of the shades of blue.,5
B077ZN2F83,I get these to wear to work everyday and I get pretty dirty and greasy and they get washed a lot and hold up good,5
B077ZN2F83,"These are my 2nd and 3rd batch buying them. I just wish they would just let us buy a package of same color. Grey are hard to find, this is the only company selling them in my size. I don't like their black or navy colors those just feel not good for some reason. But I love all the other colors they feel light and comfy.",5
B077ZN2F83,They are noce,5
B077ZN2F83,Fits like t-shirts should fit. Very minimal on shrinkage if you wash them right,4

B077ZN2F83,"I bought these for my husband. They are a very comfortable & soft cotton. Much better quality than another brand I bought at thw same time. They are perfect fit, not clingy. Perfect cotton, Warm when on a cool day & cool on a warm day.",5
B077ZN2F83,Wanted to advise that one of the Gildan tee shirts had a small hole at bottomIn the front.  Very disappointed.,4

B077ZN2F83,"I've had these 8 t-shirts,for 2 years. I'm a metalsmith. I'm not easy on them,and they're covered in Flux. Im just ordering more as a treat,because of the price.I wear them every day as a uniform of sorts.",5
B077ZN2F83,I've ordered two or three packages of these over the years.  My favorite undershirt brand out of the lot.  I'm on the slimmer side and the medium fits me perfectly.  Make sure to throw them in the dryer for a little better fit.,5

B077ZN2F83,Husband loves the fit,5
B077ZN2F83,"I live in a hot humid climate and I exercise outdoors.  These are my favorite tee shirts. They look nice too and I don't feel as though I'm being strangled around the neck.  I am also happy with the colors available and the quality.  It is not a thick cotton, but not too thin either.  They have really held up through many wearings and washings",5
B077ZN2F83,Great t shirts for the price,4
B077ZN2F83,Excelente calidad por el precio,4
B077ZN2F83,My go-to brand from now on.,5

B077ZN2F83,Great quality and price. Will definitely order again.,5
B077ZN2F83,Cheap,5
B077ZN2F83,"Good fit, very nice!",5
B077ZN2F83,Slim fitting and a little see thru though. Cool for undershirt.,4
B077ZN2F83,Se ven de muy buena calidad,5
B077ZN2F83,The T-shirts are thick cotton and very soft.,4
B077ZN2F83,"received this today, the shirts are ok and fit loose.  I received it just like in the picture. Open on one end but they were all there. There was no outer packaging, just in a bag like you would find in a store with a label on it.",4
B077ZN2F83,"I typically run between a L and XL for outer shirts.  I bought these hoping for a bit extra length than another order of Gildan I had for crew neck undershirts that ran a bit short at a Size L.  These were ENORMOUS and were super long in the sleeves, wide along my torso and ran halfway to my knees.I'm 6'3"" and 230lbs, so not exact a smaller size.  But these were a big overshot on the xl size, especially if they were going under a dress shirt - which is what I intended.  Will be returning for a L size and hoping that helps even things out.All in all, they felt like good quality and had a bit of synthetic texture to them - which I hoped for to help with moisture wicking.  I live in a southern climate and a 100% cotton t-shirt soaks up sweat in seconds.  Need something that helps draw it away and can dry out quickly.  Hoping the smaller size fit the bill!",4
B077ZN2F83,Item was well made..I just  ordered  the wrong size,4
B077ZN2F83,Great bang for your buck with this shirt package!  Fit how you would expect them too.,5
B077ZN2F83,My husband loves these T Shirts,5
B077ZN2F83,very comfortable,5
B077ZN2F83,I bought these for myself I'm always b uying tee-shirts for over 50 pairs of sneakers an every possible color so seen these I actually bought again what u suppose to do when the price is under 25 bucks for 5 pocket tees each one a different color there's never gonna be a place to beat this price I'm buying more having them sent print shopan softest ever,5
B077ZN2F83,nice item very high quality product,5
B077ZN2F83,"Hanes and others are functional but if you hold them in your own hands, you can feel the difference and Gildan is my winner.",5
B077ZN2F83,"I recently purchased a second order of these T-shirts. Gildan products are superior to most others, I think.",5
B077ZN2F83,"Gildan products have proven to be very comfortable and durable, especially their t-shirts. For less than $4 a shirt, you can't beat the price. The best thing I love about these t-shirts is that they are longer than other brands and don't shrink as much when washed. They also don't bleed a bunch of dye the first few washes, which can damage other clothes. Overall, these are products that fit and feel great and save you money.",5
B077ZN2F83,Husband loves them,5
B077ZN2F83,Can't beat the price and fast delivery!,5
B077ZN2F83,"Soft, comfortable,  if you want your shirts roomier I would go up a size.",5
B077ZN2F83,Recomendado. Son la talla precisa.,4
B077ZN2F83,"Shipped in plastic bag they came in, no protection to weather or being thrown around. Quality is good but delivery sucks",4
B077ZN2F83,The basic T-shirt set is great. Different colors in soft cotton with a v-neck style make the T-shirts super comfortable and fit wonderful.,5
B077ZN2F83,Nice t shirt,5
B077ZN2F83,"All shirts are of same built construction - I hate multiple qty packs not being the same lot, build or construction.Good quality stitching with nice cotton softness.",5
B077ZN2F83,Great value for these t shirts. They are perfect. Sized as described. Fits great.,5
B077ZN2F83,As expected you get what you pay for,5
B077ZN2F83,love these t shirt.. 100 percent cotton. feel good and look good.,5
B077ZN2F83,Excellent quality,5
B077ZN2F83,Bought these for my husband. He loves the feel of the shirt. He likes v neck shirts so these are perfect. Fit him well.,5
B077ZN2F83,"True to fit, good quality, soft material, long lasting.. I had them embroidered and use them for work and play.",5
B077ZN2F83,"muy buena calidad, muy bonitas, recomendado.",4
B077ZN2F83,Me quedaron a la media,5
B077ZN2F83,"Great functionality, shrinkage maybe a little in the laundr., breathable, seams are great, good wearabilty.",5
B077ZN2F83,Very nice product.I have rebought the product.,5
B086KKT21Y,"These are very soft and comfortable! The material feels like a t-shirt. The elastic band is comfortable and I don't notice when ai am wearing them. The quality is good and I have not noticed any fading or shrinking after repeated washes. They fit as expected. They are a really good value, the colors are as I expected them to be. I like these so much I have bought a few more packages since my first purchase.",5
B086KKT21Y,"I bought these for my Husband for Christmas. They are his go to Boxers. I got a size L and they fit him great. They are a soft cotton blend. He wears a 34 pants. They wash up great, and last a long time. Wife approved lol",5
B086KKT21Y,"They work and feel great,very soft and not to loose the only thing that I didn't like is the waistband roller up, I think it needs to be thicker",4
B086KKT21Y,My husband says that they are comfortable and they fit him well. The underwear are not too tight and not too loose. The fabric is comfortable.,5
B086KKT21Y,"Good value, very comfortable and you have to keep the boys happy",5
B086KKT21Y,"Soft, Comfortable durable boxers. They're very good and don't ride up thigh when wearing compression garment.",5
B086KKT21Y,"color great, fit nice except waistband does not retain it's snug after two washes",3
B086KKT21Y,"They are comfortable, but the waist band folds onto itself in the front for some reason. I never really notice it until I actually feel it with my hand so it's not that big of a deal",4
B086KKT21Y,The boxer shorts a true to size and good quality for the price. Too bad the seller sent the wrong color. I ordered the Blue color only option and received a pack of multi colored boxer shorts. Someone need to pay attention to what the customer ordered.,4
B086KKT21Y,Great boxers I bought my Son and he really likes them.,5
B086KKT21Y,The only boxers my husband will wear. 100% cotton,5
B086KKT21Y,They need to sew the button on better.,4
B086KKT21Y,Very loose and airy,5
B086KKT21Y,"Great quality, light weight and sizes true to size",5
B086KKT21Y,"These are a great choice for comfort and style and fit and...just about anything you can think of. The Man likes them for sports, too. These are his preferred style, the jersey knit. Very comfy, effortless wear and the ones he keeps ordering.",5
B086KKT21Y,Fits well and is comfortable and I love the colors!,5
B086KKT21Y,"I buy these for my husband and son...thankfully they wear different sizes or we would have a real laundry conundrum, lol.  They love the covered waistband and the fabric is soft.  Seem pretty durable as my son's set from last Christmas are still going strong.  My husband has some he has had for years that are just now giving out.  Perfect for men who buy their own underwear, since they only do it every five years, ha ha ha ha",5
B086KKT21Y,Perfect fit. Soft material.,4
B086KKT21Y,Good,5
B086KKT21Y,"These underwear fit well, are roomy and breathable.",5
B086KKT21Y,What can you say. It's underwear and fitsI wish you could give 5 stars without comment,5
B086KKT21Y,Fits comfortably.  Great with 1 button!,5
B086KKT21Y,"My son is 11, and after the whole kid pj phase, i needed something comfortable for him to strictly wear to bed.  He loves these!  Small fits a perfect size 16 kid.",5
B086KKT21Y,4 stars as the fit could be better. just a slight snugness under the elastic. i had other brands with pleating under the elastic and they feel better.,4
B086KKT21Y,Very comfortable,4
B086KKT21Y,I've ordered these before for my husband. He likes that they are soft & comfy.,5
B086KKT21Y,"I'm not sure if these have changed recently? They seem a bit smaller than the other times I have purchased the exact same ones, years ago. The price is a great value and we will make them work. I have had good experiences with these boxers, in the past, they last a long time!",3
B086KKT21Y,My husband loves them,5
B086KKT21Y,Hands down the best boxers for the price range they're in. So comfortable and they last a really long time.,5
B086KKT21Y,my son love it,5
B086KKT21Y,Material and size of fit is good. The reason I only gave 3 stars is that the seams where the cloth is stitched together is bulky and irritates my skin.,3
B086KKT21Y,"soft and comfortable - a bit short in the legs, but otherwise fit well",5
B086KKT21Y,They fit good and feel good.,5
B086KKT21Y,My son liked the fit,5
B086KKT21Y,Too thin,3
B086KKT21Y,"Like the material, however, the waistband is very wimpy. I just bought them, but I can't imagine they'll hold up (pun intended) very long.",3
B086KKT21Y,Material is soft and comfortable. Ordered Large based on waist size and the waist band fits well but the rest of the Boxers are baggy with loose material that bunches in the crotch.,4
B086KKT21Y,Fit nice product great color good price good light weight,4
B086KKT21Y,"waist band runs big, does not hold to waist",3
B086KKT21Y,"They were comfortable, he loved em",5
B086KKT21Y,These have always been comfortable. Especially in the waist. My only issue with them is I wish they made the waist band the same color as the color of the boxers also better colors . Otherwise they fit me great and I've been using this brand and type for a long time replacing them is easy cause the price .,4
B086KKT21Y,"The boxers are comfy and a perfect fit, gives me a sensational feeling wearing them",5
B086KKT21Y,"The quality on these is fantastic. They're soft and comfortable, lightweight yet the fabric is strong. The size fit perfect, it matched my husband's other sizes. The variety in colors is nice too. And they're so vivid! Plus they look great on him. His other boxers are so loose, but these have enough structure to look good on him without him losing the loose fit he prefers.",5
B086KKT21Y,my wife loves them in the summer,5
B086KKT21Y,"While these Hanes ComfortSoft boxers are incredibly comfortable and well-made, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the sizing can be a bit inconsistent, so it's essential to double-check before purchasing. Additionally, the colors in the multipack may vary, which might not suit everyone's preference for uniformity. Despite these small issues, the overall comfort and quality make these boxers a solid choice for daily wear.",4
B086KKT21Y,"Comfort is A+  Almost don't know you are wearing undergarment.  Bought different brands and styles seeking comfort and cooling.  These preformed the best of over others.  Repurchasing multiple more sets of these - found what is I really like for comfort, fit, and protection.",5
B086KKT21Y,"My husband has specific expectations when it comes to boxers. He wants them long, soft waist band, and breathable. These were everything he wanted and more. Great quality & quantity for the price. Easy access hole with privacy button for quick tinkle breaks and generous room in the groin area, so no chaffing. The material is great for guys who have a sweaty bottom and absorb nicely. Will be ordering more!",5
B086KKT21Y,"Likes: After wearing these several times, I like that the thin material is nice for summer wear. Also, as a matter of convenience, I can leave the fly buttoned and retrieve the necessary parts by easily pulling one leg of the shorts up....very convenient.1st review: 1-Super thin material not likely to hold shape or be durable;  2-Flimsy/thin waistband folds over on itself.2nd review: After wearing these regularly over the last three months I think that they are the most comfortable boxers of the nearly twenty assorted pair that I have. The waste-band isn't an issue, is very comfortable as are the shorts themselves. The softness of the material feels great, they don't bunch or twist, so I'm pleased with them.",5
B086KKT21Y,The material was thin compared to past purchased boxers from this brand.,4
B086KKT21Y,Good underware.,5
B086KKT21Y,"always order this brand, comfortable for me",5
B086KKT21Y,Long legs,5
B086KKT21Y,"I first bought these in a size large and after about a month they got way too big and left a lot of space exposed in between my legs, the second time around I thought medium and had the same issue. They felt good first couple of weeks and then stretched to where I could fit two my legs in one leg hole.",3
B086KKT21Y,"They're soft, but I didn't realize the waistband wasn't a ""normal"" one until I got it.Normally, the waistband is connected to the fabric but it seems like the fabric covers the waistband too, making it softer...which you may want, but for me they would occasionally ride down a little.",4
B086KKT21Y,"In addition to their value, they are well made and very comfortabe.",5
B086KKT21Y,Very soft fabric covered waistband. Very soft material and not as big in the legs as others.,4
B086KKT21Y,These underwear are built to last. The cotton is soft and last a few years.,5
B086KKT21Y,Felt comfortable,4
B086KKT21Y,"It has become more and more difficult for me to find good loose fit cotton boxers at the local stores. I was beginning to think that no one made them anymore. A quick search on Amazon revealed these Hanes Men's ComfortSoft Boxers. Finally! I found these, ordered them, and have been immensely satisfied with their comfort and fit. They are very comfortable and they truly breathe and are soft. Definitely, I will be purchasing some more.",5
B086KKT21Y,"One of the boxers already had loose threads, but other than that they are fine.",4
B086KKT21Y,"Not terrible however not the highest quality material pretty thin, but does Ride up Legs",4
B086KKT21Y,"Good for lounging in but not practical when walking, at least not for heavier guys, also waist band rolls, not the best but comfortable, good as sleep clothes (weather permitting)",3
B086KKT21Y,nice fit and comfortable but only time canl tell for how long,4
B086KKT21Y,These are so comfortable I wash my clothes more so I do not have to use my old underwear as often.,5
B086KKT21Y,Well made.  Softens the more washed.,5
B086KKT21Y,"This feels like a t shirt and stretchy really well and feels great, not constricting.",5
B086KKT21Y,Comfy and soft,5
B086KKT21Y,Good boxers and they fit!,5
B086KKT21Y,"I'm not new to Hanes underwear, I am new to these boxers though. They are very soft almost tee shirt like. They have a button fly to prevent special guest appearances. These are tighter fitting than some but by no means are they restricting. They are made in Vietnam and that can be a problem for some men, I had boxer briefs from Hanes also made in Vietnam I couldn't get them up over my thighs these don't have that problem. They are a little short on the legs so at the right angle you could pop out the leg. The fly is cut quite a bit higher than other boxers, and it seems that there is a hard time getting it right; Hanes are too high Fruit of the Loom too low it seems no one ever hits the sweet spot! No tag in the back to get stuck in your crack. The material again super soft they don't cut into your legs to sleep like boxer briefs can, they  do have a tendency to make you warm these might not be the best for hot humid climates or for summer wear. I will wear these primarily around the house to sleep and lounge in but will continue to wear boxer briefs to go out everything just stays better in a good boxer brief but for sleeping you can't beat these boxers!  Machine wash COLD NO FABRIC SOFTENER (including dryer sheets). Will say that I ordered the 6 pack and was sent the 5 pack which was A supposedly out of stock and B $4.49 less than the 6 pack currently waiting on my refund, So 5 stars for the boxers 3 stars for ordering/customer service!",4
B086KKT21Y,These are comfortable and soft and they fit as expected. As for the thickness they're about what you would expect from underwear. If you're concerned with them being too revealing as a man you're fine. They are thick enough to allow for some modesty.,4
B086KKT21Y,"Fresh, comfortable and the best part is that you don't even fee them on.",5
B086KKT21Y,"Found Hanes to be my best fit for men's underwear and very comfortable too!  Since I'm kinda large, these shorts fit me just right and leave enough room to move around in too .............and men you know that is important!  For the money, its hard to beat Hanes underwear!",5
B086KKT21Y,Great boxer shorts,5
B086KKT21Y,"I wore these at my boyfriend's house one night, and the lot instantly became mine. If you want breathability while you sleep, these are where it's at! They're a bit rough when they arrive, so be sure to wash them before wearing, and know they absolutely get softer with every wash. Super comfortable for women. Stand aside, guys!Update: I was SO excited to get these (I bought them in the past from Walmart and wanted another pack). I'm 5'9"" weighing in at about 150 lbs and bought a size Large, but they are too small. I think I would have been better off with an Extra Large. I should have just gone back to Walmart, where at least I could have exchanged them for the correct size. Very disappointed!",3
B086KKT21Y,"So I bought these boxers for my husband because it was time for him to say out with the old and in with the new. He was pretty happy when they arrived because they were super soft and fit just as expected. When he came home from work the first day of wearing them, he said throw them all away. I laughed and asked why and he turned around and showed me. These things have a thin waistband That don't actually hold the boxers where they're supposed to be, so if you happen to be moving around a lot, they will give you a mega wedgie and the top rolls all over the place. How do you have a wedgie and folded over underwear at the same time? He wears them around the house now under his pajamas from time to time, and he'll wear them under his jeans if all he's doing is driving or having dinner or something, but he absolutely can't wear them to work because within minutes these things are just all over the place and don't sit right. He showed me, it's hilarious and unfortunate and probably super uncomfortable.Positive note - They are the most comfortable boxers that I now own! LOL! I'm one of those women who likes to wear boxers to bed, they're so comfortable. Who wouldn't? Anyways, they were so soft that I stole half of them since he really doesn't like them anyways, and they are the most comfy PJ bottoms ever. So soft and it's really nice that the waistband isn't very tight because it makes sleeping in the more comfortable. I can understand why he can't wear these at work though.Unfortunately only giving these three stars though because they didn't serve the purpose that I purchased them for at all. If you're buying these to relax in karma or you don't have a very active lifestyle or workday, these might be great for you. Not for us though!",3
B086KKT21Y,"This is a good buy, quality for price. They could be a bit softer for comfort but otherwise they're great.",4
B086KKT21Y,Good quality fabric is soft and nice. Great value for money,5
B086KKT21Y,"Love the fit, love the softness but it can be more soft and fabrication is thin but this the price is great.",4
B086KKT21Y,Great,5
B086KKT21Y,"The size is good for, but it describes the quality is not the best but considered in the price is a good quality the weight and the colors are Satisfactory",5
B086KKT21Y,These are very inexpensive shorts but clear example you get what you paid for. The material while soft is extremely thin and stretches a lot when you are wearing them to the point they become too big. They will shrink when you wash them and then stretch out again. In terms of sizing when new order regular size or maybe 1 size smaller as they do stretch out. I am usually a small but ordered a medium after reading some reviews and they were way too big. Returned and got the small and those are closer. They are cool and good for summer but that's about it,3
B086KKT21Y,The product is great. Lightweight and durable. Comfortable and roomy just what I needed. I also use them for shorts for sleeping.,5
B086KKT21Y,Lot of undies for a great price.  Nice quality.,5
B086KKT21Y,"Love these, I bought a second order of them after the first came. A little on the cheap side but I'll buy another set eventually. I am normally a 50 inch waist and the 3x fits comfortable and loose",5
B086KKT21Y,All good . Very comfortable.. Shipped well.,5
B086KKT21Y,Soft and comfy,5
B09R82W413,"I wear these distance running. They're very comfortable, no chaffing, fit well, and they're pretty good at wicking away sweat. They're snug but not tight. They also don't wear out very fast. These are as good as underwear that cost 3x more.",5
B09R82W413,"What can I say about these other than as someone who has never worn boxers before I'm impressed by the fit. They're very comfortable, breathable, and have plenty of stretch to them. I ended up buying a few more pairs to replace my regular underwear. There are a couple issues I will mention however. If you're a big guy go with the long leg design. Despite their claims it won't roll up I had issue with the regular doing just that. The long leg design doesn't for me personally. Quality-wise I'd say they are pretty durable and you probably won't need to worry about them tearing though one pair I have the stitching came loose. Still, I'm satisfied enough that I plan to buy more in the future.",4
B09R82W413,Best underwear I have ever had. Great support were you need it. I like the material. Feels good and cool. Not like cotton. I bought some the other day and liked them so much I bought some more. I would recommend buying.,5
B09R82W413,"These fit me well. My new preference in boxers. They don't ride up on me, prevent my thighs from rubbing on each other. Keeps the coin purse tucked up out of the way.I'm 6ft 185lbs 34in waist, large fit perfect.",5
B09R82W413,"The long leg and junk sack make this the most comfortable and anti chaffing underwear I've ever owned, at an affordable price compared to other high end brands that don't perform as well. I'm 5'8"" 215# and purchased the L long legged for the perfect fit.",5
B09R82W413,"I got these in an XL because I've gained a little weight and have an issue with elastic putting pressure on my lower back.Needless to say, the elastic on these feels like the elastic of my largest and may or may not stretch a little bit with wearing them.The description says there is a ""pouch"" design to the front but all that actually is are 2 extra flaps of material which tuck into the creases between your thighs and crotch. When reading the description it leads you to think they're like the boxers with the pouch that keeps your junk separated BUT its nothing even close to that even if these might prove comfortable in sweaty situations after getting used to them.I don't find the sizing to be accurate at all and feel these are not larger than the larges I own already and I am fairly disappointed in these at this time but I will give them some time to break in as they are brand new and have not been worn for more that a couple hours at this point.The 3 stars is gonna stay because I expected far more from Hanes especially since all my other boxer briefs are Hanes as well. I've been brand loyal and partial to Hanes for many years but I'm definitely considering a brand change after these and the last pack of large that I bought having sizing and elastic issues.",3
B09R82W413,I've tried several name brand underwear. I have big junk and I like to keep it tucked away. These are the best underwear I have tried that keeps them in place all day in my 10-hour shift. The tight fabric keeps my area from running down my leg. I HIGHLY recommend these if you need to keep your junk in place.,5
B09R82W413,These are very comfortable and stretchy. I like the different colors of the trunks. I also like the pouch that it has. Everything holds up well.,5
B09R82W413,I love the pocket for my junk but someone needs to tell hanes that their waistbands are uncomfortable,4
B09R82W413,Easy feel and no dlippage and very comfortable under golf psntsy,5
B09R82W413,Had this for about 2 to 3 years and they are still firm and strong elastic is truly reliable. FABRIC IS COMFORTABLE LOVE IT,5
B09R82W413,Very comfortable,5
B09R82W413,These were a little more expensive than we usually spend on underwear but my husband loves them. They were a great stocking stuffer. Good for bigger guys that deal with sweating down there. Feel like good quality.,5
B09R82W413,The best.,5
B09R82W413,"These are comfortable, breathable. Love them",5
B09R82W413,I like longer length spandex so I bought these based on their description. They are shorter than I like even though they say long length. They fit snug and are soft just wish they were a little longer,4
B09R82W413,"I wore Under Armour for 15 years. They were solid. These aren't built as well, but the ball pouch in the front is a game changer. My old ones feel weird now. I have the cotton-ish version of these too. These synthetic ones are a bit tight so I use them mainly for exercising and hiking. The cotton ones are my dailys",4
B09R82W413,Always get these for my husband. He likes the pouch in them to hang on to his goods. Very soft and comfortable for a blue collar man.,5
B09R82W413,Finally found a product that keeps everything in place comfortably.  Highly recommend,5
B09R82W413,Size is a bit smaller and tighter. But they are like silk so not too bad. Still comfortable. And happy with price.,4
B09R82W413,Great fit. Keeps moving parts in their place comfortably.,5
B09R82W413,like the designs. the hammock is a blessing for the family jewels. best yet.,5
B09R82W413,fit good,5
B09R82W413,My husband has now resorted to only using these underwear as they really help with chafing and sweat resistance. These are a good price for the quantity and six months later they are still holding strong with no holes.,5
B09R82W413,Perfect fit,5
B09R82W413,these look good definitely on a thinner side and the pouch does its trick.,5
B09R82W413,Nice fit,5
B09R82W413,Good,5
B09R82W413,Great buy,4
B09R82W413,"I order these for my husband and he loves them. He works at a sawmill so he gets hot in the summer, bends and squats ALOT. He says everything stays where it is supposed to! No riding up the thighs, no wedgies and his equipment stays supported and comfy-no pinching when he squats. The material is breathable and soft so he doesn't feel like he has moisture just clinging to him. 10/10 from the working man.",5
B09R82W413,These underwear are very comfortable and stay in place. They were a good buy. I like them very much.,5
B09R82W413,Exactly the right size and what he needed.  Great value.,5
B09R82W413,Superior fit and feel!,5
B09R82W413,I thought these were great but why did these double in price? They were $9.99 3 weeks ago. That is very unfair to the consumer.,5
B09R82W413,sorry no pics !  Lol these are so comfortable and they look good trust me on that one!,5
B09R82W413,good,5
B09R82W413,"These feel amazing and are extremely comfortable. Easy to wash and Its nice that they come in a pack of different colors. Great quality from my experience and fit extremely well. Also, the pricing is pretty darn good.",5
B09R82W413,Good quality,4
B09R82W413,Good,5
B09R82W413,"I purchased 3 packs of these when they were on sale and my husband loves them! They are really good quality, the size was perfect, the color has yet to fade in the wash like most undergarments tend to do.",5
B09R82W413,"Admittedly I am an underwear snob and usually only wear designer ones, but these are surprisingly comfortable and will be great for daily wear.  I can go between small or medium sizes normally, and I went with medium for less restriction, and I think that was a good move.  They fit but are not snug, allows for a bit of movement as opposed to a more work out/athletic tighter feel",5
B09R82W413,Feels comfortable and looks ok,4
B09R82W413,Le quedaron perfecta y son de buena calidad,5
B09R82W413,"They are a perfect fit, I purchased the medium size and husband indicates that they are very comfortable. They are worth purchasing again.",5
B09R82W413,"Best underwear I have found, very comfortable to wear. No riding up my legs like a lot of underwear and of course good support for the boys.",5
B09R82W413,The fabric feels sexy.,5
B09R82W413,Was told they were awesome.Nice & soft and keep everything in place.,5
B09R82W413,"It's good, but the pouch is not that supportive after a while. You have to pull up on the shorts to get support then after a while no more support when they come back down. Overall it's nice underwear though, regardless of pouch. Thin material and feels good. The colors are good in the long version.",4
B09R82W413,I was skeptical when I opened the package. They felt so flimsy and feminine. But so far they're everything they claim. They seem to wick away moisture extremely well and are comfortable. We'll see how they hold up.,4
B09R82W413,"I really like these so far. It's winter, so I haven't exactly tested the 'cooling' claim to the max by any means, but they're comfortable, rarely ride up my leg, and I do like the shape of them. They look good as well and seem to be made well enough to last a while.",5
B09R82W413,I haven't heard one complained yet,5
B09R82W413,Epic,5
B09R82W413,Purchased second set for my husband. Used to wear white briefs. Finds these so much more comfortable and breathable.,5
B09R82W413,"My husband says they are very comfortable, fit true to size, they are durable and do not shrink when washed. They are well worth the money and he loves the color options.",5
B09R82W413,These are my first timing buying and using underwear like this.  I will definitely be buying more of this product in the future.  Fits and breathes well.  No issues in the wash.  Overall a great product,5
B09R82W413,"I have an issue where I get severely chafed when walking all day in hot climates on vacation.  Like, beyond description.  I've tried every style of underwear out there to help with this and these are the only ones that actually work because they have the divider things on each side that goes between your leg and your stuff on each side.  If you're armed with these and maybe a little gold bond bottle in your pocket, you are ready to face the jungles of Central America and the longest days in the Disney heat you could ever come across.  I wear regular boxers or boxer briefs most of the time, but these are THE ONES when you need to walk, run or exist in hot, humid climates.  HANES:  Please don't ever change this model.  Other than I'd kind of like some in pure white if you could manage it.",5
B09R82W413,Exact fit and comfortable.,5
B09R82W413,"True to the title. When my cotton briefs wear out, I will buy more of these.",5
B09R82W413,"Good for the first 6 months or so but now I can't get the smell out of them. I primarily use these for exercise and so they get smelly, no detergent helps now. Also, the pouch support works when I'm standing or sitting but when I'm doing lots of back and forth athletic movement, it does not function as intended.",3
B09R82W413,Great Uware!  Will buy again.,5
B09R82W413,"Comfortable , they get the job done.",4
B09R82W413,For men on construction field in summer ... its best,5
B09R82W413,Love the pouch and moisture wicking. Keeps everything locked in and dry on my runs. Origionally bought them for a vasectomy and they worked great for those too. These are currently my go to for my long runs. Fabric is holding nicely and only showing sighs of wearing after a few hundred miles.,5
B09R82W413,He says he will not buy any other ones from now on.,5
B09R82W413,I love the material and they fit really well. They stay in place well and the legs don't roll up.,5
B09R82W413,got these for my bf. he says they're comfortable and fit very nicely,5

B09R82W413,"My husband loves these underwear so when I saw the sale price, I snatched up a couple sets. Nice quality, comfortable, and they allow for both support and air circulation.",5
B09R82W413,"Great fit XL would rather have a little more of a pouch and horizontal fly, great price.",4
B09R82W413,"I just had surgery on my spermatic cord. It is very painful ful. The Dr said I needed supportive underwear.  These have been amazingly supportive for my needs. Just the slightest movement right now is painfully. These really help control that. The material perfectly cups my testicles. The lighter material helps them breath. There is a useful fly up front, been a life saver. Will be purchasing a second set today.",5
B09R82W413,"i got these in size medium.  i am really starting to like them..  I was outside in 90 degree high humid weather for a while and was sweating my buff off,  these claim to wick away sweat and keep you dry,  if you wear the correctly,  The pouch is weird and a little awkward but if used correctly they do seem to wick what felt like all the moisture..  came back inside and my lower back was drenched in sweat.. normally other locations on my body are also drenched.  well not anymore.i think they do fit a little tight,  when i first put them on i was like oh man these are quite snug but after a few minutes i don't notice it so i would say that is probably better than too big i guess.originally i was not a fan of these but after wearing them for several days i have changed my mind.",5
B09R82W413,"I wasn't sure about buying these because they're slightly different from the Hanes that I currently wear. But the sale price made it a must buy, at least to try them out. Especially because the exact x-temp style that I wear is no longer made. Once I received them and tried them on I was sold. They are so incredibly comfortable, stretchy, and don't ride up. I liked them so much that I have now swapped out all of my underwear for these as I've purchased 2 more packs. I especially love these during my workouts. I would highly recommend this style of Hanes long leg boxer briefs. And no need to alter current sizing.",5
B09R82W413,"This underwear is by far the most comfortable i have ever worn. After wearing these, all other underwear is comparable to wearing burlap sacks. I'm old, and have worn many brands and styles. These are the best. Ever.",5
B09R82W413,Best underwear I have worn. Very comfortable and they stretch with ease for comfort and no worries about the fly opening by accident. Only underwear I will buy now.,5
B09R82W413,These are so. Freaking. Comfortable!! They keep the dangly bits separated from everything else and half the time it feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.,5
B09R82W413,These are so comfortable and do not bind in a certain area like most boxer briefs.,5
B09R82W413,Got these for my boyfriend and he loves them. they are very comfortable and supportive.,5
B09R82W413,Supported the junk well,5
B09R82W413,Unbelievably comfy!  The boys love it!!!,5
B09R82W413,My son-in-law asked for more thisChristmas so they must be nice. I bought 6 more pairs,5
B09R82W413,Nice fit and look amazing,5
B09KF1THGX,"Soft and comfortable, excellent!!!",5
B09KF1THGX,"These briefs are not cheap. But they're silky and sexy, and comfortable -- so I was told -- and they fit him perfectly.",5
B09KF1THGX,"Boxers are great, comfortable, ball pouch holds your nuts in place for a while but with movement, sitting and standing they can slip out.  Great but not worth the money you pay for them.  Save your money and buy 5 pairs of normal underwear for the cost of 1 of these.",4
B09KF1THGX,The ball hammock is great. Fabric is soft and comfortable. Not to thick or too thin. The design is just perfect! Ha,5
B09KF1THGX,The material is soft and breathable! True to size. Good stretch. Fun colors and designs!,5
B09KF1THGX,good birthday gift and many choices to choose from,4
B09KF1THGX,Great Fit! does exactly what it states that they will do!!,5
B09KF1THGX,brought as a joke but they are nice quality,5
B09KF1THGX,No idea of how to return purchase. All bad as in rip off.,4
B09KF1THGX,I like everything about these except the pouch is a little on the small side. Very comfortable otherwise.,4
B09KF1THGX,very comfortable,5
B09KF1THGX,Quality look superior,4
B09KF1THGX,It could be anything!,5
B09KF1THGX,My husband said they are the most comfortable he has ever worn,5
B09KF1THGX,He loves the support!,5
B09KF1THGX,Nice fabric,5
B09KF1THGX,My wife loved these after our wedding,5
B09KF1THGX,He says most comfortable out of all of them,5
B09KF1THGX,"Soft, sexy, cool and seriously comfortable.",5
B09KF1THGX,"Sometimes after wearing them for long periods of time, it feels like the ball pocket is chaffing into my scrote. If your boys just happen to fall out of the pocket, it gets very uncomfortable and you have to go find a private place to get all fixed up again. Other than that, these are very comfortable.",5
B09KF1THGX,It was a gift,5
B09KF1THGX,My husband just loved the feel of the underwhere,5
B09KF1THGX,I purchased a pair for my husband and he liked them and asked me to order some more for him .  I took advantage of the special they had of getting two for a cheaper price but they would pick them out for me.  I received them and they were both the same pattern.  I was disappointed. I would of pick two different patterns.,3
B09KF1THGX,Super soft! They keep me from sitting on them which is a struggle. Would definitely buy again!,5
B09KF1THGX,He usually wears a size xl  but a large would suit him better.,4
B09KF1THGX,Hubby really loves them.,5
B09KF1THGX,"The pouch doesn't cradle my husband's balls, it actually hinders the natural movement of the penis throughout the wear. He tried to wear these for a party and the head of his oenis kept getting caught in the ball hammock. Not comfortable or well designed.",3
B09KF1THGX,"were great while they lasted, but boy oh boy when there's one tiny rip, they basically unravel.",4
B09KF1THGX,"I bought it with my size of underwear, and it was the wrong size.The whole thing is amazing. It did help with my stuff. It's also soft and stretchy, but kinda thick too.Fabric is good",4
B09KF1THGX,Very nice and soft and comfy,5
B09KF1THGX,"He said these are by far the best underwear he has ever worn in his entire life.  This is a man that HATES underwear because they are ""too restrictive"" and uncomfortable.  He has tried briefs, boxers and boxer briefs and hated all of them.  He said these are the softest, most comfortable and that it doesn't even feel like he's wearing underwear!",5
B09KF1THGX,The Fellas is happy. What else can I say.,5
B09KF1THGX,"For what these are and how they feel and fit they are way too expensive. They employ a support system that is almost identical to other brands (Haines) that at a third of the price, and yield at least the same if not better results. I recently discovered that I needed more supportive underwear and not just underwear that looked good. I have tried nearly every brand available on Amazon and this was three times the price of all of the other brands. The support is just about there but requires constant "" repositioning "" if you get my meaning. I would not buy these again or recommend them to others.",3
B09KF1THGX,There are no seams that are uncomfortable. The pouch is better than others I've tried. They are very soft and supportive.,5
B09KF1THGX,Good fit and size chart,5
B09KF1THGX,This underwear is very comfortable and fits well. the only issue is the hammock part of the underwear is not perfect but will do for now.,4
B09KF1THGX,True to size. Holds up in the wash. Comfortable. Patterns are hilarious and just as pictured.,5
B09KF1THGX,My husband loves these but wishes the hammock area had a more fabric. Otherwise almost perfect design.,4
B09KF1THGX,Cute and comfortable,5
B09KF1THGX,"Very comfortable, well made!",5
B09KF1THGX,"Comfortable, breathable, Fun!",5
B09KF1THGX,"The boxers are great. They're a bit expensive, but that's all I wear now. But Amazon, on the other hand they're constantly screwing up. I bought the pair that was pictured and they sent a total different pair. Altogether, so now I have two of the same paris.",5
B09KF1THGX,Excellent fit. My husband loves them.,5
B09KF1THGX,"I bought one pair for my husband, he loved them so much he wanted another pair! He says of all his different kinds of underwear these are his favorites!",5
B09KF1THGX,"(updated review) underwear is somewhat more loose than the other brands I tried at the same time, still fits, the junk separation is not as good as the other brands I've tried, there is really only a pouch and unlike other brands the pee-flap is all the way on the left end on the junk-pouch for some reason, still works but it's more clunky than other things you could choose, I would imagine you'd choose these underwear if you're trying to tease/impress someone since they do emphasize the contour of your junk, and they are very colorful. Just not as practical for every day use in your 9-5.(previous review) Was emailed to leave a review before Ive had a chance to really test the underwear, bought 3 different brands all at once that all claim to do similar function,Of three these, these rank #2 but I have not had enough time to say why.Other brands have the firehose flap directly acessable to human anatomy, where as these underwear hide the hose separation to the left of your crotch instead of the middle, might mean these underwear are meant for single pouch as opposed to separating firehose & nuts, like other brands have done.Again, haven't used long enough to rate good or bad, seller shouldn't provoke premature reviews lol.",4
B09KF1THGX,My son loves these. Will only wear this brand now,5
B09KF1THGX,"I wear size 5 xl underwear, in fact  I purchased  mu underwear on Amazon. I liked the idea of the Hammock underwear, having my doubts I ordered one pair. It took to long to get them as they mailed them. When I received them I noticed they are very flimsy, I tried them on and could not get them over my butt. Its not possible that they were 5 XL.  On TV they said don't like them, you keep them and we'll refund your money. Ironically, I had to send them back to get my refund. I should add even if they fit the cost of one pair is too much. They sell the same underwear on their web cite for $10.00 more. I can't recommend them especially knowing that they take back underwear that has been tried on. Gross !",3
B09KF1THGX,Really soft and the hammock is better than others I tried but they ride up really bad.,3
B09KF1THGX,"Shinesty supports the package just as they claim it will.  Very comfortable, the fabric/material feels so good against your skin.  Ive purchased several pair.",5
B09KF1THGX,Perfect gift,4
B09KF1THGX,"Husband has had the same batch of underwear for 10+ years. I had seen the ads and figured buying one pair wouldn't hurt.  I swapped out a pair of his older underwear while he was in the shower with a pair of the Shinesty boxer briefs (they had similar colors) and at first he didn't notice. When he went to pull them up, he was a bit confused. I told him how they 'work' and he was reluctant to wear them...at first.  By the end of the day he asked if I could purchase more of them! This coming from the guy who didn't want to buy underwear because no one sold his underwear in 'only gray' packs.  Not only are they comfortable for him, but they look nice from my perspective, too. ;-) Perfect amount of stretch, he doesn't 'adjust himself' nearly as much as he does with his older underwear (I performed 'scientific' investigations for a whole day on him), and has super soft material (coming from both him and I).",5
B09KF1THGX,Very happy w the purchase just wish they weren't so we expensive...hopefully they'll become cheaper and we can switch him out but 30 bucks for 1 pair lol it was a father's day gift but I ain't paying 114.00 for 3 pairs of boxers hahaha sorry so SHISTY whoever yall are drop that price or you'll loose ALOT of ur clientele just saying!,5
B09KF1THGX,"My husband loves these and says they are the most comfortable he has ever worn, but it is still too pricey for me to purchase a lot. Just got them at Christmas so we will see how well they hold up.",4
B09KF1THGX,"I bought these for my husband.  He appreciates the way they fit. They are true to size. The material is buttery soft, and the waistband isn't irritating. Very flattering. Nice enough that after wearing the first pair we ordered more.",5
B09KF1THGX,"I bought a pair because the tv ad made tham sound so good. It was right, they are amazing. Keeping the boys snug and comfortable. However, they are too expensive to replace the entire collection. I will be trying some imposter underwear to find a substitute that is in my price range.",4
B09KF1THGX,Perfect fit!!,4
B09KF1THGX,The fabric is soft and feels great.  But the pouch is not what it's hyped to be.  I've worn UFM boxer briefs for the last year or so and they are far superior to these.  If you want real pouch support check UFM out.  I'm glad I only bought one pair of the shinesty brand...They are soft so I'll probably use them to sleep in,3
B09KF1THGX,"I love Shinesty underwear. They fit well, they wear well, and they last. I purchased 7 of the mystery solid option of this and received all green. I get that it's ""Dealers Choice"" but I find it pretty poor to get 7 of the same in a mystery order. I'll keep em, but I was hoping for a little variety.",3
B09KF1THGX,Boyfriends 60 years old and always wore white briefs until now.  Bought a pair as a gag gift and he loves them.  Says they keep him cooler and keeps his manhood in place.  I have bought 5 pairs now.  He wants the shorter version so looking for the trunks now.,5
B09KF1THGX,No dislikes!,4
B09KF1THGX,Bought these for hubbie and he said he stated he loves them,5
B09KF1THGX,"I like the fit and feel. The Hamock is a bit of a gimmick as the boys go where they want as the day goes on.  I haven't had them long enough to talk about how long they last but so far I have ordered twice and both times the patterns I ordered show up wrong. They must have a lot of the green and red ""elf"" style because I have never ordered that pattern but, now I have two pair! Thus the three stars.",3
B09KF1THGX,We live in Florida and My husband is very susceptible to heat rash due to the high humidity. These boxers are a game changer!,5
B09KF1THGX,"i accidentally bought the wrong size for my partner so im glad i only bought one, but even with that, he tried these out for a whole working day (lawn care, hike and 10hr shift in a kitchen) and he had no complaints about uncomfortabilities or anything. he overheats easily so im pleasantly surprised that he wasnt bothered with these! hes happy, im happy.",5
B09KF1THGX,Love this! So cute and funny. Great quality. Light weight. Fit great. My son loves them!,5
B09KF1THGX,"My son is a rugby player and prefers having longer underwear under his shorts.  He loves the theming of this pair, and indicates that the *ahem* pocket for the jewels is absolutely great at holding things where they are supposed to be.  The durability has been great and softness has been maintained despite many washings.",5
B09KF1THGX,only comment is there are other competitive briefs for a lower price,4
B09KF1THGX,Like the fit - true to form on size.  Stretchy and comfortable.  I would like more pouch room for the family jewels.  Otherwise - good product.,4
B09KF1THGX,I sweat like crazy and these are hands down the most comfortable underwear I've ever owned. I really don't sweat much in these and they feel great. I can wear jeans in summer temps and not get super uncomfortable which is a first for me. Highly reccomend. I'll be replacing my whole drawer eventually. Went from 1 pair to 5 already.,5
B09KF1THGX,My husband loves these mens briefs.. the hammock style is very comfortable!,5
B09KF1THGX,very comfortable and works well but the price is way to high.I bought one pair to try them out at $29.99 and decided the price was was too much to buy any more.i do like the idea of them because they do work well.,4
B09KF1THGX,My husband didn't really think these were more comfortable than any other underwear but still as comfortable as others. I would compare prices and shop compare with other similar styles and if these are less than go for it because they are just as good.,4
B09KF1THGX,"These briefs fit great, and pocket is very comfortable. The cotton fabric feels good on your skin, unlike many of the polyester and spandex options.",5
B09KF1THGX,"The designs of fabric are Great,  sizes are accurate,Don't breath as well as Hanes, and more expe",4
B09KF1THGX,"I bought a pair really as a joke, but he really likes them. I find them funny and I like things that make me laugh.",5
B09KF1THGX,A great product.,4
B09KF1THGX,I've tried many different kinds and these are the best.,5
B09KF1THGX,Bought these for my husband. He loves how comfortable they are. But they also help him with the extreme heat. Would recommend these.,5
B09KF1THGX,"I got these for my husband, kind of as a joke, but I saw the great reviews and he was in desperate need of some new boxers and I literally have to make sure these are washed it all times because he only wants to wear these now!!",5
B09KF1THGX,My husband loves them as always!,5
B084HLB8HM,"I bought my first pack a while ago and I've been slowly buying packs to phase out all my older underwear from other brands. It fits well, looks nice, and I like the material and comfortability. I would recommend anyone to buy a pack and see how you like it.",5
B084HLB8HM,"I have purchased these 3 times. Each time the quality is the same and they are very comfortable. However, the sizing is quite different across the orders, especially in the leg length. The length of the leg varies by up to 2 inches across the orders, despite being in the same packaging and labeled as the same style, material, and size.",4
B084HLB8HM,"Named brand Calvin K'lien are much better than the other brands. The set that i purchased could have been  a little bit bigger, the material is soft and expandable, very accommodative, stretch to fit,  looks good with manhood. A very good value for the bit of money.",5
B084HLB8HM,"These are probably the best I've ever had. They have stayed true to form without shrinking and are overall very durable compared to budget options from places like Target. The material is adequately thick, keeps its color, is comfortable without scratchiness, and does not overly ride up from excess construction or movement. There is ample room in the pouch for the well endowed.Great value and a way better buy than competitors like Hanes.",5
B084HLB8HM,Got these for my husband for Christmas. They are nice boxer briefs. They have held up nice through the laundry.,5
B084HLB8HM,"I initially like them. The cut felt different than other brands but they look genuine. After the first wash I noticed one of them has a hole in the crotch, and the elastic band on another was slightly deformed with fabric wearing off the top. I gave the third pair a try but by then end of the day they are more like boxers than boxers briefs. I might try again when they're on sale but not worth full price when cheaper brands have better quality.",3
B084HLB8HM,Great fit and great price,5
B084HLB8HM,Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loved it.,4
B084HLB8HM,Quality underwear,4
B084HLB8HM,Comfortable well made I will order more,5
B084HLB8HM,Cheaper than Macy's,5
B084HLB8HM,"Fits great, great price, great gift",5
B084HLB8HM,Gift for husband,5
B084HLB8HM,Muy buenos,5
B084HLB8HM,"Bought this for my husband(his account) and he loves them. I honestly like the look of a ball hammock brief better, but he is the one who has to wear them all day and says these feel better on the skin. The top elastic band does shrink up after laundering though so I discount a star for that.",4
B084HLB8HM,"I tend to purchase Calvin Klein boxers for my teen boys. They wash well and hold up, they fit nice. In this case, you get what you pay for.",4
B084HLB8HM,Lower quality material than expected but a good fit all around.,4
B084HLB8HM,Not the best But very good boxers they fit great and somewhat breathable.,4
B084HLB8HM,Get stretched out easily and then look baggy.,4
B084HLB8HM,Good quality but still not like the Haynes I preferred and can no longer find in stores or online.,4
B084HLB8HM,Not a lot of room in the XXL size.  Just fits.,4
B084HLB8HM,Everything is TOP NOTCH ! ! ! Looking forward to my next shipments.,5
B084HLB8HM,"Very comfortable underwear, but one of mine has a hole in the back after only a few months of use. I have been washing them on delicate settings too, to be fair I have bough 6 and only 1 has this problem, maybe it was a bad pair. Very comfortable underwear though.",3
B084HLB8HM,"These are perfect fit, and feel amazing.",5
B084HLB8HM,Should have ordered the stretch package,4
B084HLB8HM,A little oversized but their pretty comfy overall!,4
B084HLB8HM,Unlike other boxer briefs these seems to be quite nice.However that being said they are tight around the upper thighs. Yes everyone's body is different and hoping I get used to this set.,3
B084HLB8HM,So CK has great underwear but for those of you who love comfort these are my favorites! Great for men of all shapes. Keep in mind these are very different from the stretch boxer briefs which I bought and were not nearly as comfortable. BIG DIFFERENCE. If you like tight underwear the stretch versions can be good for running or gym but if you want comfort for lying around or feeling like you look good these are by far the superior option. They are my go to now after finding these!,5
B084HLB8HM,These undies are stylish and my lady loves the way I look in them.  I really like the way the fit and the band is strong as can be.CK is the best undies IMO and these don't disappoint!,5
B084HLB8HM,Would likely not recommend these. If between sizes would recommend going down.,3
B084HLB8HM,"I love that these are made of 100 percent cotton. When you first put them on they feel great. But after a few washings, the waistband starts to roll, and you can see the little threads of elastic starting to stick out - after only three to five washings. If not for that, I would rate them 5-stars.",3
B084HLB8HM,"great product. material is thick, soft & comfortable",5
B084HLB8HM,"very comfortable, true to size, don't ride up. I have too little butt to properly fill out the backside so after a day of wear and natural stretching, the support aspect is much reduced. Only slightly more supportive than cotton briefs due to the extended legs. Going to try a synthetic fabric next time around. I hope they might hold their shape enough after a day of sitting to provide good support for a vigorous workout.",4
B084HLB8HM,Great,5
B084HLB8HM,Muy buena calidad del material,4
B084HLB8HM,I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  The material is very comfortable and soft.,5
B084HLB8HM,"Material is of a good weight...not too thin and not too thick. Just right.Good fit, quality made.",5
B084HLB8HM,"I like  how they hold my junk, very comfortable.",5
B084HLB8HM,"I loved the fit, and the comfortable materials that included stretch. I consider these my favorite boxer brief, and a value for the money.",5
B084HLB8HM,"No shrinkage, nice fit.",5
B084HLB8HM,Its is important to me that its all cotten and not plended with somthing else. I bought others that were not 100 percent cotton and it irriteed my skin. Thrses are woth ever penny.,5
B084HLB8HM,"Thyere undies, they're comfy, not much more to say.",5
B084HLB8HM,Very good fit,5
B084HLB8HM,These are my boyfriends favorite. Got them on sale for $27,5
B084HLB8HM,Comfortable and nice cotton boxer brief. tailored in all the right places,5
B084HLB8HM,I got them for $10 cheaper here than buying other places.,4
B084HLB8HM,Great fit!!,5
B084HLB8HM,Comfortable fit,4
B084HLB8HM,It perfectly meets my expectations,5
B084HLB8HM,"seems like quality fabric, and i like the feel. I like my underwear a little on the snug side to keep everything in place. These are a little loose and fit more towards the side of regular boxers. I was expecting a snugger fit from CK",4
B084HLB8HM,Confortable and elegant,5
B084HLB8HM,Good,5
B084HLB8HM,Perfect. Needed some. Got some.,5
B084HLB8HM,Good boxers.Soft nice fabric. Nowadays isn't  easy to find 100% cotton boxer. Love CK! I good give 10 stars for this material!,5
B084HLB8HM,Nothing much to say other than they are comfortable and breathable. Make sure you do a size up as they do shrink after the first wash.,4
B084HLB8HM,"These fit kind of loose on the legs while being tight everywhere else which I thought was kind of weird. I'm a bodybuilder so it's not like I have super skinny legs either. I think I was just expecting a different fit more similar to other Calvin Klein underwear I've bought in the past. The fabric is really soft, if you're into the way these fit I would say 5/5 but I didn't like it very much so 3/5 for me",3
B084HLB8HM,Weak elastic stretches and ruins the lettering,4
B084HLB8HM,Excelente calidad y tiempo de entrega,5
B084HLB8HM,"Great! Exactly as pictured and described. Arrived when expected. Sizing chart accurate, too.",5
B084HLB8HM,These would be winter drawers,4
B084HLB8HM,"Like the black doesn't show stains, breathable.  Lasts thru many washings. Have purchased this item for several years.",5
B084HLB8HM,"Description says 100% cotton, but product is actually labeled as 95% cotton and 5% elastane (for stretch).",4
B084HLB8HM,These seem expensive. But I haven't yet found less expensive briefs that are comparable in quality and material.,5
B084HLB8HM,I love how flexible and soft this feels if you want high quality 100 percent cotten boxers get this not questions ask,5
B084HLB8HM,Comfortable & good quality.,5
B084HLB8HM,I bought Xl and definitely like the fitness and comfort of them. Definitely worth it and buying more of them,5
B084HLB8HM,Great fit and fabric quality.,5
B084HLB8HM,My husband liked them a lot,4
B084HLB8HM,Good,5
B084HLB8HM,Bad quality for the price. Less than a year and half of them are already in the little (trash can),2
B084HLB8HM,Very comfy and stretchy,5
B084HLB8HM,"These are not the premium Calvin Klein boxer briefs. I sadly bought them not knowing there was a Hanes type version, I'm pretty disappointed that I still have to go underwear shopping again.",2
B084HLB8HM,The colors are very good.  The fabric is softer than other underwear.  There is some support for my privates.  I like these briefs better than briefs with stretch fabric.  Stretch fabric may cause some sweating in sensitive areas.,5
B084HLB8HM,"I've been a CK underwear fan for years. Lately, they have been switching models and names more than usual and I've lost my favorite model (the 'CK 365'). These are a cotton material without the stretchy modal synthetic component and as a result seems to lose structural integrity the longer I wear them, i.e., they get too loose. Gradually the support of the boxer brief is lost. This is really disappointing. Paying more for CK branding and getting an inferior product is not in keeping with my past experience.",4
B084HLB8HM,They fit well and are very comfortable!,5
B084HLB8HM,great fit and material,5
B084HLB8HM,...,5
B0735T525V,"These are great every day sock. They're soft, comfortable and stay in place.",5
B0735T525V,"What can I say, they're socks.  Fit great, feel good.  Such a value.",5
B0735T525V,These socks were great they fit perfectly And the quality of them has been wonderful.,5
B0735T525V,"Cushy foot bed and nice thin upper, great for everyday wear.",5
B0735T525V,"The new synthetic is horrible, not sure what percent cotton, but it does not appear to be even 50%.The upper portion is not cotton at all.",5
B0735T525V,However after a few washes they softened up. They were quite uncomfortable on my feet at first now they are one of my go to sock when I open my drawer. I'd give a four however they kinda sucked at first. Not bad and good durability.,3
B0735T525V,My wife go through four packages a year of these work socks she loves them UPS baby,5
B0735T525V,If you're  looking for a really thick set of socks to buy then these are to die for,4
B0735T525V,still my husband's favorite...will order again when needed,5
B0735T525V,These are very comfortable socks. I'm On My Feet for almost the whole day at work and they last for a long time. They're very breathable the fit is great and the look is okay.,5
B0735T525V,"I purchased these recently after some young kid told me that they could tell how old I was because I was wearing ankle socks.  We fought for years to have ankle socks taking socks like this and folding them over to put them in our shoes and now we are considered corny for wearing short socks.  So to fit in with the youth and not be bullied by them I decided to purchase a set of crew socks.  I also wear boots for work so they help with the boot rubbing against my ankle, so I guess the kids ain't all wrong.  I will however not wear them with sneakers or slides because I think that is corny.  These feel comfortable and do what they need to do.  I have only worn them for a month but with most of the Fruit of a Loom socks I expect to get about a year out of them.  Hopefully I can have a year of being accepted before there are holes in the heal.",5
B0735T525V,Good fit,4
B0735T525V,These did ok for awhile. The price is right in line. But now some are getting holes in the heels from the work shoes. Just like the other brands. Work shoes are hard on socks. Would purchase again. They held up pretty good.,4
B0735T525V,These claim they are for sizes 6-12. I have size 8 feet and feel these socks are too large. I can't imagine wearing these with size 6 feet.,3
B0735T525V,"These are so very comfortable.  They wear well and so far, there isn't wear showing.",5
B0735T525V,Helps keep feet warm and dry.  I didn't notice any sweat.,5
B0735T525V,"This is the second time I bought these socks. I buy them because of the value, I don't want to sort through all the different socks. One type of sock makes the laundry easier to do.I would give five stars except the heels seem to wear out faster than the rest of the sock. My feet are well within the range of the size that these socks fit. But I notice the heels wear out too fast in an otherwise good sock. But this is why I keep buying the same type of sock. There always seems to be a partner for every sock now.",4
B0735T525V,"While the socks are comfy and fit well, there have been a couple of problems:First, a couple of the socks developed holes for no apparent reason after only a few weeks of use.  Second, the gray sole area comes up the side of the sock far enough that it shows over the side of a normal-height shoe, causing a poor appearance.  Further, the alignment of the seams between the black and gray colors differ from one side of the sock to the other, making things look even weirder.  So, the socks feel great, but look a bit weird - and may have a bit of a durability problem.",4
B0735T525V,Great quality and comfort. My husband loves them,5
B0735T525V,"They are good for the price. I bought them for my 14 year old because he ends up with holes in his socks quickly. The extra cushion/thickness on the foot has held off the holes for the time being. So far, so good",5
B0735T525V,I recommend,5
B0735T525V,Comfortable,5
B0735T525V,Husband loves these. Comfortable and great cushioning. He stands most of the work day and highly recommends these,5
B0735T525V,The socks are just as described. They fit well and are comfortable.,5
B0735T525V,I wear these with gum boots every weekend and walk about 30 miles with them. They held up really good. Not a single pair has holes yet. I followed the size chart and they fit comfortably,5
B0735T525V,But they are great work socks for in the office,5
B0735T525V,"bought a bunch of these last year, and they were great, just right thickness/loft.... not too thick or thin.So after a year of use, last years socks are a bit thread bare.... time to get some new ones ....OK so I re-up on these, got them yesterday & am wearing them today....Well Im not a happy camper, as these socks are a bit thinner in thread count than last years....that's right.... they are thinner and lighter.... not what I wanted!They are just too lightweight to make for a good summer work sock.... I would have to wear two pairs to get adequate foot protection for the kind of land clearing work I do in the woods -So - For me... they are good for nothing but wearing around the house -And... I will never order these socks again...No, these socks are not as they should be....and I do not recommend them.....Unless of course, you want thin socks..... not everybody needs thicker socks suitable for outdoor work right?Anyways.....",4
B0735T525V,"I actually like these socks, but they only rise about 4"" above my ankle. I wish they were 2""-3"" taller.",4
B0735T525V,"I was in the market for a new larger pack of black socks, which is where I point myself for all-purpose wear. I've been happy with Fruit of the Loom products before, they are always a good value for the quality. These are generally right in line with that experience. They are fairly thick for cotton socks, with a welcome bit of padding, but still light. The rib/cuff is just a tad looser than I would like, but avoids being constrictive. The sock mostly stays in place, I will have to see whether that lasts over time. Generally a good buy.",4
B0735T525V,Wonderful comfort and fits true to size,5
B0735T525V,"These socks are all that my husband will wear. He is on his feet for about 12 hours a day. He likes  them because they are soft, strong & thick.  They wash well & do not hold an odor. With the money!",5
B0735T525V,"I bought these for the homeless.  I tried on a pair myself. The elastic at the top is pretty tight. These are mens socks. I'm a 5'8' 150lb female. So I'm not heavy. I'm thinking these socks will be even tighter on men. I've rolled the socks up in a ball, hoping that will loosen the tops a little.I probably will not buy again.",2
B0735T525V,Product is better than expected being both comfortable as it seem durable .  I dropped one durability star only because I haven't worn it long enough .  I wear through socks since I basically walk 5 miles a day .  Certain asian manufactures' socks will only last half to a full day .,5
B0735T525V,"Nice socks for low-wear everyday use, but not thick enough to use as a work sock. I bought these for my husband who is an automotive technician and needs to wear long socks with his boots every day. Within two weeks a few pairs already had holes in them. Won my be buying again for him.",3
B0735T525V,good value for the money,4
B0735T525V,They are socks what more do you need to know good quality fit my husband big feet,5
B0735T525V,I got 12 pairs of these last year for Christmas. They're soft and comfortable and fit well. As soon as I got them I threw away all the old socks I had when I compared how they felt.,4
B0735T525V,honestly a better quality than I expected at the price point-,5
B0735T525V,Very comfortable and very easy to put on.,5
B0735T525V,Useful clothing needed,3
B0735T525V,Great price for decent socks.  I will say on the cheaper side for quality but that was expected.  One complaint though was the first pair I picked out. One sock felt a little tighter then the other.  Even swapped the socks and it still felt that way.  So far the others seem to be ok.  Maybe just the one sock.,4
B0735T525V,"It does what it does fine. But.... the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was that either the product or the batch I got has some very minor issues where the first time you wear them and take em off after using them for a few hours lint(?) comes attched to the bottom of my feet. Happens only the first time I wear a pair. Again, the socks are comfy and I don't know if the lint thing is a product issue or a less than perfect batch.",4
B0735T525V,"I really love these work socks. They are a perfect fit for my knobby feet, and are just high enough when worn. They have a lot of stretch, but aren't too tight either. Recommended!",5
B0735T525V,"The photos are HIGHLY misleading!  The socks are made really well.  Superb quality! However, they only come up to an inch over my ankles!  They are FAR from what the photos lead you to believe you're purchasing!",4
B0735T525V,"Some of the poorer reviews all said about the same thing: the quality of these socks has dropped from a few years ago. I cautiously bought a single pack to see for myself, and a hole showed up in the bottom of my foot at the end of a single day. I bought a ton of these before (not from this seller) years ago and it took them 2+ years before they even started showing normal wear and tear. Something about these socks is seriously different, and I honestly don't have enough confidence to buy them again... No problem with the seller though! Just want to stress that again. Everything about the transaction was on the level.",3
B0735T525V,"Fit well and comfortable. But 1 pair did unravel in the washer, the very 1st time washed. All the other pairs seem to be holding up for now, so the one pair may have been a fluke.",4
B0735T525V,Excelente producto es lo esperado,5
B0735T525V,"They're nice socks - look good, feel comfortable, and they're cheap. You get what you pay for though - any strenuous day will leave a ton of black fibers stuck all over your feet. It's pretty inconvenient and slightly disgusting but the price + others pros of the socks win out.",4
B0735T525V,"The socks themselves are really good. with the only complaint is that the image shows them going up farther on the leg then they actually do, they go up a couple inches from the top of my ankle.",4
B0735T525V,"I always have trouble with socks.  They don't fit right, the heel comes up too far.  There a seam... a seam... everywhere there's a seam...I like these socks.  I tried 8 different brands and styles.  I like these the best.  No noticeable heel markings so I don't have to worry if they're pulled up too far or if my shoe is too low.  No seam on my toes, under my toes, infront of my toes.  I feel nothing!  They are soft and comfortable.  They will leave some fuzzies in your toes after wearing all day, but who cares (besides my wife, she hates when they end up on the floor).  I'm replacing all my aging black socks with these.  Great for business/ business casual shoes for going to the office every day.  I do not wear these with my suit/dress shoes.",5
B0735T525V,"They arrived today and I tried them on. They feel decent but I noticed there a lil on the small side. Im a size 9, package says 6-12.  If your foot is bigger than a 9 USA there not going to fit ! So get the bigger size. Whatever the next size up is. I dont understand it but within the last few years. Pretty much every brand I try usually runs small. Then after washing them a few times. There so tight I have to throw them away. Hopefully these dont shrink much. Will see.....  One thing I was happy about it's a 10 Pair package. The description says 10 pack not 10 Pair. So yes its a 10 Pair pack (20 socks).",4
B0735T525V,"overall, a great product",5
B0735T525V,"Socks are ""Thinner"" than what I usually get when i order these.They now shipped in a  New China plastic bag -  rewrapped in a yet another  plastic bag with very faint fruit of the Loom Lettering.This will be my last purchase of these and i have been buying them for at least 5 years.Sad-Sad sign of the times",5
B0735T525V,Comfortable.,5
B0735T525V,"Just right: size and comfort. A pleasure to wear, especially with boots.",5
B0735T525V,"I was expecting these to be a little heavier, but they are good socks.  They are comfortable have plenty of s-t-r-e-t-c-h , and are holding up very well. They have been through several washes already and are still feeling like brand new socks. They keep my feet warm during the colder months, but yet are breathable so your feet don't sweat. Elastic hold up well to keep your socks exactly the way you like to wear them.",4
B0735T525V,Athletic use last about 3 months while casual is about 1 year. Still pretty decent life,5
B0735T525V,"The socks are good, but not very premium.  I hoped that they would have been thicker and that they had more cotton content.  They are nice, but not as good or as thick as I was hoping for.  Overall they are a good value.",4
B0735T525V,These are some of the most comfortable socks I've ever worn. I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact 2 socks have holes in them after just 2 weeks of wear.,4
B0735T525V,These socks are great. I am a bit on the heavy side and it's hard to find socks that don't dig into your legs after wearing all day. These socks stretch enough to avoid that. I am so grateful for finding these...,5
B0735T525V,"I wear these with my work boots.  They are comfortable and they don't slide down my legs, but some of them already have holes in their heels from normal wear... kinda disappointed about that.",4
B0735T525V,I have ordered these before for work. I wear them every day above 20 degrees.,5
B0735T525V,"These are soft, long, amazing and get the job done for what I need them to do in the gym BUT I took a second pair out to use and one of them had a hole in the leg portion of the sock. Other wise, 9/10 recommend",4
B0735T525V,These socks are not as thick as I thought they would be. Great price for the ten pair of socks.,3
B0735T525V,I like them.  Would buy again,4
B0735T525V,"The socks have left large amounts of lint on my feet, even though I have washed them 3 times. The calf material has holes in it after only one wash. The material is very thin.",2
B0735T525V,"Not sure what I was expecting but when it first came it looked huge, it fits true to size but looks huge. Very comfortable too!",4
B0735T525V,Not a good wuality and more an anklet than s crew,2
B0735T525V,Purchased for my husband and he finds them comfortable,4
B0735T525V,"These were my first boot sock purchase. For someone like me who has to wear a high, supportive boot due to a bad foot, these are great for the daily grind. They are a bit thinner then I would have liked - I would not recommend them for someone on their feet all day, every day. For the price, I am overall happy with them as I had reasonable expectations. If you need a pair of work socks that will be hit hard every day, I would suggest you look elsewhere.",4
B0735T525V,My only grievance is that after washing these inside out they still leave black lint on my feet at the end of the day.,4
B0735T525V,"I really liked the heeled socks with the thick grey underfoot part, but when I tried to ""Buy Again"", I ended up with some 18-inch tube socks. I'm not mad, really. Socks are socks, but I wasn't trying to have mismatched socks in my drawer.",5
B0735T525V,"First,company was great.timely delivery. Well made,hasn't walked through the heels of these socks.the old man puts socks on very tight and snug on toes.always walks holes in his socks.Not these though 2 years old now.ordering more,a must own sock.",5
B0735T525V,"These socks are super comfortable! For anyone wondering about the size, it's a size 6-12 for men. I typically wear a size 10 shoe for woman and these fit perfectly.",5
B0735T525V,Great for the value. No holes after a month and daily use. Only complaint is they have ALOT ALOT of lint that comes off on the inside of sock bottom on your foot. Definitely wash inside out before use.,4
B0735T525V,These socks were perfect fit for my husbands dress shoes,5
B0735T525V,"The socks are all pretty comfortable and fit me well, however they leave black lint every single time even after multiple washes. I have also noticed a few of them have popped seams at the top and also some are slightly different sizes. Still decent for the price.",3
B0735T525V,"Good deal on these, good for work boots, not the most comfortable or durable but I like changing them out frequently so they work for me.",4
B0735T525V,These were a gift; and the gentleman who received them said they were great!,5
B0735T525V,Great for work and keeping warm,4
B0735T525V,I always wear padded sole socks. Dickies so far is my favorite. Until I found these. The pouting is pretty awesome and the inside of the socks is softer than most of the thoughts I've worn.,5
B0735T525V,"These have been my go-to socks for many years now. They're fantastic for people who wear heavy work boots or military type boots on a regular basis, and they're just as comfortable to wear with tennis shoes on weekends.",5
B0735T525V,These sox where very thin not thick like the last fruit of the loom sox i bought at the store.,3
B0735T525V,These socks are definitely not steel toe socks. They barely have cushioning are kinda rough. Not super soft and thick like I was hoping for. You get what you pay for in this instance. Wish i could return them but I've already worn a couple pairs. I really need to learn to stop being cheap and just splurge for what I need,3
B07GSVDSF5,"This is a descent robe. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he liked it, so that's good. This is not a very thick robe. It has a tiny bit of plushness to it and a little bit of thickness, like, its not cheaply made thin if you know what im saying. It's a good quality fabric, but its not very thick fabric. So dont expect it to be luxury fabric when it comes to your door. It's very soft. My husband is 6'3 and it wasent too short for him and he said it keeps him warm. He liked the hood as well. So this was a good buy from Amazon I'd say. I make honest reviews to help others shop easier.",5
B07GSVDSF5,"It has been hard to find a nice robe for my husband. Normally he is an xl but he has large arms and legs because he does a lot of physical work. Ordered him 2xl-3xl and fits him perfectly. He likes the style, feel, and how warm it is. Good quality.",5
B07GSVDSF5,"It seems rather hard to find a nice robe today at a reasonable price.  This is a very nice, very comfortable robe that is also a reasonable price.  I'm a big guy, and I'm picky as all get out.  Great purchase.",5
B07GSVDSF5,This is very soft and luxurious. No one would believe the price. I am a Nordstrom customer and this looks very good for the price. My friend absolutely loves it.,5
B07GSVDSF5,I bought it for my husband for Valentine's Day because every night he says he's cold while we watch TV. I gave it to him early and he absolutely loves it. He says it's so soft and warm. It's comfortable too.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"If you're looking for a lounge robe this is it.  I've been wearing it everyday morning and night.  It's super soft and comfortable to lounge around in.  Not a ""bath"" robe imo, material isn't something I would use when wet but dry off well after a shower and lounge around it.  Feels like you're wearing a really soft blanket.  I love the hood and the placement of the belt loops keeps the tie with it and accessible.  Highly recommend!",5
B07GSVDSF5,Great soft plush material and size is perfect for my hubby,5
B07GSVDSF5,my husband loves this robe and barely takes it off.it's super fuzzy and warm and the quality is great. I've only washed it a handful of times but it's held up great.,5
B07GSVDSF5,Very comfortable. Super soft velour type material.  Had it for few weeks. Like it a lot.,5
B07GSVDSF5,Fits right nice feel!,4
B07GSVDSF5,Super soft and warm. Not super thick,4
B07GSVDSF5,Very soft and roomy,4
B07GSVDSF5,Thank you for quick shipping. Item is perfect!,5
B07GSVDSF5,I love this robe,5
B07GSVDSF5,Soft and warm snuggling,5
B07GSVDSF5,Ok,5
B07GSVDSF5,This thing is so damn soft and comfortable and keeps me nice and warm.I like bug bait.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Great fit, vacuum sealed for protection.",5
B07GSVDSF5,Very good product,5
B07GSVDSF5,So soft and so warm my wife and I both got one,5
B07GSVDSF5,"My wife loves this rob, usually during the winter. Keeps you warm. I'd recommend to all Rob loving couple.",5
B07GSVDSF5,"Long, soft, and he loves it! I was happy to see that it came down to his mid-calf!",5
B07GSVDSF5,5 years old and still like new. It has held up very well with numerous washings.  Fits nicely.  Awesome!!,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Brought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I think Im gonna get one for myself - he is tall and I ordered the S/M and it comes down to mid shin, very soft, hooded and has pockets. Couldnt ask for more!",5
B07GSVDSF5,Great product,5
B07GSVDSF5,my son loves this soft and comfy hooded robe,5
B07GSVDSF5,"I got this for my boyfriend, he never had one before.. he wears this religiously!! Huge bonus with the hood",5
B07GSVDSF5,Got this for my college kid and even though he is home right now he's wears it to just lounge in. And now my 16 year old wants one. Guess I'll be buying another! Size fit him perfect. He is 5ft 7 and weighs about 190.,5
B07GSVDSF5,Good quality but I wish I would have bought a cotton/terry cloth.,4
B07GSVDSF5,"I'm 6 foot.  I measured myself and thought this robe would come close to my ankles.  It comes just under the knee.  And it isn't very thick.  Good summer robe, but not useful in the winter.  Looks nice though.",4
B07GSVDSF5,I think the item is very soft very comfortable. Great to look at. I wear it after a shower or when I go into the spa and cold weather.,4
B07GSVDSF5,Comfortable and fits well,5
B07GSVDSF5,This is a great robe for relaxing and staying comfortable and warm in the winter time.,5
B07GSVDSF5,Material/fabric is super soft and comfy to be worn directly after taking a shower. But not entirely sure of its water retention capabilities.,5
B07GSVDSF5,The most comfortable one!Not changing a bit after many washes,5
B07GSVDSF5,My son loves this robe.  Not too heavy and extremely comfortable  He has put it on in the evening since Christmas.  Loves it.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"I bought this as a gift for my sons best friend, my sort of ""bonus kid"". He always wanted a ""Jedi"" robe with a big hood. When it arrived, the first thing I did was to check how generous the hood was. lolThe whole robe is beautiful. It is thick, plush and ever-so-soft. And the hood is really large and generous. Certainly fits ones head with ease and on me, comes down over my eyes, its so deep.Feels very luxurious! I'm so happy with my purchase and cant wait to gift it. :-)",5
B07GSVDSF5,Very soft and was exactly what I was expecting.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Great fit, nice quality",4
B07GSVDSF5,"Love it! Perfect for this time of year,  for ""lounging"" in the evening.",5
B07GSVDSF5,Excellent,5
B07GSVDSF5,"I bought this for my Son , it 3X fits Perfect,  very soft ! He loves the hood !nice big pockets",5
B07GSVDSF5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! Super soft and warm!,5
B07GSVDSF5,Exc,5
B07GSVDSF5,"I was very disappointed with the delivery service of the robe. It had been left at tge gate of the receiver's time, a quarter mile from his residence.The product was delivered to his home by someone in the neighborhood, not the delivery driver ( see last comment about this product).The receiver of the robe is enjoying the warmth of the robe now! GREAT FIT!",5
B07GSVDSF5,Gift for son he wears it every chance he can .Fit him well. He wears it like James Bond walking around.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"So soft and plushy and warm, all the things I expected it to be",5
B07GSVDSF5,very warm annn comfyyy...,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Came vacuumed in a bag. Don't be fooled it is a light/medium weight, yet warm robe. As with anything that touches the skin. It should be laundered before wearing.  I have had nicer robes.  Not in this price category. I would purchase again.",4
B07GSVDSF5,My grandson likes it.,4
B07GSVDSF5,This robe is very comfortable and it fits me perfectly. I even like the color and the look of it.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Soft, warm, comfortable robe. Nice quality",5
B07GSVDSF5,"The robe was a good fit and soft, but the material could be thicker/more plush. Love that it has a hood.",4
B07GSVDSF5,"Size runs a little small, so buy at least one size larger!!",4
B07GSVDSF5,"very comfortable, very warm and so soft",5
B07GSVDSF5,this is soft and warm well made i probably should have bought one size largerit has an inside tie and a belt to help keep closed,4
B07GSVDSF5,"Really nice robe, I do wish it was a little thicker but the material is so soft and im happy with the purchase.",4
B07GSVDSF5,"Love this robe, however two things are flawed.  First the belts stitching is coming undone after a week or so of wearing which is a little disappointing.  Secondly, and this is more personal preference, the belt loops are a little higher than I'd like.Otherwise the robe keeps me at the right temp, washing didnt seem to leave any pelting, and it's incredibly soft.",4
B07GSVDSF5,It was a gift. Extremely well liked both color and texture,5
B07GSVDSF5,My husband loves how soft and warm it is. True to size.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Friend loved this robe for it's softness, length, and unique color. Thank you, for such a good time product!!",5
B07GSVDSF5,"Fit, feel, price, quality.",5
B07GSVDSF5,Thick and warm. Perfect for the hubby,5
B07GSVDSF5,My husband loves it! Very cozy,5
B07GSVDSF5,Love this!!,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Bought this as a surprise, and my boyfriend couldn't stay away from it. He wore it almost daily and brought it everywhere with him. It looks really good on him too. The pictures don't do it justice.I'm returning to by another because he was soooo sad when he lost it.",5
B07GSVDSF5,"Very soft, beautiful robe. The person I bought it for loves it.  If you like to wrap the front around more, you may want to order the next size bigger. However, it does close with some overlap in his actual size.",5
B07GSVDSF5,Nice and warm,4
B07GSVDSF5,"The first one I ordered arrived perfectly, the second one took a lot longer to get here and had a hole in the hoodie. Good quality, warm, and had pockets. Also the largest one does not make it that much taller but gives you more in the sides to fold.",4
B07GSVDSF5,Just fine very comfortable everything is good,5
B07GSVDSF5,Great robe! My boyfriend loves it!,5
B07GSVDSF5,"Buena calidad, los colores son como aparecen en la foto se las recomiendo",5
B07GSVDSF5,Just what they advertised and just what I wanted,5
B07GSVDSF5,They loved them,5
B07GSVDSF5,very nice,4
B07GSVDSF5,Was pleased.  Could have been a little thicker but was warm.,4
B07GSVDSF5,"nice quality, warm",4
B07GSVDSF5,Comfy and warm robe. Stylish and roomy as I ordered a size up.,5
B07GSVDSF5,Comfort and washabiity.,5
B07GSVDSF5,"I used this product for a gift. And they loved it so much. The quality, warmth, size is perfect.",5
B07GSVDSF5,Loved the softness.  Also love the length and warmth. The pockets and hood are an extra bon to my son.  He just loves it.,5
B07GSVDSF5,Very luxurious.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Extraordinarily comfortable! Not too warm or too cold. Seems durable but I will check back after some use.,5
B08MBFY2VH,There's a reason they've been around so long.They fit how they should.They're comfortable and breathable.They have decent longevity.They're a go-to standard in separating your foot from surfaces.,4
B08MBFY2VH,"I wanted new ankle socks for my exercise workouts, and bought low ankle ones.  After a few washes they would slide down and off my foot. The ankle was too low and were too loose.  I decided on Hanes, with a bit taller top  and excellent quality and just the right height.",5
B08MBFY2VH,Socks are fairly cheap and fit great. Very comfortable. I would definitely recommend!,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Very comfortable. Low cut and fit nice. I wear a size 10"" shoe.",5
B08MBFY2VH,I have worn Haines socks all my life. Very comfortable and durable. Great product for the money.,5
B08MBFY2VH,They work great and are super comfortable!,5
B08MBFY2VH,I like the fit and thicknesses of sock,5
B08MBFY2VH,Good quantity and very comfortable. Great value for the price.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Soft and comfortable for all day standing at work,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Took multiple brands, but these don't make my feet feel itchy, and I can wear these with shoes and not look like a dork!",5
B08MBFY2VH,These are pretty good footies. They could use being as thick as they used to be. That is my only complaint.,4
B08MBFY2VH,Very good quality and a perfect fit.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Excellent socks.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Just simple socks!  Exactly what I wanted. Would buy again,5
B08MBFY2VH,Good,4
B08MBFY2VH,My son says these socks are very comfortable.,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Comfortable socks, fast shipping",5
B08MBFY2VH,"love these, perfect fit. great price too",5
B08MBFY2VH,Warm. Nice socks,5
B08MBFY2VH,Comfortable and breathable for all day wear!,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Before these I had burnt through numerous pairs of Walmart socks, rubbing holes in them at the ball of my feet and at my toes. these have lasted three times as long and are still going strong definitely a good value for the money. Great fit. Keep my feet dry so they are fairly moisture waking. I've washed them numerous times And so far I haven't had a problem with their washability.",5
B08MBFY2VH,"Socks came quickly, definitely a little thicker than I was expecting. Being ankle socks, the cut is a little high but they work well!",4
B08MBFY2VH,"Great quality.. very comfy, a bit thick, but breathable.. can get a bit warm though.",5
B08MBFY2VH,"These are the socks I rock on the daily. Comfortable, thick enough to not feel cheap but not so thick they suffocate my feet. Only giving 4 starts rather than 5 because they don't seem to survive the washing machine more than a dozen times or so before they start tearing.",4
B08MBFY2VH,Perfect for what I needed,5
B08MBFY2VH,socks fit well but you have lots of link in between your toes even after multiple washings.,4
B08MBFY2VH,Good quality and I like them because they are not 100% synthetic witch creates bad odor. Washed couple times looks almost the same.,4
B08MBFY2VH,"These are very soft socks, and a good value..",5
B08MBFY2VH,"My husband has a lawncare business here in florida and so socks don't stand a chance against his sweaty, grass stained, stanky feet lol. These have lasted the longest! Honestly, I was surprised at how well these have stood up to so much washing. Will definitely purchase more!",5
B08MBFY2VH,Feel comfortable.,5
B08MBFY2VH,"I never, never,.in my life will find socks that not get wet easily, they are comfortable, sweet free, refreshing(No heat on your feet), they seem to repel water unless you but them on a washing machine, but they dry fast too, maybe that's why it repels water, INK, but they are awesome.",5
B08MBFY2VH,Goodo,5
B08MBFY2VH,"I love the look of these socks.  I'm not sure about the seam near the toes, as it does seem to irritate after a while if you're wearing footwear.  I normally don't wear footwear around my house so I find the socks to be comfortable and warm.",5
B08MBFY2VH,The only socks I wear now.  Super comfortable.  Thick enough to stand up to some wear and tear.,5
B08MBFY2VH,I just received package no issues regarding this delivery thanks,4
B08MBFY2VH,"Love these socks, nice comfortable and very goodcushioning, breathable. Hands-down, one of my best purchases.",5
B08MBFY2VH,Soft and well insulated as basic cotton socks go. Durability TBD.,5
B08MBFY2VH,You cannot go wrong for the price and quality construction and durability of these socks. Great for PT and especially for running. Highly recommend for the Army folks out there.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Good work socks.,4
B08MBFY2VH,Best Buy and these socks are not to heavy not to thin. Just perfect and a Great Buy,5
B08MBFY2VH,"No real complaints, but they are very warm on the feet.",4
B08MBFY2VH,I've never had socks leave lint when drying.  My filter is covered with black lint (even after several washings).  On the positive note.  They fit well.  They're comfortable.,4
B08MBFY2VH,Nice and comfy.,5
B08MBFY2VH,"These socks feel so comfy and thick on my tootsies. They seem very well made, and they have a lot of nice cushion on the bottoms. I'm really happy with these and this purchase. Thank you.",5
B08MBFY2VH,a little thinner than I had imagined but they are fine for this summer heat,4
B08MBFY2VH,Some slipping and I think I prefer thicker socks.,3
B08MBFY2VH,"I've ordered other pants and every so often the advertised size isn't correct,but these were spot on , I'll be ordering more.",5
B08MBFY2VH,"They are socks and do what they say they do. Nothing special about them and they do feel fine. If your near the higher end of the state's size range ,I would go up to the next size as I wear a size 11 and although they fit,they are a little on the smaller size. Overall they are fine though and a trusted brand.",4
B08MBFY2VH,Very comfortable and by far my favorite socks.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Good fit,5
B08MBFY2VH,Nice socks for the value. Good quality. Comfortable and the elastic seems to be durable.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Thick and comfortable  socks.,5
B08MBFY2VH,"These ankle socks are terrific.  We'll made and should last for many uses.  Slightly thicker than my current Fruit of the Loom favorites they are a great value.  Fits my size 12 foot with ease.  Recommended, one of the best at this price.",5
B08MBFY2VH,"Nice fit, very comfortable",5
B08MBFY2VH,They fit.,4
B08MBFY2VH,My son needed short black socks for marching band. These are cushioned and wick away - no complaints.,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Please be aware these are not true ankle socks you know these are gonna come up above your ankles now I hate to the look of socks. And during the summer I usually wear basketball shoes with their higher ankle like a high top. So I generally chopped the top of these off anyway and kind of wear like a little booty lolVery spongy very absorbent, best on the market",5
B08MBFY2VH,"Playing golf in South Carolina in the summer means that you tend to mess many pairs of socks because of the sweat. These last as well as any others, they are comfortable and such great value that when they cannot answer the bell anymore you can just throw them out and buy new ones.",5
B08MBFY2VH,Sock was exactly what I was looking for great comfort and fit.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Price was fantastic,5
B08MBFY2VH,As described,4
B08MBFY2VH,"These lasted for 1.4 years before I started to notice the holes.  I liked to use these at work, I needed my socks to be really supportive and they did the job.  40 hours a week, so pretty frequently.  For $11, that is really niceCold water in washer, warm dry setting in dryer was my caretaking for these",5
B08MBFY2VH,"Unpleasantly surprised by these... Better quality, Thicker than I thought.  Extremely pleased with them",5
B08MBFY2VH,i really like how comfortable the socks are. im sticking to this brand and design of sock,5
B08MBFY2VH,Good fit and look good,5
B08MBFY2VH,"These socks fit great. They are comfortable, durable, and cushion.",5
B08MBFY2VH,At first seem small . But after you get them.on they are perfect soft and hold up well after many washes. Am buying more for hubby!,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Fit perfectly, great quality!",5
B08MBFY2VH,I had to cut these socks at the ankle to be able to wear them.,4
B08MBFY2VH,"Comfy socks, good for working in the yard with as grass/dirt stains dont show up on black! hahah. I'm a shoe size 9 and these socks fit perfectly.",4
B08MBFY2VH,good product,5
B08MBFY2VH,"I got these for my husband and he said they felt a bit tight on his 10.5 feet. He then pulled out a pair he bought a year ago, also Hanes brand, and compared them; the new (smaller) ones are on top = Product Shrinkage? (It's Everywhere! IT'S EVERYWHERE!!!)",3
B08MBFY2VH,Good socks.  They're tall enough for high top sneakers.,4
B08MBFY2VH,"I recommend these, these are very comfortable on my feet and fit great",5
B08MBFY2VH,Been looking to replace my socks as most of them were thin and had developed holes in the sole and this are nice and comfy. Pretty sure with the thickness they will last more than the 6 months that the last brand did as they've been holding up well to the metal chips at work. Elasticity is great and keeps them nice and tight on my feet and with black being my favorite color I feel I picked the right fit,4
B08MBFY2VH,I needed a lot of summer socks and I bought them and then wore them.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Fast delivery .. great quality .. not available in outlet store near us!,5
B08MBFY2VH,Nice comfortable affordable socks but got holes in them within a month of just wearing them around the house and on walks,3
B08MBFY2VH,They are comfortable socks but lasted only a few wears before developing holes behind the toe seam / or between the body of the sock and the toe .. not sure why that area is see through and thinner than the rest of the sock with zigzag threading /\/\/\/\ in one of the weakest areas of socks ..not worth buying unless you like holey socks,3
B08MBFY2VH,"its like Christmas at my moms, new socks! i love new socks and these fit the bill, I always buy the same ones so i don't have to find matches! these are super comfortable and perfect height for hi tops without being too hot!",5
B08MBFY2VH,Finally broke down and purchased these name brand socks. Look good and fit like a dream.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Nice,5
B08MBFY2VH,"Socks,  comfy",5
B08MBFY2VH,Very good quality,5
B08MBFY2VH,These ankle socks are great and feel real good when walking in them.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Bought these on prime day. Great deal and good value. Very comfy.,5
B08MBFY2VH,Great socks,5
B08MBFY2VH,"my husband likes the feel, his feet are comfortable in his shoes",5
B08MBFY2VH,These are a very nice thick cushioned sock. They still had a nice thick feel even after washing and drying. Fit was nice not too tight or loose.,5
B08LNZQW3R,I ordered a size medium for my smaller framed 15 year old. He typically wears a size 29 x 30 in jeans & the medium fit well. They are stretchy & fit snug. There is extra room left in the length. They are fleece lined. He said they are warm & comfortable.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Bought these to get in a few extra late and early season motorcycle rides. Also when I need an extra layer for winter activities when it's really cold out.On motorcycles , street and MX, I've been on the bike in temps as low as 45F and with these as a base layer I never felt too cold. Can still get chilly at highway speeds on a sport bike but nothing uncomfortable, on a dirt bike I'll even end sweating a fair bit.My wife talked me into doing a few 5ks this fall/winter too, over winter it was low 30s (way colder than I like) for a few and they kept my legs plenty warm.They are very tight even on my skinny legs though. To the point it made movement a little more difficult on motorcycles and I wonder if it affected my runs (I'm not a good runner to begin with though) I know they're compression fight and advertised as second skin fit, but I have heatgear compression fit leggings and shorts too and while they're definitely a tight second skin feel they aren't nearly as strong. After a few minutes you forget the heatgear are on, these are always squeezing pretty noticeably. Next fall I'll probably try getting a new pair in a size or two up from these.",5
B08LNZQW3R,"Tight compression , warm, make sure you know your size because Im in the large size range and it fits tight. Great UA design.",5
B08LNZQW3R,"Previously owned a pair of these same leggings for over 10 years. They seemed to have disappeared during a move so I wanted to replace them and these are not as warm as the previous pair I owned. Otherwise they fit great, just not as warm as they used to be.",4
B08LNZQW3R,Warm and cozy. My favorite pants to wear to bed. Amazing fit and quality,5
B08LNZQW3R,During the cold NY winter these will work to keep you warm. I'm outdoors for at least 2-3 hours during the winter and these work so damn well. I won't leave my apartment unless I've got a pair of these on.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Still wear them til this day. Just make sure you order the right size. Great if you want UA branded compressions but you can get something cheaper if you don't care about the brand name.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"I've been running for more than 35 years, but running in the cold (by which, as a Southerner, I mean anything below, say, 45 degrees) always has made me miserable. Guys my age don't look great in tights, but I finally surrendered and went with Under Armour because of price and name. Wow! What a difference these make, even if my wife did laugh at how I look. I might get another pair soon, if these survive the washing machine. SIZE NOTE: I'm 5-9 1/2 and 160 pounds and the large is just about perfect. Might be an inch too long, but at least there's no skin gap above my shoes.",5
B08LNZQW3R,My son has been using these for a while now at his sports practices and games when it is cold out. They are amazing at ensuring she is not cold when the temp is in the 30s and 40s.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Wore these as a base layer skiing in 10 degree weather, great balance between warmth and lightweight. Very impressed.",4
B08LNZQW3R,Love it.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"I bought these as cold weather long underwear and that they are. They are also skin tight. They are, in my opinion, leggings similar to women's stretch tights. There is a side pocket cell phone holder that has no value to me. The leggings have no fly which is a bit of a drag outside in cold weather work. They are good, well made leggings that I will use. They just weren't what I thought I was buying.",4
B08LNZQW3R,The XXL size was perfect for me. Weight 210 pounds but I have skinny legs.Original product and very happy.,4
B08LNZQW3R,Love em warm and soft amazing,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Nothing necessarily wrong with them but they do like to bunch up around your calves when putting them on and because they're so stretchy you have to get down there and really work them up onto your legs and then adjust them around a bit to get them right where you want them. I like them, though. I also have the matching mock turtleneck shirt. It's excellent and doesn't have the problems the leggings do. Both are very warm and comfortable and aren't grabby on your clothes when you move around.",4
B08LNZQW3R,Comfortable,5
B08LNZQW3R,I like them but I should have ordered a Size bigger.,5
B08LNZQW3R,just tried them. 34 degrees out on my bike ride. Worked greatunder my sweat pants.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"The material, look, and quality of this product is something I like about it. But it also helps that you carefully select the fit. If you have previous under armour underwear you have an idea on what size to pick. This is compression so I naturally picked one size up.",4
B08LNZQW3R,"Keeps you warm. Not durable they ripped easy. It says under armor Mexico on tag, so might just be cheaper made than standard under armor",4
B08LNZQW3R,Great fit and thick material!,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Medium size is very well, the quality is perfect and thick enough to keep you warm. Definitely durable enough to last years, highly recommend.",5
B08LNZQW3R,Great!,5
B08LNZQW3R,"If your hunting fishing hiking camping, walking the dog , pick up sports games, even if you just wana stay inside and be warm. These are it. Wana stay warm out these under armor compression cold gear on and stay warm for the winter. Two thumbs up.",5
B08LNZQW3R,"I have multiple pairs of this item as well as thinner versions for warmer weather. I also have a selection of compression pants from other major athletic apparel companies stuffed in a backup gym bag in the closet.At this time, I exclusively purchase compression pants from UA. A few reasons, but primarily because of the high quality and the pocket that comes standard on the right leg (this pocket is not something I use every time I wear them, but when I do, it's a massive convenience).Honestly, I can't believe Nike, Adidas, or the niche running apparel brands have not incorporated a STANDARD pocket in all their compression pants. No doubt, you'll find other brands with pockets and I own some, but they're always marketed as specialty compression pants with a very special price.These are very good as compression pants. They last if cared for. They keep me warm in as low as mid-teens temps (Fahrenheit). They have the above-referenced pocket regardless of thickness, color, or option I choose. Zero reason to look at another brand for this particular product.",5
B08LNZQW3R,"These are warm, good texture, and very comfortable. Can stay warm and dry during soccer in cold weather. Only item of note is the ankle opening is tight. Had to order up a size after returning originals.",5
B08LNZQW3R,I wear under any of my pants and they keep me warm. I don't feel wind through them.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Could be better but works for the most part,3
B08LNZQW3R,Great product!  My son loves the product just wished it was less expensive.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Great fit and durable fabric. My wife likes how it is so form fitting too ha,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Warm, comfortable, and fit perfect.",5
B08LNZQW3R,Bought to wear in colder weather while running. Wear under some windproof nylon pants when below 50*. They do a decent job but are NOT for warmth if you are not ACTIVE. Very thin & compression leggings. My daughter said they appear as difficult as her putting on pantyhose! Have to pull up to knees then pull the material above knees up to keep them smooth & prevent bunching anywhere. It is a tedious process to get all the way to waist but work pretty well for me.,4
B08LNZQW3R,"The material is excellent, and is great at heating. My only complaint is that they were a bit tight around *certain areas*, and made wearing them a bit uncomfortable, despite the pants being my size. Good for working out in or beating the cold.",4
B08LNZQW3R,"I've used UA thermals for over 20 years, in Canada, across the US in the Rockies, Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and Alaska, as well as on the Bering Sea during the crab season. Always reliable and lasting. Finally needed a new pair, but disappointed. Very low quality compared to the original stuff, sizing is completely different, materials are all different, feels and works like any run of the mill crap from Walmart. Wouldn't buy again unless I see them in person first.",2
B08LNZQW3R,"I don't know how it's possible, maybe I'm just a freak or something or something to do with the compression but my legs are colder when wearing these than when I'm not wearing them (even when inside the house!), which defeats the entire purpose of why I bought these. The description says they're ""ultra-warm"" which is inaccurate in my opinion, it's like my legs are being actively cooled.",2
B08LNZQW3R,Excellent product,5
B08LNZQW3R,A,5
B08LNZQW3R,Bought the mediums for my husband! They fit good and are tight like expected! These pants keep him warm in the winter time when layered with pants or overalls!,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Good compression, great fit under uniform",5
B08LNZQW3R,"I owned a pair of Under Armour leggings from 10-15 years ago and they were amazing in all around weather (including very low temps). After some eventual tearing around the bottoms I decided on buying a new pair. I bought the WarmGear and ColdGear pairs. The ColdGear is amazing, and keeps my legs SUPER warm outside (including in the recent -2F temps), yet isn't hot while inside the gym. I highly recommend these. The WarmGear is equally as impressive but definitely cooler in cold temps than the ColdGear.Fit wise, I didn't want any bagginess. They needed to be snug. At 5'11"", the Large was the perfect length, and tightness. They were both a little baggy around my ankles, but after the first wash they were perfect!",5
B08LNZQW3R,Great base layer. Great fit. Exactly what you expect when you pay this much for this brand. No complaints except price. I could buy some more sets if I could afford them.,4
B08LNZQW3R,Same quality as what to expect from Underarmour.,4
B08LNZQW3R,Under Armour makes cold weather so much more tolerable! As I get older my body temperature get colder and these make such a big difference. Sizing chart is right on and the quality is excellent. The cost could be more affordable but you are paying for the name. I find them worth their money.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Long time user of several of these. Like them, that's why bought another. This generation has a few changes. The UA logo is moved from the calf to the front thigh. It is smaller, and unlike the calf logo - does not stretch. The calf logo was beautiful and carried the brand elegantly. This logo is tiny and unimposing.The groin area is differently cut/stitched; it does not sit as comfortably as my other ones. I am not a tailor, so my review is on ""feel"" only.The material is nice, warm - like my previous ones - as expected.",4
B08LNZQW3R,"Excellent cold weather baselayer ,perfect for all day sits in Temps from the 50's down through the 20's.. Excellent moisture management allowing your sweat to dissipate on the walk in so no you retain your body's heat more effectively.. An excellent choice for every hunters clothing arsenal..",5
B08LNZQW3R,"I see a lot of guys wear these at the gym.  Under shorts.  I have no idea why I bought these.  I put them on, and I just don't understand.  Why????????  Someone please enlighten me.Still, they are great quality.  They didn't rip apart as I rolled all over the floor getting them on.  Then I looked in the mirror, and saw my junk popping out . . . like . . WHY?Imagine I wear these . . and went to my see my family on Thanksgiving Dinner.  Imagine their faces!  And yet, I still bought them.",5
B08LNZQW3R,"The quality of these are great.  However, they run extremely small.  I ordered my son an adult small (which is his usual size and he has other Under Armour cold gear leggings this size that are a perfect fit), but they look and fit like a youth large.  We thought that maybe they would stretch, but when he tried them on, his movement was noticeably restricted.  He was so disappointed that I am returning them for an adult large (yes, they're that small).  Otherwise, they would be great.",4
B08LNZQW3R,"First time I wore them, it was 27 degrees. I only had on these and a pair of sweat pants to play pickleball. They were so cozy and warm, I kept them on most of the day to lounge in. I love these so much I had to get another pair.",5
B08LNZQW3R,These are by far my favorite outdoor leggings for cold weather running. They have enough material on them as well as a pocket where you wouldn't even need to wear shorts on top of them. They keep me warm and they keep compression on my legs so I can run far. I just ran a half marathon in them. Would definitely buy again.,5
B08LNZQW3R,I've been using Under Armour Cold Gear as a base layer for my security uniforms since I began my career back in 2013 but I've never purchased their leggings before. When I order these leggings I had no doubt that they would live up to my expectations of the Under Armour brand and they did not disappoint. The fit and finish is perfect. No loose threads or bad stitching to be found. I started out with one pair to make sure I'd be happy with them and quickly purchased a second pair a few weeks later. I definitely would recommend them.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Purchased these for hubby to attend a late fall outside event.  He tried them on and loved them so much would not take them off for a few days:). Had to purchase more pair so he would have a few pair.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"These are great for keeping warm during cold winter runs. I have had issues with durability with compression shorts and tights, but these seem to be holding up really well (potentially due to added thickness for warmth)",5
B08LNZQW3R,"I wear an XL which is what the chart says I should be.  I wish they came up a bit higher to help tuck everything in and keep things from riding up and riding down.  Otherwise, they feel like good quality.  Pocket is a nice touch if you're wearing a pocketless layer.  Only other thing is that there are like 6 big tags.  Seems unecessary.",4
B08LNZQW3R,I use these for running in the winter and they were a bit tighter and shorter relative to what I expected for a medium. They are also not very warm unless I am running otherwise they are borderline ineffective.,3
B08LNZQW3R,"I bought these for winters runs in Wisconsin but they didn't work out for me. They're surprisingly warm and seem to be very well made. But, there are seams on the inner thighs where the crotch gusset connects to the legs and these cause some serious chafing any time I do a run longer than 2 or 3 miles. I followed the fit guide to choose my size, but maybe I should have sized up. Hard to say if that would solve my problem and I'm already past the return window so I can't report back.",3
B08LNZQW3R,Fit as it should. Tested this past weekend. Kept me toasty at 32 degrees F.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Bought these for my husband to wear under his clothes when playing out in the snow. Kept him warm.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Item arrived a week later than the original delivery day. I waited a whole week to receive today and item that is the wrong size and has been used by someone. The item arrived not in the original package and the tags have been removed. It really sucks! I'm going snowboarding on Friday and I was planning on using it as a base layer. I need my money back asap. THIS ITEM IS TRASH!!!,1
B08LNZQW3R,Bought for the winter months. They did not disappoint. Kept me nice and warm.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Nice and warm fit like they should! True to size,5
B08LNZQW3R,5.8/175 normal body shape and the large was insanely tight.Not doable.Order two sizes up.,2
B08LNZQW3R,"The fit and compression of these are the best that I have had. The stitching from the elastic started to come loose with the first washing. They are the most comfortable ever, but I might have to get some replacements.",3
B08LNZQW3R,"These are the best cold-weather compression pants I have used for running in colder temps. Also great for laying on the coldest of days. High quality, and the XL was perfect for me at 6'3 185lbs",5
B08LNZQW3R,"Not very warm. like-they're alright I guess. That's my reaction. I don't know what it is with no one making actually warm things. Maybe every product wants to be versatile enough to use on normal days and cold days. Boo to that. If I buy something called ""cold front"" I want it to be warm enough to wear in the cold. Crazy idea I know. These seem like a 3 out of 10 on warmth. Personally, I would rather have one pair I can use on normal days and one solid pair I can use on really cold days rather than some one-product-sort-of-fits-all meh. Let me know when you come out with some Arctic level, made out of polar bear fur, stuff that I could wear in -40 and I'll be interested.",3
B08LNZQW3R,These leggings are very comfortable and super warm. Rode with them in colder weather as the only layer below on the legs and several layers on the upper body.,5
B08LNZQW3R,I bought it as I am preparing for a trip out of country (somewhere cold)I'm like how they fit but I really don't feel the warmth. Kinda feels l ike a regular legging for workouts.,3
B08LNZQW3R,"Not happy with these. Got a size, but way too tight. Need to go at least two sizes bigger!",3
B08LNZQW3R,I purchased previous Under Armour leggings but these ones fit me the best. I love the deep bold colour. The elastic in the waist is strong after several wearings. It has helped to fuel several of my workouts it is an amazing product and has not degraded at all after several months,5
B08LNZQW3R,"I bought these for heavy weight tights mid-winter in NYC.  They work.  But surprisingly, they still felt good in the late winter and I think I may not have worn my lightweight tights at all the reat of the year.  Comfortable and useful side pocket for keys, etc.",5
B08LNZQW3R,Material is of high quality and seems durable. I would have preferred that there would be a size chart.Even though am very skinny and short it seems kids size. Still I like it.,4
B08LNZQW3R,These are perfect for soccer / run and the New York cold,5
B08LNZQW3R,"Son said they were too big, hopefully he grow into them next year",3
B08LNZQW3R,I really enjoy the fit and warmth of these and am planning on purchasing additional pairs.,5
B08LNZQW3R,"these are way way way too tight. the sizing is wrong. if you normally take medium, purchase 4x. they pull up my legs, slide down my hips. they are uncomfortable, and frankly they are so tight that they cause me to become dizzy. these are ridiculous. overpriced and bad fit",1
B08LNZQW3R,Great fit and comfortable under work clothes in cold weather,5
B08LNZQW3R,I like the old-style long johns better,3
B08LNZQW3R,These fit just the same as the Under Armour pair I first ordered many years ago but they are warmer! The waistband has changed but it hasn't affected the fit. I wear these under bib shorts for biking on (California) cold days and they give me the warmth and coverage that I need.,5
B08LNZQW3R,Great for cold weather running.,5
B08LNZQW3R,I ordered these for my son. He plays travel soccer which means he plays all year long. He said that they fit perfectly. He said he is warm. The only thing that was cold was his hands but there is nothing the cold gear can do about that lol. I ordered him a mens medium he normally wears a mens small to a medium but I wanted him to have some room just in case he grows (he is 12) .,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"These socks fit and look great! They are light weight, snug fitting, and the cotton feels good. Much more cost effective than the big name brands.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,These socks are great!  I usually only buy socks when what I have are worn out because so many times the new ones are less than acceptable construction or wear out in a matter of weeks.  These are tough and comfortable and only come past your ankle.  If I don't get more for Christmas I'm going to buy some because invariably when I find clothing that is made sturdy and fits well it goes off the market pretty quickly.  You better hurry!  You'll be glad you did!,5
B07QN3C3QJ,These are well made socks and feel great on my feet.  About ankle height and the colors are just like the photo. I will buy again when needed.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"I like the way these socks are packed. Even more so, I like way they feel and fit. The material is thin but feels well-made and durable. They are super comfortable to wear.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,"I don't generally like sport/support socks as I find them to be too tight or confining - even though my shoe size (10) is on the low end of the typical 9-12 range offered.  For this reason, I often go for much lighter socks that don't last.  My wife bought these for me. When I saw them I thought, 'these are going to be too confining'.  I was wrong.  These are extremely comfortable and durable.  Best sport socks I've ever owned.  I'm going to buy extras just in case they're discontinued!",5
B07QN3C3QJ,"The high cotton content is a major plus for comfort as my primary use is as a ""not quite barefoot""  around the house sock or casual out and about sock.  The cotton content probably rules out their use as a sports sock for activities such as long runs or hikes but the incorporation of flush seams should help prevent abrasions or blisters for activities of shorter duration. Although not looking for a thick sock I would have liked a bit more cushioning in the soles and especially the heel but after washing and drying the cushioning did fluff up a bit as you might be able to see on the washed sock on the left (the pictures show both regular and inside out.)  As expected with the high cotton content you can see that they did shrink and being at a borderline11 3/4 shoe size I was very glad I went with the XL over the large that I would normally get in higher synthetic socks: if in doubt go larger. Even with the shrinkage they had a very nice fit and feel. A thumbs up and definitely recommended.",4
B07QN3C3QJ,"Okay, I get it. It's an ankle cut sports sock. This is the second time I've ordered them, the first was a couple years ago, and those are still in rotation.These last long, maintain form, and it's crazy, but they're cushioned in the right spots and thin in the right spots too. They have some general arch hug, which I love.Worth every penny, and honestly, it's not a lot pennies. Great value! Better than any Nike or Adidas socks I've ever bought.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Right out of the box, the material felt like quality material. Trying them on, they fit well and are very warm. I did have to take a star off as one sock did tear after the second time putting them on. I wish it could be a half star as I think there was something different in the feel of the fabric of that sock, but it is what it is. I will order another box in the future to further evaluate these socks, but other than the one issue, they are snug, comfortable, and warm.",4
B07QN3C3QJ,"To start, the socks hug my arch under my foot better than any other sock I have had in a long time. They are not as thick a sock as my last athletic socks I just bought from Amazon, not too long ago. These are a little bit shorter, and thinner. These are just over the ankle, not by much. They have just enough spandex in them, to keep them (elastic-tight enough) around my foot & ankle, that it's not annoying or uncomfortable. Unlike almost all cotton athletic socks I previously gotWhich I still wear from time to time, those socks are thicker & longer way higher over the ankle. NOT as elastic, they have more thick cotton, the sock slides all over my foot a little too much while in my shoes & sometimes the socks don't stay up on my legs. Just little annoying things.(not deal breakers) where I would throw them away like that....",4
B07QN3C3QJ,Personally I have a very difficult time finding sport socks that fit properly. I need a size that is just over the common one 9-12. I thought I would give these a try and I am very pleased. The fit is awesome and they are heavier than most which I desire for pickleball.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,My husband is picky on his socks but he says these are great! Lightweight and they material is is soft and stretchy.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Great quality really comfortable and great price love this socks,5
B07QN3C3QJ,The mostly cotton and Polyester/spandex blend is very comfortable. Not too bulky and glides nicely onto your foot,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Ordered XL for man with shoe size 13.  He stated the socks were too tight around his toes.,4
B07QN3C3QJ,"I bought these socks  for my son who wanted them to wear for running.  When he opened them, my other son liked them so much that he wanted them too.  Now they both plan to use them on a regular basis as they run daily.  These socks were packaged nicely, arrived quickly, and fit well.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Had never heard of the brand and took a punt. Good quality at a good price.,4
B07QN3C3QJ,Great lightweight socks.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Great socks,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"These are warm, great fit and comfortable.  As with all socks it would be better if the under heal did not wear out leaving the rest of sock in fine condition.  However,  I will be buying more.  Thank you...",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Will order more,5
B07QN3C3QJ,I like the comfort and feel of the socks,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Like, good quality.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Socks are very comfortable and provide good support to foot,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"These are comfortable and well-made socks. I was hoping to get a half-year's worth of wear at the price, but I was surprised that they held up. I'm very tough on my socks, which is why they earn 5 stars.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,My husband meant for me to order higher socks.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Great material fit perfectly,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Comfortable and affordable,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Boyfriend loves them!!!,5

B07QN3C3QJ,Very good,5
B07QN3C3QJ,It is very comfortable and recommended,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Work great, fast delivery!",5
B07QN3C3QJ,I ordered these as a Gift for my Brother. He wears Crocs all the time (because they're comfortable for his diabetic feet) and I didn't want socks too thick.He ABSOLUTELY LOVES these!!!,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Great quality and fit.  Very comfortable too.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"worked great, affordable, matched description, and delivered on time. would recommend",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Great size and breathable,5
B07QN3C3QJ,I wore a pair today and the felt great. They hugged my feet and worked well in my training shoes. I also liked the packaging.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Very comfortable fit just above the ankle..They seem to hold up well after a few washings. I ordered another box!,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Arrived on time. Stretch material is good (my son has wide feet). Great arch support! Will buy again.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"I liked the socks, bought them for me and my boyfriend, I like how they fit and not tight on me.",4
B07QN3C3QJ,I love these socks! Comfortable and reasonably sturdy. And right on time.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Thin but not too thin.  Fit the foot perfectly.Good value for your moneycould be slippery. I would wear shoes.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,These are great quality socks for a very reasonable price. I'm probably going to buy more of them.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,These are great socks. They are soft and supportive and much more affordable than some of the trendy no shows. I recommend you give them a try!,5
B07QN3C3QJ,These socks fit a wide size 12 foot perfectly. They fit great. I bought second box of 6. I threw out all of my other socks. They are very comfortable and well made,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Good value for nice warm socks!,4
B07QN3C3QJ,Will buy more,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Nice socks for the price,4
B07QN3C3QJ,Easy to put on and very comfortable...,4
B07QN3C3QJ,Lo esperado,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Fits perfectly. Comfortable, lightweight, good value for the price.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,The price and how well they fit my feet love the product so much I brought 12 more,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Quality product that fits correctly. XL is really XL I am a size 14 EE and these fit great. Highly recommend this product.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"These Sox are the perfect height and weight.  After wearing them only one day, my husband bought another package and keeps singing their virtues.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Super comfortable and fit well a little extra in the rite places,4
B07QN3C3QJ,They fit well and I really like the appearance of the sock near the top with a cool pattern weave. They are very comfortable.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"The only drawback, but a big one, is they constantly leave lint everywhere. No matter how many times you wash and wear them. Otherwise they would be perfect as described.",3
B07QN3C3QJ,Nice socks,4
B07QN3C3QJ,"Incredibly comfy socks. At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, they're the best ankle socks I've ever owned.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Good for wearing with any shoes , not  restrictive at all and has held up well after several washings.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,I like these socks but they get holes in them after a few months. I've bought them a few times now.,3
B07QN3C3QJ,My teenager loves the way these fit.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,I really like these new socks. I only feel comfy in short socks and these are great. Very comfortable.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Great socks. Easy to pull on.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,Nice cushion on bottom,3
B07QN3C3QJ,"fabric is cushioned but very breathable so your feet don't get too hot. they're soft and have stayed soft for many washes. sturdy and don't tear easily. the cushioning is so comfortable. amazing for the price, i'm buying two more packs.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Socks are good quality,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"This is the 2nd time I have purchased these socks. I have a smaller foot. Buying socks that ""fit all"" leave 1/2"" of open sock around my toes. I don't like that at all. These socks fit great, are very soft & comfortable and they wear great also!",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Ankle part is higher than it looks in the photo. Will only be able to wear these with jeans/pants. Not shorts.,4
B07QN3C3QJ,These socks are way too thin for jogging. Not impressed.,3
B07QN3C3QJ,bought these did not think they were that it great. big mistake they are super and price is great.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,I'm quite happy with the quality of these socks. They are right about the thickness all a round. I wear these in running shoes as well as my high top steel toe boots. I would recommend these for any one looking for breathable athletic socks,4
B07QN3C3QJ,"Hi( Written By Kim's Dad )I have a size 13-14 foot. When opening and first looking at the socks I could tell immediately the socks where under sized and not a size 12-15. Tried one sock on found it to be way to small, its more like a size 9 - 12 SMALL.The quality of the socks are 5 Star!If they were truly a size 12-15 I would have kept them. Get them, but knowing they run small.Thanks.",4
B07QN3C3QJ,"Fit is great, comfortable, breathable, not too thin or bulky. Great for exercise, running etc. recommend.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,very comfortable,5
B07QN3C3QJ,They look and feel great,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Excellent quality of this socks, excellent customer service.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,"I ALWAYS need to size up, so these probably fit about how people expect?  I wear size 9W women's shoe and got the 9-11 size which is meant to fit feet that are 2-4 sizes bigger than mine.. They fit perfect, feel nice. Not sure about durability yet, but should last okay if you wear them with shoes.",4
B07QN3C3QJ,The socks are comfortable and met  my expectations I rate the product highly.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,I love these socks. I have been wearing them for years and they are the only socks I buy/wear anymore. They are very soft and comfortable without being thick and hot. Also I have small feet so most men's socks don't fit so it's nice having socks that are actually the proper size.,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"Snug fit, cushiony, no friction, blister free.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,Roomy enough for my xxx size feet!,5
B07QN3C3QJ,"I came back and bought this brand 3 times,they have really good support and reinforcement in the toes and arches without any constriction(high percentage cotton to spandex ratio).Where the arches and heels are stretch where it counts,and if you wash the grey colored ones with bleach,they only fade to brown and are still very wearable w/poly-spandex retention.",5
B07QN3C3QJ,got these for biking and running and such. Great socks. Would buy again.,5
B06XWM4PWG,Fast shipping; arrived as promised; good fit and very comfortable,5
B06XWM4PWG,"I recently purchased the Amazon Essentials Men's V-Neck Undershirt, and I couldn't be more pleased with my decision. This pack of six black undershirts has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and comfort. The fabric is incredibly soft and breathable, making it perfect for daily wear or layering beneath a dress shirt.One of the standout features of these undershirts is their great quality. They feel durable, yet lightweight, ensuring they hold up well in the wash while maintaining their shape and color. The v-neck design is stylish and versatile, allowing for a comfortable fit without compromising on appearance.I've worn these undershirts multiple times, and they continue to deliver on comfort and style. Plus, the value of getting six in a pack is outstanding! Whether you're looking for everyday wear or a reliable undershirt for a special occasion, I highly recommend the Amazon Essentials Men's V-Neck Undershirt. You won't be disappointed!",5
B06XWM4PWG,"I got these to wear under my nasty polyester work shirts and they make a really nice, comfortable barrier.",5
B06XWM4PWG,"Theses new Amazon Essentials are not as good of quality as the older ones. The t shirt on the left is the new shirt right out of the bag. The T shirt on the right is the older T shirt over a year old and washed many times. The old shirt was made in Vietnam and the new shirt made in Pakistan. If you hold the new shirt up, you can see through is. It is a very thin rough cotton. The shirt on the right is opaque and is smooth and had a small amount of shrinkage in washing. The new t shirt that I am wearing now after one day of wear and then washing has shrunk significantly. Where the old shirt maybe lost half a size the new shirt has lost about a size and a half. It is also shorter by about 2inches than the old one when new. So after washing, the new shirt barely covers my waist and is much tighter. Apparently Amazon found a cheaper supplier in Pakistan and went with them. I expect you would have to order a size or 2 over what you would normally order and figure they will last about 3 months or so before being too thin and getting holes. The will make descent dust or work rags.",3
B06XWM4PWG,"My husband's favorite undershirts!! Soft, stretchy, super comfortable. Highly recommend.",5
B06XWM4PWG,I've been shopping with this seller for awhile. I like the affordable prices. I'm nit a fan of v neck but my kids like the shirts,4
B06XWM4PWG,These are greatComfy and fit in the rangeGo ahead get a packageYou will not be disapointed,4
B06XWM4PWG,comfort best fit quality,5
B06XWM4PWG,Excelente producto buen material,5
B06XWM4PWG,i really like like the material. It is not thin/see through. No tag. Very comfortable. I just purchase the black because it never seems to be available. Looking forward to receiving them. It's my third purchase.,5
B06XWM4PWG,Perfect!,5
B06XWM4PWG,This is a well made shirt at a reasonable price. I would recommend them to others.,5
B06XWM4PWG,"Good price , perfect fit,",4
B06XWM4PWG,"Nice but a little thinner than I expected, maybe my expectation problem. All in all I am satisfied!",4
B06XWM4PWG,"Good quality, fit well, use underneath shirts",4
B06XWM4PWG,"My husband's usual size medium fit well, if slightly loose even after washing. He likes the material; says the quality is better than other budget brands.",4
B06XWM4PWG,They were thinner than I hoped.,4
B06XWM4PWG,"Undershirts, a seemingly simple garment, play a crucial role in elevating the comfort of everyday wear. A well-designed undershirt can make a significant difference, and brands like Hanes or Calvin Klein consistently deliver in this regard. The softness of the fabric and the snug fit add a layer of coziness under clothing, preventing irritation and ensuring a smooth feel against the skin. These undershirts often come in various styles, from crew necks to V-necks, allowing for versatility in wardrobe choices.The breathability of quality undershirts is another notable feature, providing a cool and ventilated layer that helps manage body temperature throughout the day. Whether worn under a dress shirt or a casual top, a good undershirt absorbs perspiration, keeping outer garments fresher for longer periods. Moreover, the durability of materials used in these undershirts ensures they withstand regular washing and maintain their shape, offering long-lasting comfort. Undershirts are an often-overlooked essential that, when chosen wisely, can significantly enhance the overall comfort and longevity of one's clothing collection.",4
B06XWM4PWG,"I like these shirts a lot and have ordered more. They fit true and seem to be great quality. They do shrink more than other shirts such as Gildan, but  still worth it.",4
B06XWM4PWG,2X t shirt the shrunk now a 1X.  Be aware of shrinking if a 2 X order a 3X.,3
B06XWM4PWG,"Out of the packaging, these shirts are a little longer than Id like, but after washing/drying they fit perfectly as an undershirt.",4
B06XWM4PWG,The part around neck expands too much over time and it looks funny. Maybe I expected it to last too long. If you need towels for car washing every couple of months it is a good purchase.,3
B06XWM4PWG,NICE FIT,5
B06XWM4PWG,"I NEEDED PLAIN SHIRTS TO WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE IN SUMMER/FALL AND I LIKE DARK COLORS. THESE WORKED PERFECTLY FOR THAT. I'M PHYSICALLY DISABLED SO I DON'T NEED TO CHANGE SHIRTS EVERY DAY. SO ONCE EVERY 3-DAYS I CHANGE SHIRTS AND ONLY NEED TO DO LAUNDRY ONCE A MONTH. BEING BLACK THEY DO PICK UP EVERY BIT OF WHITE DUST, TISSUE LEFT IN A PANTS POCKET IN THE WASHER, & FABRIC ""BUNNIES"". BUT I EXPECTED THAT. I'M ALONE IN THE HOUSE, SO THAT'S NO ISSUE FOR ME. VERY PLEASED WITH THESE OVERALL.",5
B06XWM4PWG,Best bang for your buck.,5
B06XWM4PWG,Fabric is soft but hem is way too short.,3
B06XWM4PWG,"These are lightweight undershirts with the versatility to wear them alone or under other shirts. The material is soft, but easily stretches out & loses its shape. The black is stylish & easy to pair with any outfit. For the number of shirts you get for such a low price, they're worth it. I can never have too many lounge tshirts!",4
B06XWM4PWG,"Used for undershiry, Medium was not too tight and reasonably soft, So far a couple has been washed and dried with no shrinkage. Being tagless is a big plus for me",4
B06XWM4PWG,The length of the t shirt a little short.,3
B06XWM4PWG,Purchased these tshirts for my grandson to imprint designs. They worked out very well,5
B06XWM4PWG,"I really like these tshirts. They are extremely soft, comfortable, and easy to put on. I also like that they also hold up after being through the washer a few times. I recommend!",5
B06XWM4PWG,"I got exactly what I expected. This isn't a Versace tee or an ultra-light stretch fabric; it's a t-shirt--no more and no less.The material is a little heavier than other undershirts I own and a little stiff, but still comfortable. It's comparable to the types of shirts that companies normally hand out at convention booths.If anything, the sizes were a little large. I buy small undershirts so they're tight, but these are probably closer to a medium in other brands.That said for the price, I have no real complaints. They've held up well over several months and are comfortable. What more could I expect?",4
B06XWM4PWG,Nice cotton.,5
B06XWM4PWG,"Great value at a great price.  They are soft and very comfortable.  They are not as long as others I have bought before but for the price they are worth it.  The V neck is not as deep, overall I am happy with my purchase.",4
B06XWM4PWG,A good value if you get  larger than need size. These t-shirts shrink a least one full size after two washings.,3
B06XWM4PWG,"I bought the XL size Tees and they fit hubs, but one size bigger would have been better.  He's not very big so I think these shirts are Asian sized instead of American sized.  Other than that they're very good.  Hubs wears them under his uniform work shirt where the rules state that tees can't be seen so the V neck doesn't show.  The black is very black and the material is nice and soft.",4
B06XWM4PWG,nice t shirts good price,5
B06XWM4PWG,These are very nice and the size was accurate good quality and good cotton l will buy these from now on as l got fed up trying to find my size from other vendors Thanks Amazon,5
B06XWM4PWG,"Excellent value here. They are not as sharp as some other brands, but I wear these constantly as they fit me right. They went up in price shortly after my first purchase but I still got another set for $23.99 when they got back in stock. If they continue to go up, I'll probably try other brands too.I wear these V neck shirts constantly and the most important part is how well the V neck is able to keep its edge after many washes. I always wash and dry on cold. I guess if I pressed the V neck it would keep better.",5
B06XWM4PWG,I am very surprised at the excellent quality these shirts are.  Way better than the Hanes under shirts I have previously gotten.  Will be purchasing again.,5
B06XWM4PWG,A bit smaller than other medium sized undershirts.,4
B06XWM4PWG,These are good for knock around t shirts. They are thinly made and shrink. My 2XL quickly became an XL after one wash and dry. Order a size up. I will order a 3XL next time. Great price,3
B06XWM4PWG,Size is good fitting and quality is very good . Far better than other suggested brands which looks good in photos but not in real .,5
B06XWM4PWG,"good shirts, sizes in the pack vary slightly. matters cause im tall, and like half the pack makes me feel like im wearing a long halter top. if its an undershirt situation, worth it. wearing around the house, worth it. wearing in public, seek the opinion of a trusted friend first.",4
B06XWM4PWG,"Great fitting, proper length undershirts.  UNTIL you wash them.  Followed wash and dry instructions.  Shirt length shrunk over 2""!",3
B06XWM4PWG,"These are heavier than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. A perfect weight for summer or winter. The quality is better, too. I've had these for a few months and they are holding up very well.",5
B06XWM4PWG,Love the quality and price.,5
B06XWM4PWG,I wear these every day,5
B06XWM4PWG,"The description said there were six tee shirts, the label on the package said six pieces, but there were only five shirts. The priduct is fine,  I was shorted one shirt.",3
B06XWM4PWG,"Really nice quality, comfy fit",5
B06XWM4PWG,I love they reasonable prices and quality,5
B06XWM4PWG,Nice cotton shirts.  Didn't shrink much after washing and drying.  Still fit nice.,5
B06XWM4PWG,"Vneck much more shallow than the big brand names I currently own. So this shirt shows more often when collecting a collared shirt over, compared to other brands. Not a fan of that, but not a deal breaker either. It is just thick enough to not be see through, so happy with that. All undershirts are overpriced now, but this is a better value than most",4
B06XWM4PWG,Have been using these for several months now and they are holding up as good as the more expensive ones with maybe the exception of them wrinkling a little more out of the dryer but not really an issue since I wear them under my shirts.,4
B06XWM4PWG,The price on these is fair.  They are thinner than the name brands.  They shrunk a little after the first wash.  A decent value for the money.,4
B06XWM4PWG,"We really liked these shirts when we first got them. They feel like a quality shirt. However, they shrunk noticeable after the first wash. I would not purchase again.",3
B06XWM4PWG,After 1 or 2 washings the neckline is sagging badly. Not high quality.,3
B06XWM4PWG,"So hard to find a V neck anything and forget about pockets. Evidently young people are appalled to see a mans chest hair.  It is OK for women to have deep V blouses to show off their boobs, but mens chest hair must be taboo or something. LOL",5
B06XWM4PWG,"Bought these for my husband as he likes to put them on to sleep at night.  Very nice material, comfortable and fits nicely.",5
B06XWM4PWG,"I try to buy from local small business but, I have to say these Amazon Essential v-neck white T-shirts are outstanding quality. 100% cotton, comfortable and go with everything. I love them. I'm a huge fan!!!!",5
B06XWM4PWG,Im was surprised by the quality of the shirts for the price. Will def buy again,5
B06XWM4PWG,"Arrived very quickly in Amazon's minimal paper pkg. Love that!The t-shirts wrere tighly rolled, so all fit in a minimal plastic bag with touch seal.The fit is just fine for me, small to medium man.The quality of the cotton material and construction is very good.My test of a product? I would definitely buy them again.",5
B06XWM4PWG,It was all good,5
B06XWM4PWG,Son frescas y de buena calidad,5
B06XWM4PWG,Comfy Jersey-like tee with little V-neck! Adorable and true to size!,5
B06XWM4PWG,perfect undershirt for work.  Lightweight but sturdy material.  Keeps cool and absorbs sweat pretty good,5
B06XWM4PWG,"First time buying the Amazon version of this product. They seem to be thinner than the name brand undershirts. I will have to see how well thery hold up to wearing and washing on a regular basis, but for now they seen to be fine.",4
B06XWM4PWG,"Soft fabric, tagless, non-pilling material. V-neck cut is even and comfortable. Black color hasn't bled in washing, versatile design, can wear with jeans or nice pants! Well made, lays flat and doesn't roll up at the seam.",5
B06XWM4PWG,"third time I have ordered, these are holding up far better than Hanes or fTL or even Jokey",5
B06XWM4PWG,...And a great fit and price!,5
B06XWM4PWG,Washes eell and kerps shape,5
B06XWM4PWG,"I bought a L and I'm normally a M, however, they weren't as oversized as I like. Keep that in mind when purchasing this item. Regardless, I highly recommend, as the quality and price are fantastic!",4
B06XWM4PWG,"These are a good value for the money.  I'm old enough to remember when these were made in the US.  Made in the US virtually disappeared after Clinton signed NAFTA.  Underwear was one of the last items to be outsourced.These were purchased since my wife is annoyed folding recently purchased ones (Fruit of Looms).  What aggravated her was that it took her longer to keep the end of the sleeve from curling up.  After being asked why I deduced it was due to the previous edge band being about 1/8 of an inch longer.  This prompted her to ask why a company would do this.  The answer, as can guess, is that while some dream of living a good life, companies exist to save a thousandth of a cent per unit.",5
B06XWM4PWG,My favorite undershirts are the Ralph Lauren V necks.  But at 3/$45 I was searching for an alternative and the Amazon basics fit the bill.  They fit well and they washed up nicely.  They aren't quite as soft as the Ralph Lauren shirts but they are very close.  I like that they are a touch longer which will help them stay tucked in better.  Paying 6/$24 is an overall great value and I would purchase them again.,5
B06XWM4PWG,Son excelentes y de buena calidad,5
B06XWM4PWG,"These are probably the most ill fitting undershirts I've ever owned. The arms fit good but the length too short, almost comically short. My wife jokes that I'm wearing a crop top when she sees me in them.",2
B06XWM4PWG,"Liked the style and feel of the V-Neck shirts at first, but with each washing and drying they shrunk a little.  Started off as a 2XL and are now the size of a large.  I can stretch and tug them and still get into them, but they are no longer comfortable. My Hanes V neck shirts are quite a bit older and have never shrunk like these.",3
B06XWM4PWG,These shirts like their boxers breathe like a dream. I was cooler all day in a hot kitchen with it on and stayed cool on my bike ride home in the sun despite being black. Will buy more soon.,5
B06XWM4PWG,"Bought these for my husband to wear under his black dress shirts. He loves them. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. They keep their shape when washed, too.",5
B06XWM4PWG,"Quality is fine. The shirts are too short. I'm only 5'7"", so certainly not tall, intended to use these to wear under button down shirts, but constantly come untucked.",2
B08FBK1KWQ,These look generally like boxers they hold their shape you know they're not flimsy but they're very soft and comfortable,5
B08FBK1KWQ,I'll know how durable they are in a few more months.  They are comfortable and affordable though.  Size was correct and so far there are no frays or loose threads.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,I ordered the six-pack of covered waistband tag-free knit boxers.  They are true to size and perfect for sleeping or lounging.  So comfortable and no binding or twisting or creep.  The package I received were the exact colors and style as shown in the listing picture and a great value.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Well made and are comfortable and easy to throw in the washer  and dryer!!,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Washed well. I should of bought a size down, they  run large and with a lot of stretch. I still like em, and they are whole lot better than my old boxers that are huge on me and falling off me, because of my weight loss.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Taking one star off because the colors were not as described on the product page.  I would describe the colors of the received items as navy blue, red, royal blue, light gray, light blue, and medium gray.  The red and royal blue items are unlike anything in the picture.  But it's not worth the bother to try to get compensation for that.  The boxer shorts are very soft and comfy.  As some other reviews noted, I think they run large compared to the size guidance.  My waist is around 35 and I ordered Medium, even though that's specified for waist sizes 32-34.  I'm very glad I did, because I think Large would have been awfully big for me.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,"I really didn't think these would be anything special, however they are really comfortable!  I've been wearing them every day since I received them and I am a believer!  Not to mention I have paid 3x as much for underwear that was not as comfortable, plus these seem to be well made.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Decent boxers for the price.  The waist band is a little bulky and I think they run a little small.  Maybe go for a size up.  Overall solid purchase.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"My son is be happy with these underwear. His only concern is that he feels like he isn't wearing an,y and he's worried about getting used to the feeling since he might not notice the difference when he isn't actually wearing any.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I like to sleep in shorter cotton boxers such as these. Unforch, it's getting harder to find this type, and since these fit and work perfectly for  me I reordered another pair of sets for the future.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Comfortable and they fit well. The only thing I don't like is the open front.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"They don't flip over in your waist band and are nice knit cotton boxers, good value too, nice and stretchy",5
B08FBK1KWQ,I like them,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Comfy and durable,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Husband love how comfortable they are , no tags, all cotton .",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Very soft and very comfortable,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Got this for my husband and he loves them. is soft and perfect fit around the waistband,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Good fit for big guys,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Good material, thicker than the ""plastic bag"" underwear I be finding now days",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Great item,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Good fit, great price. Value for money. Lots of colors",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Great Christmas gift for my son , fits great , say they're comfortable.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Very Comfortable. Would buy again 100%,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Underwear what is to be said,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"I use them all the time and love the texture and how they feel, looks amazing and their sizes are more than exelent, 100% worth your money.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,My boyfriend loves them!,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"The light gray is 90% cotton, 10% polyester.Wish all six were 100% cotton.Nice fit and feel, though.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,Exactly what I wanted. Thank you,5
B08FBK1KWQ,It took a while but is all good it fits good ...,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I normally wear a sz small.  They fit properly.  Comfortable,  length is not long.  The waist band seems quality.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"My teenage son loves this style. He is 15,  6 foot and skinny.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Well made, true to size, very soft and extremely comfortable. Will buy again!",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Fit real good,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Good fabric quality. Fit well.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I actually am quite impressed with the overal quality;  however, after wearing and washing for a few times, the bottom started to get stretched out. The fabric looks nice and feel comfortable in general and thickness is average. Would've been a 5 start if it was for the overly stretched bottom.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,The texture is very good and very absorbent,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Purchase as a gift & was enjoyed,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"These are not the same as the last time I bought them.  The fabric is different, and the fit is tighter.  I do not care for them.  The other giveaway that they are different, is that these don't have the Fruit of the Loom label on the front of the waistband.",3
B08FBK1KWQ,i would order again,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"awesome quality, great for larger men",5
B08FBK1KWQ,The waist band to top of the crotch is definitely shorter than other fruit of the loom tagless.I do like the feel of the fabric. It just rides a little high.Will not re buy..,3
B08FBK1KWQ,"Thanks very much, I usually don't wear underwear cause I have a 9 inch and nothing fits right until now. I'll get these again.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,"My standard under apparel has been form fitting boxer briefs - a style that's about right during the cold weather months.But the snug fit limits ventilation.When coupled with heavy work during steamy summer heat, the snug boxers trap too much perspiration stays on the skin, leading to crotch skin irritation that persisted, even after careful washing.These loos & floppy soft-knit Boxer shorts have been the answer for me. My nether-region skin is not as sweaty, dries off quicker when the high-activity's over ~ no irritation red patches.They're great for hot summer weather - maybe less so for chill winter work in a snowy wood lot.Time'll tell. ~ The Duffian",4
B08FBK1KWQ,I should have purchased a longer short. I use it to sleep and it will show your junk. OK quality but my bad for selecting a shorter leg short.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"Comfortable, a little too big",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Works great,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I ordered the Large size Fruit of the Loom men's boxer shorts set.  They were obviously oversized for a guy like me who wears size 36 boxers, considered large.  I was going to exchange them for the Medium size boxers because of the cotton fabric and good construction, but could not rely on the fit.  Instead I gifted them to a friend who is pleased with the set.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,Fit like it should and breathable . Good value,5
B08FBK1KWQ,ok,5
B08FBK1KWQ,received exactly as shown,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"i looked at the chart, did the measurements, it said i was at the top end of the large size - they arrived and they're really really baggy, with massive play around the waistband.i like the material and i am hoping the medium size works.such a waste of time.",3
B08FBK1KWQ,"Good fit, great feel. Great value!",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"My husband likes jersey knit boxers, and I bought these ones after seeing how the Hanes ones did not last well. He likes them for the comfort, and I am satisfied with how well they hold up in the wash. I will purchase more.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Fit a little too loose for my liking,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"These are nice but not the colors I ordered. I specifically got these cause I wanted the green. Its the only set on here I found with a green! But we received a red pair instead and besides the dark blue the other 2 blues are off on color but still nice.  REALLY WANTED THE GREEN! Also says this is the second set I've ordered, and I dont own any of these so not sure how that came about!",4
B08FBK1KWQ,My husband loves the comfort of these soft undies.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,I love these boxers.  They are so comfortable and they are so nice looking.I had a set of boxers that I didn't like before because they would start rolling up at the waistband.  It was annoying.These stay on me and don't do any weird bunching up.Absolutely amazing value.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,SoftcomfyColor true to pictureNot as long as I thought but fineCame on time,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Supportive,5
B08FBK1KWQ,This is my second time buying these Fruit of the loom boxer shorts! they are extremely comfortable and come with a multitude of different colors! you wont be disappointed.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Inflation is so bad I cannot afford new clothing. But there are somethings you just don't want to buy used. Underwear being one of them. This fits the need. Cheap, cotton, and covers the sweaty orifices. These will do nicely until our ""elite government"" who is always right and never, ever, makes a mistake has us back to wearing loin clothes.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I'm a large woman, and I was afraid these would end up riding up into a wedgie, but they don't. They're not very long in the leg, but they stay put. Hooray! The quality seems okay. I wash on cold and line dry for environmental reasons, so I can't comment on shrinkage or how they'll survive a lot of heat in laundering process, but they're doing fine for me.I'd give them 5 stars if we could just have a 5 pack of black.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,So soft and perfect length,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I have a favorite kind of boxer that is the most comfiest well-made boxer ever made, and due to my super sensitive skin I can't wear regular Fruit of the Loom keep ones or anything with rough waste band, it literally hurts to wear others I've tried. Unfortunately my favorite does not come in larger sizes and sadly with the medication I was taking I have gotten big way too big to fit into my normal ones so I bought some others hoping they would work and luckily this product worked pretty great, they fit perfectly they feel a little bit more thin and Breezy than my others and the waistband isn't 100% perfect but they did make it mostly soft which is what I need and wanted. I wish my other brand made them in a bigger size but these will suffice until I lose weight. Also they are very loose fitting so great for big thighs and big people in general. Thanks!",4
B08FBK1KWQ,New boxers! No holes! I can finally let go of my old boxers. I just purchased another crop. More need not be said.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I ordered these for sleeping shorts. Nig, comfortable and just what I wanted. Soft material and lightweight.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,"Very good quality very soft, nice, thick material. I would recommend and I plan on buying again.",5
B08FBK1KWQ,Soft and roomy but the waist band is a little frumpy,4
B08FBK1KWQ,Very comfortable,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"Quality is good, 100% cotton, good fit.  Waistband is substantial, these feel more like jersey shorts than underwear and they have a tendency to ride up.  Seem is straight down the middle, so they may ride up into your nether region which is unpleasant.  If you want inexpensive shorts with no pockets, this is it.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,He loves the comfort and softness of the material. He also loves the fabric covered waist band. Will buy more in the future!!,5
B08FBK1KWQ,My husband loves these underwear. They are consistent and fit well.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,"The quality of the boxers seems to be good, and they fit well, but I received them in different colors compared to the ones shown.",4
B08FBK1KWQ,comfortable and fit perfectly,5
B08FBK1KWQ,Meet expectations but slightly thicker material than I wanted. But they are keepers.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,Take something better,3
B08FBK1KWQ,These are really the size they say they are.  You can trust they.  My son is 6ft 6 inches and he is very happy with the purchase.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"I give it a five because the are get material, only problem they runs large..",5
B08FBK1KWQ,They're very soft and correctly sized.  Hopefully they'll hold up over time.,5
B08FBK1KWQ,"My fiance's exact quotes "" It's almost like I'm not wearing anything, but if I dribble a little bit I know it's not going to show through my shorts""  there you go folks! You heard it! Go buy these! #oldmanproblems",5
B08FBK1KWQ,I didn't like and couldn't control the selection of colors.,4
B08FBK1KWQ,My go to.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Warm but not hot. Strong and durable. Doesn't shrink in wash. Soft and stays up on ankles. Fits my size 10 mens feet. My feet always sweat but these socks don't compound the problem. They look stylish too. 2nd set I've bought.,5
B07MGZYK6R,"I purchased these socks noticing that they were sold as a ""10 pack"" and assumed that meant 10 socks (5 pairs). So, I was surprised to receive 10 PAIRS -- now that I look back at the description, I see that it does note ""10 pairs"". They were a great value for the price at half the quantity, so getting double was a pleasant surprise! After one wash, there were a few loose threads, but for the most part these socks seem durable enough for the price. They are on the thin side, but definitely feel like soft cotton.",5
B07MGZYK6R,"Fits all my sons, from mens size 8 to 11 just perfect. They are very happy with the comfort level, softness, airyness for sweat and ability to last all day long on their feet in them. They are durable and thickness is just right.",5
B07MGZYK6R,"Great socks! I originally thought we were shorted one sock, but we found it! My husband loves them!!",5
B07MGZYK6R,Thses socks really stand up to wear and are very comfortable.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Good quality but not as big as X-XL suggested,4
B07MGZYK6R,These socks are well made. Thick enough at the toe and heel to avoid wear and tear but thin enough to avoid overheated feet.Great material and you can't beat the price for 10 pair!,5
B07MGZYK6R,"You need to have larger sizes for sizes 15,16",4
B07MGZYK6R,This was a good price for a quality product. I used t his for personal use.,5
B07MGZYK6R,"Second time buying these, comfortable socks and i got about 2 years before wearing the last order out",5
B07MGZYK6R,Good fit. Look good. Satisfied. Thanks.,5
B07MGZYK6R,"I ordered the xls as I'm a size 13 shoes, and these are the best fitting socks I've ever had. Super soft and comfortable as well.",5
B07MGZYK6R,Perfect,5
B07MGZYK6R,very comfortable,5
B07MGZYK6R,The best sucks!,5
B07MGZYK6R,My shoe size is 13.5wide. Buy the larger socks.,5
B07MGZYK6R,"Overall, very good. They do start to break down quicker than I would like with heavy use.",4
B07MGZYK6R,Great work socks love the price and the quantity no complaints here,5
B07MGZYK6R,The grey toes and heals are unnecessary and we almost didn't buy them,4
B07MGZYK6R,Very fast and totally correct,4
B07MGZYK6R,"I have a size 13 foot that is extra, extra wide [4E] AND I am a little chunky.  Tried on straight out of the package and the extra large were already a little too tight on my foot for comfort.  Thought maybe they sent me the wrong size, but I could see the XL stitched into the ankle cuff.  The length of it did hit about the right spot for low cut socks on my foot just below ankle. Also had impression from the reviews that they were a little thicker than many other brands, but did not feel or look noticeably thicker.  Maybe because they were stretched pretty tight.  I read they shrink  when dried in the dryer so I am giving these to my son who is a size 10 1/2,  does not have wide feet, and is not 80 lbs overweight.",4
B07MGZYK6R,I have these set up on auto-ship every six months for my teenage son. We've tried several brands and these are the only ones that consistently didn't end up with holes in the bottom after a couple of months. They fit and hold their shape well and do not pill in the wash. These have a band around the arch that provides support and he tells me that makes the socks feel better.,5
B07MGZYK6R,"Size runs small, but still fits great.",5
B07MGZYK6R,The comforabilty,4
B07MGZYK6R,good quality and very comfortable,4
B07MGZYK6R,Es lo que esperaba en talla y calidad graciasb,5
B07MGZYK6R,The socks are really nice. They aren't quite as big as they advertise as I wear a size 14 shoe and they are a little snug or lower than I thought. But that's my fault not the socks during good quality shape,4
B07MGZYK6R,Very comfortable very soft,5
B07MGZYK6R,True to size breathable yet comfy ! Wore socks around the house and they got linty but idc bc nobody is going to be looking !,5
B07MGZYK6R,They're socks and they fit.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Best socks ever,5
B07MGZYK6R,I brought these socks for my husband. He really likes how soft they are and not restricted.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Daily use,5
B07MGZYK6R,"I've been buying these for years. I have issues with sock seams on my toes, but these are great! Absolutely no uncomfortable feelings due to the seams. They keep my feet warm and are a great value for the money.",5
B07MGZYK6R,Nice cushion and fit.,4
B07MGZYK6R,For a larger foot these are perfect. Just hope they don't shrink in the wash!,5
B07MGZYK6R,I like how the fit there soft and true to size breathable,5
B07MGZYK6R,Great socks and value! Now my middle daughter has started stealing them to wear. Love em!,5
B07MGZYK6R,Not too thick and just right.,5
B07MGZYK6R,The socks fit great for the person I bought them for. They wear a size 15 shoe and color find and socks to fit and these did,5
B07MGZYK6R,Fits perfect for my boyfriend and very soft and comfortable!,5
B07MGZYK6R,....Who would have thought when the kid got older he wouldn't mind socks and underware.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Very nice and comfortable,5
B07MGZYK6R,This is a very good product  .I've bought them many time .,5
B07MGZYK6R,Nice item,5
B07MGZYK6R,They fit size 13-24 shoe size. Most socks say they do but pull tight on rows all day so they hurt and/or they are too tight on ankles. My husband has muscular calves and large ankles and feet.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Great size & comfort,5
B07MGZYK6R,Socks are thick ..not cheaply made..comfy...keep feet warm,5
B07MGZYK6R,Perfect for large feet comfortable,5
B07MGZYK6R,Great product.  Perfect fit.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Socks yes the almighty socks,5
B07MGZYK6R,My sons and son-in-law will.live these for Christmas,5
B07MGZYK6R,"They're good socks, just order them bigger.",4
B07MGZYK6R,It's hard finding good quality easy fitting socks for my big feet.  So I was happy to have found these.  I'll probably buy another pack so that I can go ahead and replace all the old socks that I have that are either old and worn or I never wore because I didn't like their fit.  These are a great replacement.,5
B07MGZYK6R,"Bought these for my partner, he really liked them!",5
B07MGZYK6R,Great product and price. I like how the design of the socks are a little tighter in the arch area.,5
B07MGZYK6R,They are very comfortable sweat resistant!,5
B07MGZYK6R,Purchased as gift. He requested as he had before and loved them.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Bought these for my husband twice.  The first round started to wear out after a year or so and he requested I buy the same ones.  He said they are the best socks he's ever had.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Quality product,5
B07MGZYK6R,"I wear a size 11 shoe, and the socks are tight. However, they hold up all day and don't stretch or sag.",4
B07MGZYK6R,"I've gotten ankle socks before, supposedly in my size range, but they're always too tight around the toes. So I got these in the next size range higher. They're better, not perfect, but good enough. Fairly comfortable otherwise.",4
B07MGZYK6R,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Very thick and comfortable! Exactly what I was looking for at an amazing price! Amazon does it again.,5
B07MGZYK6R,One sock had a hole on the top. Others seen fine,3
B07MGZYK6R,"Bought these for my husband is very picky about his socks. He loves them. They are thick, sizing is accurate as he has a larger foot. His feet don't sweat and they appear to be durable enough to wear for months. I was skeptical seeing the price but they are amazing!",5
B07MGZYK6R,Perfect gift,5
B07MGZYK6R,Nice balance between thick and thin. Just right for casual wear.,4
B07MGZYK6R,Not highest quality but good value for the price,4
B07MGZYK6R,Fit well even after wash and dry,5
B07MGZYK6R,"And looks like good quality. Just too thick for me in the summertime, which is when you would be wearing these kind of socks.",4
B07MGZYK6R,good,5
B07MGZYK6R,"My grandson loves these socks, perfect gift",5
B07MGZYK6R,Been trying to find some ankle socks that last. So far so good!,5
B07MGZYK6R,Very comfortable. They don't bunch up in your shoe either.,5
B07MGZYK6R,They fit and feel good!,4
B07MGZYK6R,"They were well rated, was looking for cushioned socks for my husband who keeps getting holes in his socks, returned these the second they came because they were so thin and only ""padded"" in the tiny grey zone and nowhere else.  Waste of time.",3
B07MGZYK6R,I've only been wearing them for a week so I've yet to wash any. However I find that while they feel really comfortable when I first put them on after wearing them a while I feel like my toes are being scrunched. Oddly more so at the end of the day when I take my shoes off.,4
B07MGZYK6R,I bought these for my son. As he only wears black socks. Now if you have a picky child you will know what I'm referring to. The socks are perfect in the toes! No inside stings loose ect. These are now the only socks my son will wear. I look forward to purchasing more. Plus they are all the same color! Bonus for mom. Easy to match after wash!,5
B07MGZYK6R,nice socks well worth the money,4
B07MGZYK6R,Its soft and quality is good.,4
B07MGZYK6R,Got this set for my son after i bought same for my self a month earlier. Very Soft. Feet can breath and its not like some synthetic stuff. Very nice price for the product as well.,5
B07MGZYK6R,Son wanted black ankle socks and like these so o ordered them for him. They are soft and he likes them.,5
B07MGZYK6R,they arrived on time and were a good value...have a little concern with the toe material since it appeared a little thin after one wearing playing golf...we will see after some use...,4
B07MGZYK6R,Lasted for almost a year,5
B07MGZYK6R,My grandsons I raise love these socks. They are comfortable and light. The only problem encountered was sizing. We purchased the extra large for over size 13 as my oldest grandson wears 13 shoes; however these socks barely fit him and I will have to find something bigger for him. They fit the younger grandson at size 9 so we are keeping them as they are good socks and a good deal.,4
B07MGZYK6R,Stocking stuffers but a little disappointed at the thinness of the material,3
B07MGZYK6R,"-not bad sox if you like thin sox, these are super thin, and very stretchy!  I wear a size 11.5 US and i would not get these if i were any larger, these things have to stretch quite a bit to get over my feet.  size 12 would really be pushing it.  other than that i'm happy with my thin sox.",4
B07MGZYK6R,Its hard to find socks in size 15. The4y were comfortable & affordable.,5
B07MGZYK6R,These socks are very comfortable and the material does allow for breathability.  The material is soft as well.  My only complaint is that they are a little bit taller than I was expecting.,4
B07MGZYK6R,"The socks are kind of thin, which I like.I bought the xl because I wear a size 13. These socks were very tight and constricted my toes too much.The quality seemed fine. But I will be giving these socks away.",4
B07MGZYK6R,"Good quality product, especially for the price.  Soft. First purchase lasted quite awhile (maybe a year)before some pairs started wearing thin.",5
B07MGZYK6R,There's not much to say other than they are comy and fit really nice and snug. They are sturdier than normal socks because my dog snagged it's tooth on it and didn't cause a hole which was nice. I wear these everyday to work and they keep my feet comfortbale and don't overheat.,5
B08H3K93XX,"Great quality, soft feel even after multiple washes, does NOT shrink which is great, value is good, fast shipping, fits to size, as described, stretchy. Great wear and breathable.",5
B08H3K93XX,Great shorts! Very comfortable and they fit well!,5
B08H3K93XX,"I bought this thinking it was Sport X-temp Ultra Lightweight Boxer Briefs that I've been wearing for a number of years. The support on the Sport X-temp Ultra Lightweight Boxer Brief is great. So much so you can use them as an athletic supporter. They are lightweight and breathable. There are only two fabrics in the Sport X-temp Ultra Lightweight Boxer Briefs: polyester and spandex. Hanes uses less spandex in this underwear and that makes all the difference. I wear a medium, but in Sport X-temp Ultra Lightweight Boxer Briefs I wear a small - great support, and it really hugs my body. Even after years washings they still hold their stretch.",4
B08H3K93XX,"Hanes Total Support Pouch Men's Boxer Brief Underwear offers excellent comfort and support. The breathable fabric feels soft against the skin, while the Total Support Pouch helps keep everything in place without feeling restrictive. The waistband is snug but not tight, and the design ensures a smooth fit under clothes. With moisture-wicking technology, they stay dry throughout the day. Overall, these boxer briefs are a great choice for those seeking comfort and support in their everyday underwear.",5
B08H3K93XX,I have been wearing underwear shorts for a long time. I am 88. These are the most comfortable I have ever worn. The support pouch and overall fit make them a quality product. I highly recommend them.,5
B08H3K93XX,"Hanes underpants are a reliable and affordable option for everyday comfort. Made with soft cotton, they provide a breathable fit that keeps you feeling fresh throughout the day.",5
B08H3K93XX,"Okay, so I would add a photo but y'all might faint with my husband's hotness in these, so I will stick to what I  can say with words :DThe hubby has struggled to find underwear he likes at local stores the last few years and wanted to try out the sack-toting styles featured all over Amazon. We tried a couple of brands and he was not too thrilled, they were weak and thin and rode up his crack. We went back to reviewing other options and found these.he long leg was the first thing that appealed - my husband is 6'6"" and quite muscular. These fit his leg length very well and look a lot better than the shorter lengths.Next was the pouch for his junk. He has ALWAYS complained about being pinched in clothing and the pouch on these keep his junk in place without constricting it. He likes the support and thickness of the material as these are not see-through and feel like you have something on while also being breathable and smooth-fitting.From my end of things, these are totally worth getting for your guy, gals. The dude looks super hot wearing these, especially if he is in relatively decent shape. We have gotten three packs of these so far and plan to get another as my husband now hates all other underwear. If you are on the fence, try these, they are awesome!Husband's review:I was looking for new underwear online.  Much like everything else in the world underwear design is always changing.  Now there are lots of companies making a boxer/brief hybrid that has some sort of compartment to hold your boys in place.While I can't really comment on how these compare to the vast array of what is out there now, I did try one other brand (Saxx) prior to this that I did not really like.  I decided to try again with this new style, but to get something from a maker that I was familiar with this time. It was between three brands whose products I have used for years, and Hanes was picked because they were the ones who had my size in stock when I ordered.I will say that I was very pleased with these.  I saw several reviews on here comparing these to Saxx unfavorably while pointing out that the pouches on the two brands are made differently.  Yes, they are different and that is precisely why I like these.  The Hanes flaps join at the bottom which means once the boys are there, they stay there.  The boys are lifted up and way from your body. No more hanging out the leg of your boxers.  I am sure we have all had those days where the boys get pulled to one side and you sit down and they get caught up in the elastic of your underwear and holy cow that hurts.  Well, now they stay put right out front.  I found these to be much more comfortable than the Saxx. I felt that the flaps joining at the bottom actually provide a support that was lacking in the Saxx underwear.  I haven't had these long, but I have ordered two more packs based on how much I actually like these.",5
B08H3K93XX,"I'm 77 years old and for my entire life I wore regular briefs. They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks but I'm an old dog and for the life of me I don't know why I haven't tried something different. These Hane's boxers are just so comfortable you hardly know your wearing anything. So if you're an old dog or even if you're not and you've been wearing briefs, do yourself a favor and try these boxers you'll be a very comfortable old dog.",5
B08H3K93XX,I was unable to find these or any long leg boxers in the 2XL size I needed in any of my local stores. Thankfully they had these online in my size. They are comfortable and fit beautifully. They don't ride up and are just an overall great fit.,5
B08H3K93XX,"This is my husband's first try with trunk-style underwear after wearing standard briefs all of his life. But he is in his mid-70s and needs a little more support, so I decided to try this style. I tried another brand but it didn't have the opening for bathroom use, which he desired. He likes the fit of these, the short trunks, and the additional support they give. And they are very affordable. Win, win. I will probably be buying more of these for him.",5
B08H3K93XX,"These are the only underwear I buy now. I am a large man - over 500lb about 6 feet tall. These are incredibly stretchy and don't ride up. I wear them under my belly, so might not fit if you wear them on your actual waist. Moisture wicking and breathable, I love them!",5
B08H3K93XX,These boxers are awesome. Quality could be a little better for the cost but makes your package look great and the support is nice,5
B08H3K93XX,My husband's first grab every morning. He loves them as a bigger guy.,5
B08H3K93XX,"These are nice.  They look good, stay where they are supposed to. Nice fit",5
B08H3K93XX,These are more as comfortable and just as supportive as the expensive ones I've gotten from other brands in the past. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a a pair of boxer briefs.,5
B08H3K93XX,Good fit,5
B08H3K93XX,Very thin but comfortable material. They fit and feel fine,4
B08H3K93XX,"I never thought something could make this much difference, but MAN that little sack hammock is brilliant!! Extremely comfortable and functional with the added bonus of the pouch accentuating the appearance of stuff. You'll never sit on 'em or batwing again. Get these",5
B08H3K93XX,"They really make the package bulge out. Looks great at home, but not for wearing out to work or in public anywhere. The legs ride up though, which is why I took off a star",4
B08H3K93XX,"I'm a 42"" waist, right on the borderline of sizes - so I ordered the next size up, 2XL.  Waist is snug enough that I'm thinking I'll be replacing them (unless they stretch with a bit of wear).  Otherwise they are comfy.",4
B08H3K93XX,"I like these underwear because they are soft and comfortable.  They are think enough, but not too thick.  I would buy again.",5
B08H3K93XX,I purchased 2 six packs of these Hanes same style and material blend 8ish years ago and wear them exclusively changing every day and they are all in great shape. These dry fast in extreme humid summer weather and are very comfortable. I purchased this order to give as a gift.,5
B08H3K93XX,"My Husband loves these, they keep the boys cool & comfy. They aren't as tight as shown.",5
B08H3K93XX,sizing chart is not accurate,5
B08H3K93XX,Affordable comfortable like em would suggest others to purchase Hanes usually good quality,4
B08H3K93XX,"These underwear are the greatest invention in modern history. They separate your naughty bits from your thighs, worth its weight in gold.",5
B08H3K93XX,They support the boys! Worth the money.,5
B08H3K93XX,These were bought as a birthday/holiday gift for a special person.  I'm sure he loves them,5
B08H3K93XX,"I bought these underwear about 2 months ago because my legs were chafing alot, i thought they would hold for much longer but i have already thrown out like 3 pairs already. Dont get me wrong they help out alot to stop chafing but the quality isn't there.",4
B08H3K93XX,"True to size. Good length for someone 6'3"".",4
B08H3K93XX,"Love these!  Was hesitant at first but the ""kangaroo pouch"" is amazing for the junk. Very comfy and keeps it from sticking to your leg or getting sat on.",5
B08H3K93XX,You delivered it with address on clear package of underwear.  Always before orders came in white envelope.  I live in assisted living community.  It is nobody else's business what I order.  I want to orderagain but hesitate because of this indescretion.  Think your shipping people need to be told.,4
B08H3K93XX,Its nice to feel supported..finally,5
B08H3K93XX,"My boyfriend loves these! Great quality, high elasticity, they stay in place, no shrinkage and definitely look great on him!",5
B08H3K93XX,Very comfortable and run true to size,5
B08H3K93XX,"I enjoy the roomy interiors of these briefs and they are also lighter, thus freer! They work well with any pair of pants, too!",5
B08H3K93XX,These briefs are just perfect! The fit the feel the comfort the flexibility the material is just perfect. Wish I found these many years ago I'm glad I gave these a try.,5
B08H3K93XX,"Super comfortable, no pinching.  He threw out his other boxers after two days of wearing these.",5
B08H3K93XX,"I like these the way they fit and feel, that I bought a second order.",5
B08H3K93XX,"So let's start with pros. They are super comfortable, great material and look great highly recommend them. But the downside for men that have bigger Johnsons there needs to be a bigger pouch. The Johnson kicks out the boys often.",4
B08H3K93XX,"Good value for the money, good quality and fit",5
B08H3K93XX,Very nice quite comfortable,5
B08H3K93XX,Great quality boxer brief with unmatched support. No reason to spend money on more expensive brands; quality and fit are spot on. FYI the medium fits a 32 waist perfectly.,5
B08H3K93XX,Exact fit and comfortable.,5
B08H3K93XX,Nice quality good feel,5
B08H3K93XX,Reasonable priced,4
B08H3K93XX,My husband says they are comfortable.,5
B08H3K93XX,As advertised,5
B08H3K93XX,I was tired of the old underwear stretched & worn holes.,5
B08H3K93XX,Hubs loves these ball-huggers undies,4
B08H3K93XX,Good fit,5
B08H3K93XX,Never thought these would be as comfortable as they are. Going back to other styles of underwear just feels horrible now. Good support. Ill never go back.,5
B08H3K93XX,"Perfect size, high quality fabric, and nice colors, it is a bit expensive.",4
B08H3K93XX,comfort and durable,4
B08H3K93XX,"They fit perfectly, no shrinkage, look great, love the quality and the stretchiness works brilliantly because of my occupation.",5
B08H3K93XX,"Great have ordered three sets, fits great",5
B08H3K93XX,My husband loved these and seem to be the best one for construction he is into roofing definitely will bye more,5
B08H3K93XX,Nice underwear it also has a little pouch or sling to keep everything in place. Don't know how I ever used any other underwear after these,5
B08H3K93XX,To many black pair,5
B08H3K93XX,"Gentleman, these fit awesome.  The pouch is perfect and I love the length of the Shorts.  So good I, immediately purchased a second set.  I tossed all of my other undies away.  These are great.  I highly recommend purchasing these.",5
B08H3K93XX,"Needed a replacement for shinesty brand which has gotten too expensive, these are a good alternative.",5
B08H3K93XX,I'm 69 yrs old and have worn a lot of Draws---> THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST I'VE EVER PURCHASED... IF YOU LIKE PERFECT FIT GET THESE ---> I PUT  MY REPUTATION ON MY WORD!!,5
B08H3K93XX,The boxers are great but the pocket area does not hold up to multiple washes after 3rd or 4th use started feeling loose.,4
B08H3K93XX,They feel great. The pouch helps the berries from sticking. The front fly opens easy so you don't feel like your cutting your wee-wee off.,5
B08H3K93XX,Like how they fit,5
B08H3K93XX,These are great when working in the hot and humid climates. These do not chaff or hurt after a couple hours in triple digits temperatures.,4
B08H3K93XX,They are decently soft material but they hold well.,4
B08H3K93XX,"These fit well and they're pretty comfortable, they go down the leg a good amount so helps with chafing and pretty warm for winter too.",5
B08H3K93XX,"I was, for years, a plain white briefs purist.Then I tried these because I got a pack dirt cheap at a department store. And then I bought more here, because I love them.They're snug enough to look good, but stretchy enough to fit comfortably and not feel tight. The pocket, which I thought was stupid, makes the incredibly comfortable. They are soft and, more importantly, VERY breathable.Durability seems fine - they do develop thin looking areas fairly quickly, but don't seem, in my experience this far, to wear fully through or tear - at least, not any faster than other underwear I've owned, and probably a bit slower.Yes, they cost more than what I have been buying my whole life, but it's worth every penny in my mind - and they're still far cheaper than many other brands.",5
B08H3K93XX,Great Comfortable Fit. Most Comfortable Underwear I've Ever Owned. Keeps Everything Together. Pouch Really works. Can't Beat the Price. I'd Buy Again.,5
B08H3K93XX,"Great for, comfortable, room to breathe",5
B08H3K93XX,Just the small extra (internal) feature makes a significant difference in comfort.,5
B08H3K93XX,No dislikes--a fine product--very pleased with the quality of the goods,5
B08H3K93XX,"Great shorts!! I bought a dozen pair for each day of the week plus a couple of others.Seriously, best fit ever with enough room for comfort but not enough for bounce. I like these!",5
B08H3K93XX,This is the only brand/style of underwear that my husband likes because of the support pouch.We were going to buy them from Kohl's like we usually do but they were cheaper on Amazon.  They were on backorder on Amazon for about a month but that was not a problem for us.,5
B08H3K93XX,"So I've been a commando guy for the last 30 years! I never saw the need for boxers, and any briefs I bought were way too restrictive! Most of the briefs, yes I include boxer briefs, didn't even perform the job they were supposed to do because there was no room for the package. The package stretched the material out away from my body and still allowed the boys to stick to my thigh and didn't stop the chaffing. I swear men's underwear were designed by women as torture devices, until recently!These babies do it all! Most of the time, I can't tell I'm even wearing underwear! They allow the room needed while separating the jewels from the thighs and supporting them. It's a beautiful thing and a wonder that it took almost 100 years to come up with the design!As for durability. I don't have that info. I've only been wearing them for 2 weeks.As for the fit. I'm 6' tall and 280lbs. The 3x tall seem almost a little too snug on my legs, and I have to roll the waistband down to keep it from folding over. I originally didn't like the long length of the tall, both at the waist and legs. So I ordered some 2x regular. They were way too short in the leg, but the waist was in the right place. So big in one place, but little in another. Still not uncomfortable though.UPDATE: I purchased some 2x long.  The leg opening feels the same size as the 3x, but now the waist and buttocks area fits much better! The pouch does feel like it has a bit less room than the 3x. Still not enough to make them uncomfortable to me. However, those who are more endowed will probably feel like they are restrictive.",5
B08H3K93XX,Durability,4
B08H3K93XX,You won't be able to keep your shirts tucked in very long on your backside because they are slippery polyester. Not to mention holding in moisture and bad aromas. Good luck!,3
B08H3K93XX,Have tried several brands and finally found a great for my husband and the lenght is great.,4
B08H3K93XX,very soft,5
B08H3K93XX,I am on a diet and have lost enough weight that I needed smaller underwear. I almost always get Hanes.,5
B08H3K93XX,"I always buy multiple packs when purchasing boxers briefs so they will be all new and on a steady rotation. These are comfortable, hold your parts fairly well, but they will not last 3-4 months. I have 4 pairs left out of the 9 that don't have the crotch completely blown out. I think these brands are doing this stuff on purpose so you need to buy more. I use to work a lot harder labor jobs in my youth and underwater could last over a year. Now I sit at a desk, go bowling, go for walks, yard work and can't find a lasting pair.",3
B08H3K93XX,Works as advertised.,4
B08H3K93XX,"I've been wearing these so obviously like them. I""m sorry to say I needed a larger size and these worked out great. The only thing about the order was how long it took to receive them and how little information was given about when they would be delivered.",5
B08H3K93XX,Cheap and work but the build quality needs a bit of improvemen ton stitching,4
B08H3K93XX,The pouch makes it very comfortable. My wife loves seeing me in these. I am ordering more today.,5
B08H3K93XX,"Looks good, but seems a little tight on legs",4
B08H3K93XX,5 stars,5
B08H3K93XX,"I can't force my body to stay a certain size, so Imoved up to a larger sice and what a comfortable difference it makes.",5
B08H3K93XX,"Order 1 size up from what ya need! I've ordered the L and they ride up a lot. Otherwise! Great fit, don't shrink in the wash, and if you work outside in the southern heat the nut holster is great!",4
B09XGV95JV,This track suit was exactly what I had in mind. The material has good quality and the fabric is soft and smooth. It's cut a little small so I got the next size and it fits well. Has a nice polished look. Pants are tapered nicely and the jacket has pockets. Good zipper. All around nice and classic outfit.,5
B09XGV95JV,"Bought as gift and sent to Europe, perfect size, great quality, very comfortable and price was great!",5
B09XGV95JV,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                This is a very nice track suit. It is true to size. My husband loves it. I wish they had more colors. The price is a great value. Good quality suit.He says it is comfortable.,5
B09XGV95JV,"Good quality fabric. Unfortunately, it runs small vs other name brand track suits.",4
B09XGV95JV,"I bought this suit for my son who is 6'3''.  He wore it tonight and it looked good on him.  He is muscular but thin and it fit him to a tee.  It is a durable material in addidas black and white fashion.  It is warm, the zippers are rugged and best of all it brings you back to the soccer days of younger years.",5
B09XGV95JV,"True to size, great classic look, I loved it",5
B09XGV95JV,I love it  .. exactly as pictures,5
B09XGV95JV,Perfect,5
B09XGV95JV,Bueno la talla es correcta,5
B09XGV95JV,Love it,5
B09XGV95JV,"Thin, and I have some of better quality, but nice track suit",4
B09XGV95JV,"Expensive Halloween costume, makes for a great set of pajamas. Workout? Gross, this is Murica.",5
B09XGV95JV,Color and quality was good.  I'm happy that I bought it,4
B09XGV95JV,Great price. I wanted green or red but for the price I had to get this!!,5
B09XGV95JV,"Nice clothes, but the material didn't convince me.",4
B09XGV95JV,Love love the way it fits,5
B09XGV95JV,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like it,4
B09XGV95JV,Everyone that I gave the pj's to really liked them,5
B09XGV95JV,This was the fastest shipping so far. Received it the next day in perfect condition.,5
B09XGV95JV,Lighter version.,5
B09XGV95JV,Exactly what I wanted,4
B09XGV95JV,Uno de los regalos mas bonitos que he podido enviar.  Viste.bien y super comodo .,5
B09XGV95JV,Just as advertised,5
B09XGV95JV,"I ordered this set twice before receiving it. It had delivery problems but when I finally got it, we were beyond pleased it was a great fit and was exactly what we wanted. The price point was good if compared to other retailers. It was a gift that was wanted and needed.",5
B09XGV95JV,1,4
B09XGV95JV,Tal cual la foto,5
B09XGV95JV,Honestly felt very cheap like an Adidas knockoff,3
B09XGV95JV,It is nice with good quality,5
B09XGV95JV,Fits well,5
B09XGV95JV,"Great quality, accurate size",5
B09XGV95JV,Got my LL Cool J & RUN DMC look going strong!!!!,5
B09XGV95JV,"Purchased for my dad as a Christmas Gift. Am pretty sure he will like. This is the fabric he was asking for. He wanted so he could just look sporty in a sweat suit, but not fleece.",5
B09XGV95JV,Great quality and style for the price point.,5
B09XGV95JV,"I am 5'8"" and 166lbs. I ordered a Medium. I should have ordered Large, I knew this. I immediately ordered another tracksuit that will fit better. Yeah, the quality is that good. I have no regrets. Now I'll have two. :) Definitely recommend. Sizes are correct. My ego was not.",5
B09XGV95JV,Present was well received.,5
B09XGV95JV,It matches the one my son bought from Kohls but was cheaper in price and material.  The collar on the jacket is a thin rough version of my sons.  The pockets on the jacket and pants are netted material and not great but ok compared to softer normal pocket material on the Kohls one.  The pants material sticks to my knees when jogging unlike the kohls one.  It's really a 1 star product for me cause all the cheap stuff makes me not want to ever wear it.  But it's ok and fine enough probably to last just as long as the identical ones they sell in stores.,3
B09XGV95JV,"Good quality, excellent name brand.",5
B09XGV95JV,Nice sweat suit love it,5
B09XGV95JV,Very good product,5
B09XGV95JV,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!,5

B09XGV95JV,I received my order with one day which is amazing! The track suit fit perfect to the size I selected.,5
B09XGV95JV,Wonderful,5
B09XGV95JV,Me gusto y queda bien,5
B09XGV95JV,"The fabric of great quality, I got the track suit in black which is exactly as showcased. The garment's fit exudes sporty and sophistication, characterized by its streamlined silhouette and the subtly tapered leg design.Loved this  sports suit that I also purchased it in the shade of blue.",5
B09XGV95JV,Item came on time and look great,5
B09XGV95JV,Fits perfectly. Good stretch. Perfect for cycling.,5
B09XGV95JV,I'm bringing the 80's back--seriously. I wear the jacket and pants to work frequently with a white button down shirt. People laughed at first but two of my partners now do the same thing. It's very reminiscent of the Royal Tenenbaum's movie. This quality is great.,5
B09XGV95JV,Good fabrics,5
B09XGV95JV,It very comfortable,5
B09XGV95JV,"For the price, I get to live out my Run DMC fantasies. I would not mind paying double for a bit better quality/better sizing but for what it is, it's ok quality. Pants were a bit short but works if you wear socks and a phresh pair of sneaks. Washes good.",4
B09XGV95JV,A la medida,5
B09XGV95JV,"I bought a top/bottom tracksuit very similar to this from Macys.  Came home and found this set.  It was a bit cheaper and I liked that the legs tapper in a bit but not too much.  The pants I bought from Macy's were old school and very straight leg cut.  While the shape of this is nice, the fabric is not as comfortable.  Its a little scratchy in places.  But, I wont wear it a ton so it will work fine. I returned the other set to Macys.",3
B09XGV95JV,"Si, es como lo esperaba",5
B09XGV95JV,Birthday gift for my brother and I love that it is stitched and not ironed on !,5
B09XGV95JV,Nice track suit,5
B09XGV95JV,Good quality,5
B09XGV95JV,good fit and as expected.,5
B09XGV95JV,I like this product and the way delivered in time,5
B09XGV95JV,"I got this outfit for my husband for a good price.  I couldn't find the royal blue color to buy by the piece, and the price of this outfit was great (less than $50).  For 2 pieces of Adidas wear, I would say that's pretty good.  My husband receives compliments from strangers when he wears this outfit :) I would higly recommend this.  I came back and bought a second set for my son. Great value.",5
B09XGV95JV,Always a good buy,5
B09XGV95JV,Perfect for the cooler temperatures.,5
B09XGV95JV,My son loves this outfit,5
B09XGV95JV,"I had been seeing this track suit make its way into the fashion scene and I was smitten! I had to find one. I'm a lady who ordered the XS adidas Men's track suit in black. It is the perfect fit for my petite frame. I love the way the fabric feels and the length of the pant that I paired with the adidas cloudfoam shoes. The classic adidas stripes bring back such nostalgia of the 80s for me. I LOVE this track suit.I will be ordering my husband one and plan to ""borrow"" his Medium jacket for days that I want a more relaxed jacket.",5
B09XGV95JV,Very good product.,5
B09XGV95JV,Fits my hubby so well. I love the quality and he loves it too. I'm happy. Will buy again!!,5
B09XGV95JV,Love the set and was very good for the price that I paid. The only issue was that the pants ran a little small which was not expected. I did manage to fit but it was a little tight.,5
B09XGV95JV,1st off I look straight out of Ukraine wearing this fit. Like an absolute unit walking into the club. This fit is one for the crothers if you're one of the crothers you would understand. The amount of pu*s you get wearing this fit should be a crime. The moment these women see you they're thinking wow is that Serge Nikolai Vladimir the 3rd. And then immediately take off there clothes. If there was an option to give this more stars I would.,5
B09XGV95JV,"Me quedo muy bien el traje, ya lo estoy utilizando en mis trotes diarios",5
B09XGV95JV,Great value!,4
B09XGV95JV,Well made  Fits great. Nice fabric,4
B09XGV95JV,Large was too tight for me I ended up giving it to my son,4
B09XGV95JV,Fit me as a skinny 6'3,5
B09XGV95JV,Comfy,4
B09XGV95JV,I thought it was made of sport material that dries and keeps you dry!,4
B09XGV95JV,Highly recommend!,5

B09XGV95JV,They are funny,4
B09XGV95JV,"During Superlative Week at my son's school, where they had to represent the 1980s or 1990s, I found it super easy. I bought this tracksuit, along with a cap and some fake oversized gold chains, and voila, my son transformed into an '80s rapper. He looked fantastic and still regularly wears the tracksuit, albeit without the jewelry.",5
B01M3RYHP0,Great valueQuality productSizing is correct and comfortable waist bandLook and fit as advertised,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Excellent assortment of colors, comfortable fit and support, quality cotton, breathable material, and 6 pairs for $18 bucks. Nothing like a brand new pair of underwear. Ordered and received within one day.",5
B01M3RYHP0,"I'm so impressed with these underwear I recently purchased! The material is incredibly soft and breathable, making them perfect for everyday wear. My husband has sensitive skin, but he's had no issues with irritation or discomfort. The fit is spot on - comfortable and supportive without being too tight or constricting. He loves the modern and sleek designs, and I've received many compliments on how great he looks!The quality is exceptional, and the price is very reasonable. I've already ordered more because he's worn them nonstop since getting them. The stitching is solid, and the fabric holds up well to repeated washing. I've tried other brands before, but these are hands-down the best. If you're looking for comfortable, stylish, and affordable underwear for your husband, look no further! 5 stars and a happy husband - what more can I ask for?""",4
B01M3RYHP0,This is my 5th order of these briefs over several years. The fit and comfort is outstanding. They last and wash well. I will certainly reorder in the future.,5
B01M3RYHP0,The mediums are huge but being 100% cotton you can shrink them down for a better fit.  Material is good quality and of decent thickness.  I don't see them coming apart any time soon.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"This is the 2nd time I have bought these in 5 years. The old ones have stretched out a little around the legs. But the waist elastic is still in good shape  The new ones are great. soft, good fit and the price is right. Very comfortable. I still wear the older ones but the new ones i hope will last another 5 years. I would buy these again , delivery was right on time and the packaging was secure.",5
B01M3RYHP0,"They fit really well, seem to be sturdy and well made and I expect they will last a while. Great value.  In my imagination, I look better than Magic Mike in them.",5
B01M3RYHP0,"The basic fit is similar to basic white FTL cotton briefs.  So if those fit, these should be the same in terms of fit and comfort.I've had them for a couple of years and have been able to see the durability.  The first thing that's noticeable is that the ""FRUIT OF THE LOOM"" printing (light grey over charcoal grey) around the waistband will start fading.  Definitely faster if it's machine washed.  The tagless washing instructions are printed on the cotton, and may be difficult to read and will likely be unreadable after multiple washings.  After a while some of the elastic material starting breaking and popping out through the band, especially at the edge of the band but sometimes in the middle.  That's probably just normal wear for any underwear, but these seemed to wear rather fast.  I can't feel them anyways and however much elastic is broken isn't enough to affect the fit.The inside of the band is soft/fuzzy and comfortable, but after enough washings it will start to pill up.  Not a huge deal.  The blue colors will fade (like a dark cotton T-shirt) after enough washings, but that's normal for dark colored cotton.I like them enough (and it looks like the design/materials haven't changed since my last package) that I bought another pack.  So despite all the problems I like these enough to buy them again.",4
B01M3RYHP0,"Men's under-clothes (shorts, socks and tee shirts} take the most damaging cleaning process of all clothing. At least that's my opinion, because of the frequency as well as use of the hottest water baths, and destructive bleach. Now that I am performing all those tasks, I can see how each of the three brands of shorts fare with one-another, and of my brands of shorts, the Fruit of the Loom has lasted the longest. WRL",5
B01M3RYHP0,"I bought the same briefs for my husband 3 years ago and he is still wearing them. They are a bit stretched out, but he has gained some weight.I thought it was time for new ones, so I bought the same ones for Christmas.They look good and the quality is good.He says they are soft and comfortable.The price is very reasonable as well.I recommend them",5
B01M3RYHP0,"Love these briefs. They are the most comfortable I have worn and do not get all baggy like some others I have worn after a few washes. I have ordered the Assorted Color Multipack 3 times now and every time its only shades of Black and Grey, no blue at all. Kinda bummed about that but its not like I am showing them off to all my family and friends!",5
B01M3RYHP0,"Quality and consistency we've grown to expect from Fruit of the Loom briefs. Once you know your size, you can pretty much be sure that you can order the same ones over and over. Love the eco-friendly package it came in and the 9-pack was a good value.",5
B01M3RYHP0,"This is my second time buying these briefs. My first ones are still holding up very well after many months. These are just as good as the more expensive brands, in my opinion. I will definitely buy these again in the future.",5
B01M3RYHP0,"Bought this to replace some old used up underwear. They work okay but are a little bit tight. Should have ordered a size up, my fault.",4
B01M3RYHP0,"Quick delivery. ...I've been hard at work exercising the last 10 months, almost daily, and for the first time in forever, I went down to 32/34. For your underwears to get too big, now that's a special day.",5
B01M3RYHP0,Run small had to order next size to fit,4
B01M3RYHP0,Everything arrived in excellent condition.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Perfect fit and comfortable  love the colors,4
B01M3RYHP0,These have been a good product.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"I never thought id be here lol. But yeah i made the switch to briefs because some dude on tiktok was talking about it so i went with the cheap tighty whities to give it a try. Because the colored ones are like $10 more. And i gotta say these are the most comfortable underwear ive ever worn. No wedgies, or bunching 10/10",5
B01M3RYHP0,Needed more underwear. Easy to order on line.Like the color and fit.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Pretty good.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"it was a Christmas gift ,i had to order these cause Walmart did not have this item .i was happy to find this item",5
B01M3RYHP0,very good product.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Good quality. However these are low rise so consider that when ordering. Also, a little smaller in size then my regular brand.",4
B01M3RYHP0,"First of all, I would like to say I've gotten these the first time 7 years ago and liked them so much I ordered more as I've worn through them. The fabric is comfortable, they fit nicely, and the blue stripes looked great on me imo :-). Pretty decent briefs. These new ones are still nice but I was disappointed that there was no blue like in the product's picture. I'm just not as excited about these ones, sorry. I guess it's still decent underwear, if you don't mind not knowing what colors you're actually going to get.",4
B01M3RYHP0,"Fruit of the Loom Men's Cotton Briefs, Tag Free 9-pack (white):  Still comfortable. But they're noticeably thinner (more sheer) than they've ever been. But for the cost, less than $2 each, I'll still take them.",4
B01M3RYHP0,I guess I forgot this lesson from last time I experimented with sizes.  Adding BIG to the size makes them so big they are unwearable for me.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"These briefs are good quality across the board, BUT I have a great dislike of poorly labeled products. These are printed so faintly with light gray(?) ink on white material. It almost seems that the printer used was completely out of ink and nobody bothered to correct the problem on this lot. Washing instructions are ?, can see 100% cotton by holding these sideways and squiting, country of origin may be either El Salvador or Bangladesh, or Who Knows Where? Size? Good luck finding that!Had these been clearly labeled these might be 5 star, but I can't give a great score to products with poor labeling and/or instructions. Still recommend the brand, but don't rely on the label to let you know you got what you ordered.",4
B01M3RYHP0,bought for my spouse and he is picky about his under ware and how they fit and feel. He loved these. they was and dry with no shrinking,5
B01M3RYHP0,My husband has always preferred Fruit of the Loom briefs.  They are most comfortable and wash up nicely.We have some difficulty finding them in the box stores so buying them online is convenient.,5
B01M3RYHP0,They were a good value for the price paid and fit well,4
B01M3RYHP0,Great bulk packing deal.  They fit perfectly.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Bought these for my son. Good quality and fit was perfect. Would recommend. Price reasonable. Very glad I chose Amazon to make this purchase.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Good,5
B01M3RYHP0,Got for husband. Says they are comfortable. Good fit and good quality material.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Fruit of the Looms seems to be the best.  Hanes sucks and I don't trust the off brands.  I guess some off brands could be ok, but why risk it?",5
B01M3RYHP0,"Husband likes this underwear, good product, fits well and washes nicely",5
B01M3RYHP0,"My husband ""LOVES"" the comfort and how they fit. Not tight at all. Great material used! Very fast delivery, too!",5
B01M3RYHP0,Hubby says they are comfortable and fit fine.,5
B01M3RYHP0,They fit fine if you go up a size.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Not as good as they used to be,5
B01M3RYHP0,Looks nice..feels nice... sort of flimsy... but for the money.. good purchase.You might want buy... a size bigger.,4
B01M3RYHP0,"If your husband likes these kind of older white briefs, he will like these. The material is nice and soft, the fit is properly roomy for guys, and they are nice and white! He likes them enough to say yes, he would recommend them. Brief and to the point .... hehe",4
B01M3RYHP0,They're underwear. They fit. They're affordable. I will keep buying.,4
B01M3RYHP0,"Nice for hubby,he was pleased & so was I. Good colors & quality,durability",5
B01M3RYHP0,A good deal for the price. Don't know yet if they wear as well as more expensive brands.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Ordered 40-42 (250-260 lbs) for hubby. Fit well and comfy soft.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Definitely worth every penny, just order a size up! After wash and dryer they shrink or seems",5
B01M3RYHP0,Same great quality I've always expected from Fruit of the Loom. Good quantity in the package for the price. I tried Walmart first only to find my size not in stock. This is much more convenient and cheaper than searching the shelves in stores.,5
B01M3RYHP0,As always this brand gives you good quality. They are really comfortable. No itch. I've had them for a while already and they are like new.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"I primarily wear basic white fruit of the loom briefs as I find them to be the most comfortable and functional type of men's underwear for daily use. But I wanted to get some color to change it up from time to time. I found these and figured they would be nice to have in the rotation. Typically my experience with colored briefs is they tend to run a little more snug than their white counterparts. I usually wear size med in tighty whities, so I ordered these in lrg and the fit seems to be great after the first wash, not too loose, and supportive in the right places. The fabric is soft and comfy and I expect them to hold up well. My only gripe is the listing had some nice shades of blue which I was hoping for, but I received all black and grey. But that's fine because it said the colors may vary, so I'll just have to keep an eye out for the blue ones when I'm out and about shopping in person. So that said I'd definitely purchase them again, and I would recommend them to anyone who's a fan of briefs. They'd also be great for the younger generation who wants to get away from the annoyances of boxer briefs, but isn't ready to convert back to the ""embarrassing"" tighty whities quite yet.",5
B01M3RYHP0,Good quality and value in this set.,4
B01M3RYHP0,Nice underwear fit perfect.,4
B01M3RYHP0,These are basic briefs. The colors are nice and they seem to be of adequate quality.Bought these before. Price has increased. Time will tell whether the quality is better.,4
B01M3RYHP0,Nothing more to say.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Nice, comfortable, but like most, they lose a bit of shape after multiple washes. Still, a good product.",4
B01M3RYHP0,Perfect fit,5
B01M3RYHP0,Good quality and value,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Just what you need, nothing more",5
B01M3RYHP0,"Material is nice and thick.I bought Hanes for years, but they have gotten shoddier and shoddier.  Hanes' material is very thin and the waist band separates after a few months.These run a bit small.  While I might size up next time, I will buy these again.",5
B01M3RYHP0,Great fir,4
B01M3RYHP0,Looks good and wears good.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Bought for my husband. No complaints the cut was perfect fit. Exactly as described.would purchase again,5
B01M3RYHP0,Great colors very comfortable well made soft material washed well true to size,5
B01M3RYHP0,Good product,5
B01M3RYHP0,As described! Why shop at a store and pay high prices?  Order here!  Great value!  Fast delivery too!,5
B01M3RYHP0,True to size men's underwear,5
B01M3RYHP0,Fit perfect,5
B01M3RYHP0,Well received. Nice quality- comfort -appearance- and good value for the money.,5
B01M3RYHP0,Very nice set of undies. Fabric is soft and the size fit just right.,5
B01M3RYHP0,will shrink after a couple washes,4
B01M3RYHP0,"I ordered two sets of nine briefs in Large size. Delivery was great and they came sealed in two plastic bags inside an Amazon delivery bag. The quality of the briefs is very good and the price was well below any of the bargain brands; including Amazon Basic, George, and Gildan. I would definitely recommend these.",5
B01M3RYHP0,I like tighty whities I prefer low rise these are typical rise but fit nicely do the job hard to beat the price nine pairs in one shot it's a pretty good deal.,5
B01M3RYHP0,It was time to get new underwear and this was a good deal.,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Great look. Excellent wear ability, nice size.",5
B01M3RYHP0,wear comfortably,5
B01M3RYHP0,"Fair priced, excellent quality and most importantly a great fit. Impressed by how long they last even using hot wash and dry.",4
B01M3RYHP0,These Fruit of the Loom Men's Cotton Briefs are very soft.  I wear them for everyday!,5
B01M3RYHP0,"These ate comfortable, colors are cool and as is. Classic quality for this brand overall. Thick fabric",5
B01M3RYHP0,Was having a difficult time finding this size in briefs for men worth the money,5
B01M3RYHP0,Material is soft and comfortable.Little rise on the sides but over all stays in place great. Colors look good,5
B01M3RYHP0,"great product, no  numerical waste size, just s. l, xl,  xxl,  ect?",5
B01M3RYHP0,"I bought these Fruit of the Loom briefs in size 2XL and they were too tight. The waistband was uncomfortable on my belly. So I bought 3XL and they are humongous. The first photo shows the 2XL on top of the 3XL to illustrate the difference one size makes. The second photo is the same photo but zoomed in to show the brand logo and size label. Both pairs were new out of the package and unwashed. It is what it is and my weight fluctuates enough that I'll get use out of both, but just beware of the issue if you are in this size range. Brief's themselves are okay.",3
B01M3RYHP0,"Ok, I'm 5'9., 175 lbs, 33-34 waist, I got the large instead of the mediums,  as someone  else on here suggested,  after one wash and dryer timecm they fit perfect,  not too tight but snug with proper room in the areas you really need, don't get the Mediums if your a 34 waist, I'm pretty positive  you won't keep them. Good quality and support. So glad I ordered one size larger.",4
B01M3RYHP0,"I will not post a picture of these for obvious reasons. My husband found out he had prostate cancer (young only 41 years old, get checked!!) late last year. In January of this year, he had surgery to remove the prostate. He normally wears boxer briefs. Since he is now incontinent, we needed something that would work with is guards/shields. He has been working on exercises with his PT and doctors. Things are getting better, but these underwear are a life saver!! He even told me to order him some more. They are comfortable and he doesn't get too hot in them! At first he was self conscious wearing them, but now he is fine. They don't bunch up his guards or shields at all!! He loves the colors and they are very soft! Yes I do plan on ordering more for my husband. We did get the great news, he is cancer free!! We will continue to buy these until he can control his bladder enough to go back to boxer briefs!!",5
B01M3RYHP0,Like price,5
B01M3RYHP0,Good,5
B01M3RYHP0,Comodos,5
B01M3RYHP0,"I am always a bit leary of buying any clothing online, but I needed more underwear and didn't want to go clothing shopping (which I hate). The underwer was well made and a fairly thick fabric which was comfortable and breathable. Not a bad buy at all!",4
B01M3RYHP0,The waste was a bit loose but otherwise great and feels really comfortable,5
B00LOD51BA,"I've been shopping for new sweatpants for awhile and settled on these. They are very baggy and comfortable. They were a little oversized when I received them but fit perfectly at the waist and after a good wash, shrunk to the absolute perfect size. Still very baggy and comfortable. These are high quality, thick, with good sized and fairly deep pockets. Even the drawstring is higher quality than the shoe lace's they usually use and I doubt they will break or pull through when washed. I bought two and will probably buy one or two more pair in different colors. Very happy with this purchase!",5
B00LOD51BA,"I was looking to get away from the tighter joggers. Saw these and read some reviews saying these were heavy, comfy, high quality baggy sweats. The reviewer was dead on. These sweats are warm, comfy, and heavy, with drawstrings on the waist and elastic draws on the bottom so you can loosen or tighten the cuff on the feet. I am 6'6"" tall and these are just enough length to hit my shoes without dragging on the ground. If you're short you might have to draw the bottoms a little so they don't scuff on the floor. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship. Will be ordering a second pair for my wife!",5
B00LOD51BA,"I'm 6'6 at 185 pounds on the skinnier side. My pant size is a 36W and 36L or sometimes 34L. Decided to give these a try and got the 2XL. They fit great and aren't really loose but I do have to tie if I'm gonna fill my pockets but nothing crazy. The length is actually perfect. 1000/10 fs. Definitely worth the price. Super thick, strong durability, very functional, comfortable. Great color. Don't find myself overheating in them either. Definitely buying more.",5
B00LOD51BA,"Love the fabric. A bit long in the legs, but not that bad.",5
B00LOD51BA,"These have a warm lining and are thick sweatpants material. They're very well made and fit through to size. Great for every day or just around the house, they will keep you warm. A little more expensive than other brands, so we may not purchase too many of these.",5
B00LOD51BA,So far some of the reviews are correct they do run big. I got a 4x but could have gotten a 3x. Washed in cold and dried on lowest setting and for the first time no shrikage. Fit like new. The elastic tensioner held up to a washing. So far am very satisfied.,5
B00LOD51BA,"This is the second pair I have ordered. The first pair is still in excellent shape after 2 winter's wear. My new pair looks exactly the same-- design, quality of material and stitching. The only problem I have is that the elastic ties on the cuff can get caught in things. I never cinch my sweats, so I just remove the ties.",5
B00LOD51BA,"i LOVEEE my pro clubs sooo muchhh, i got a small because i like them baggy but not like massive and they were perfect",5
B00LOD51BA,I ordered directly from Amazon to avoid the possibility of getting a fake or replica. They are 100% authentic and they look good. The elastic waistband helps if you're in between sizes,5
B00LOD51BA,"So I'm 6'5 260lbs and wear a 40x36 in jeans, some 40x34. These are long enough although I would prefer an extra inch. The only problem I have with them is at the leg opening they're to wide. By atleast 1-2 inches. They're not un-wearable but even with boots they kinda look like parachute pants. I'll keep em, although my favorite pair that are almost exactly like these are the ""Dream USA"" brand. They are exactly like these, but the leg opening is 1-2 inches smaller. Same style, length everything as these. I'll keep these tho, as its not easy finding pants that fit. They're definitely comfortable.",4
B00LOD51BA,my grandson loves them,5
B00LOD51BA,Awesome! Thick. Great Quality.My daughter size zero wears these in men's small for a cute baggy look.,5
B00LOD51BA,purchased for my husband and I re-ordered immediately.  He says they are comfortable and WARM.  Thank you for a super product.,5

B00LOD51BA,Super genial,5
B00LOD51BA,"My teenage daughter lives in these. They are heavy weight super soft sweats. She loves the feel of them. We got the black, and they are a true black. The fabric washes well. These sweats do fit true to size. They have a baggy look, which is what she wanted. These would look good on any body type.",5

B00LOD51BA,My son loves these pants he says it comes in pretty long even though he got them in a small but it's super comfy and really really warm.,5
B00LOD51BA,"These are thick and heavy, but cozy! My wife keeps taking mine. Might need to buy more of them!",5
B00LOD51BA,So unbelievably comfy and extremely well made. I'm a customer for life,5
B00LOD51BA,"It feels awesome as usual!! I ordered mine a little big by accident but regardless it still fits pretty good, you can never go wrong with proclub!",5
B00LOD51BA,Just as described! Such great quality,5
B00LOD51BA,Warmth,5
B00LOD51BA,Very comfy and wide. The fabric is thick and they are bit heavy.,4
B00LOD51BA,"Liked the heavey weight, design and material. Dislikes shrinks in the washer and had to order another pair after that. Could make lenght longer by 1 inche due to shrinkage.",3
B00LOD51BA,AMAZON TOLD ME THEY WERE DELIVERED.  THEY WERE NOT.  THEY SHOWED UP ON MY DOORSTEP ABOUT 36 HOURS LATER.  Missed the birthday party but my grandson is wearing them now and LOVES these pants.  THANK YOU!,5
B00LOD51BA,Just as described,5
B00LOD51BA,Glad to have received these pants!! Best thing ever!! Most comfortable sweats!! Thanks for having them available!!,5
B00LOD51BA,The quality of the product received does not match that as described.  Description states heavy weight cargo sweatpants.  My first pair of ProClub were made of a much higher quality material and heavier in weight.  Would not recommend purchasing this product.,3
B00LOD51BA,Should have more colors choice,5
B00LOD51BA,It's comfortable,5
B00LOD51BA,The pic shows 2 pairs same size and grey one is after washing and black is unwashed one. The quality is very good other than the shrinkage,3
B00LOD51BA,I had ordered another pair prior to this. Both are exactly as expected and wanted. These pants are great I'm 5'6 160 lbs n medium fits great. They are quite baggy but well..that was the point.,5
B00LOD51BA,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              Es comodo confor,5
B00LOD51BA,"They fit great and are heavy so winter time he will be using them a lot more. They are super soft ,comfortable and the colors were just as it showed online , I think they are totally worth the money",5
B00LOD51BA,good design but not good for cold wind,3
B00LOD51BA,Definitely worth the money. Best sweatpants I've ever owned.,5
B00LOD51BA,These pants are very thick and very durable.  My son already wants me to buy another color because he's washing the two pair he has already and pretty much only wants to wear these pants to school.  They are quite warm.  Good for the winter.,5
B00LOD51BA,Size fits perfectly. They are made with the best quality materials and are thicker than I thought they would be. Priced right.,5
B00LOD51BA,i like these especially when it's cold ands i don't want to get ready it's like wearing a blanket on your legs,5
B00LOD51BA,"My son loves these pants. Price is a bit high, but these are so perfect for husky boys/teens, and the quality speaks for itself",5
B00LOD51BA,"I absolutely love them, they fit so perfectly and I love the style and color. The functionality is great along with how thick and cozy it is!",5
B00LOD51BA,Fit my 13 year old baggy but she liked them 99 lbs but my son 12 tried them on too and they fit him too135 lbs not as baggy but he liked the fit they are thick like workman type thick clothing,5
B00LOD51BA,Comfortable pants,5
B00LOD51BA,"These looked really nice until I washed them in cold water on the gentle cycle.I washed them with nothing else.There was lint balls Everywhere on the outside of these sweats.It seems that all sweats are no good anymore because they all have this issue.I would Never buy these again and it's hard for me to say that because I thought I had finally found a good pair of sweats.If it wasn't for all the lint balls, these would be the best sweats I have ever bought.UPDATE: I used 1/2 of my lint roller sheets to get all the fuzz balls off the outside of these sweats. For the price of these, one shouldn't have to do that.",3
B00LOD51BA,Muy bonitos,5
B00LOD51BA,"The pockets and thickness of the sweatpants are awesome.  It doesn't fade too much after the first 2 washes but I think it will fade after a few more. That aside, the fit is perfect,  it's very comfortable and its stretchy. No zipper just the drawstrings at the waist. Its good for working out and if you want to lounge or go run errands!",5
B00LOD51BA,"My teen son wears these pants. A GREAT change from jeans. His appearance is neat & clean. Very very high quality, made very well.  I bought a couple more in other colors.",5
B00LOD51BA,Got for my grandson he really likes them quality is good size runs small so order bigger size then normal,5
B00LOD51BA,Nice quality and sizing,5
B00LOD51BA,This very good i got this for My son,5
B00LOD51BA,they brake,3
B0059CVERW,Good product,5
B0059CVERW,They came in perfect,5
B0059CVERW,Bought for my grandson who wears a 13 size shoe.,5
B0059CVERW,The socks are very comfortable to wear.,5
B0059CVERW,"These socks wear very well. Good quality, good fit, a little snug like a compression sock.",5
B0059CVERW,Feel a little tighter than the ones I buy at the store but still they are just nike socks so not much of a difference.,4
B0059CVERW,Excelente producto.,5
B0059CVERW,"I didn't expect to be writing a review about socks, but I really love these socks. I have had sneaker or athletic socks that were very low, but very thin and not that comfortable. I have had higher socks that I don't wear anymore. I have had loose fitting socks that moved around my foot made by some no name brand. These socks fit perfectly, have ribbed support under the heel, and around the middle of the foot. They socks allow my foot to breathe, are soft, and are very comfortable.  This Dri-Fit is a great product by Nike.",5
B0059CVERW,There good quality socks however the price is too high.,5
B0059CVERW,Great fit. True to size,5
B0059CVERW,These are NOT genuine Nike dri-fit socks. They are thinner and do not have the same support. They should NOT be priced the same as the genuine ones.Other than that a solid sock but just not what is advertised.,3
B0059CVERW,Love these socks,5
B0059CVERW,Like these,5
B0059CVERW,just purchased. I love the cotton texture.. The item feels premium..,5
B0059CVERW,Exactly as described.,5
B0059CVERW,"they are very thin and do not feel premium at all. additionally, after about 5 washes after heavy use, they started to tear at the heel. most of my pairs have holes in them now. probably the worst quality socks i've ever purchased",2
B0059CVERW,My son loves these socks. We always buy them. Good for his basketball activities.,5
B0059CVERW,Socks?,5
B0059CVERW,Comfy and durable,5
B0059CVERW,"my feet know and can't wait to wear these socks. I only own this type of sock. The feel and comfort are amazing!! This is the only sock I wear to work. I bought the pack with the darker colors, once my feet and socks saw them, they ""straight up"" fainted.",5
B0059CVERW,"So I had bought this product before and I enjoyed the quality, this time around when I ordered it the product was different, less material and did not fit same way as when I purchased it even though I supposedly ordered the exact same thing. Not sure how to feel about now cause I already tried them on.",3
B0059CVERW,I love these! They are really comfortable and look great. Just be gentle when handling them because they can tear with not much effort.,4
B0059CVERW,They hold the heat horribly and make you feet sweat,2
B0059CVERW,"Ordered these because the picture has the dri fit on the toes, got them today and they do not have that on there.",2
B0059CVERW,"These socks are not the Dri-Fit versions, so dumb",2
B0059CVERW,He keeps ordering more. Good quality.,5
B0059CVERW,Fit perfectly,5
B0059CVERW,"This is a horrible product, and it took way too long to arrive.",1
B0059CVERW,Best high ankle socks I have bought in a while . Washes well and maintains white .,5
B0059CVERW,"these socks last through anything and wash very well. they are a little long and expensive, but they're gonna last you a long time.",4
B0059CVERW,These sacks go higher on the calf than it looks like in the picture.,5
B0059CVERW,My granddaughter requested these so I bought them for her. SHE LOVES THEM!!!,5
B0059CVERW,Boys will be boys and my teenage makes that statement true more times than not. These socks hold up. He is super active and I love the durability of them. They last quite a while for my overactive teen.,5
B0059CVERW,"Sadly, as with most other things, these just are no longer made with enough thread/material to last. I purchased these back in 2019, they were much thicker than the ones I just purchased. Same exact ones too.It really sucks because socks in general need some good thickness in the soles or they get holes in them real fast. Furthermore they are so much more expensive than they used to be. So for more money we get less well made socks.Also I question if these are authentic Nike. The logos look kind off compared to my older ones. I wont buy these again. I need socks that are made with higher quality and sole thickness.",1
B0059CVERW,My son plays basketball and he loves these socks! He says they are really comfortable and breathable. Will buy more.,5
B0059CVERW,"I was trying to exactly match my daughter's favorite socks (she has size 5-6 women's feet). We had trouble with the ""kids sizes"" so tried the adult. They are still too big (not small despite the label). But we kept them because  -- these are HIGH-QUALITY socks.",3
B0059CVERW,i order socks through here rather than nike and they are comfortable,5
B0059CVERW,Fits me better than my 10yo,4
B0059CVERW,Bought the white pair for one grandson and the black pair for another grandson. They both agreed the socks were the real Nike socks and just what they wanted. Apparently there are socks that are socks with the Nike logo but fall apart with washings or wear out quickly.,5
B0059CVERW,My son loves these socks for reasons we haven't discussed.  What I found was that they seemed somewhat small so I gave them to my teenage boy.  I gave these a better score based on my sons approval of them.  Buy bigger than you normally would...,4
B0059CVERW,"I am a kid of the 90's. I don't understand why these socks are trendy. My son wears them with shorts, and I just seriously don't understand how hat looks good. But he likes them. And they're nice socks. So giving them a good rating.",5
B0059CVERW,"Just like any other pair of white Nike socks. Super bright and soft, pack of 6",5
B0059CVERW,"These aren't the ones I thought they were. They are Nike Dri-fit, but apparently there is a lower brand of these socks. Unlike the usual ones I buy, these are not labeled for left and right and are universal in fit. Additionally, these fit much tighter and seem to be constructed much thinner. They were cheaper than the others, but I wouldn't buy them again.",3
B0059CVERW,"These are not the same styling of the Nike Dri Fit cushion crew socks that have been wearing for the last 5 years, and I just purchased some more from a local shoe store a few months ago.  These are thinner, courser, and have dark black print of the Nike swoosh and the Dri Fit.  My old ones that I love have grey swoosh and Dri-Fit print.  These are not as cushiony as the previous ones, There is more of the mesh portion to the sock.  As well the arch support is designed differently, and they are not left/right specific.  I am returning and hoping that I can find the previous style.",2
B0059CVERW,"They are for a very athletic 15 year old, and they get a lot of wear and tear! They have certainly held up very well.",5
B0059CVERW,Almost $30 is a little pricey for socks but they are great quality and last for at least as long as you would expect for use by a teenage boy!,5
B0059CVERW,"Original Nike socks, comfortable and well made. elastic stays tight. Does seem to stain easily with dirt, so don't use these for dirty work.",5
B0059CVERW,When you pay to price for top brands and you get this! My daughter is so disappointed,1
B0059CVERW,Sent me wrong size.  Will not return (not worth effort).  Will give to friend.  Otherwise I like this style.,2
B0059CVERW,My pack arrived and they fit small. Makes me feel like I have huge feet if these are large.,4
B0059CVERW,Just what I was looking for,5
B0059CVERW,Little snug but good socks,5
B0059CVERW,Nike Socks fit my feet the best.,4
B0059CVERW,Fit,5
B0059CVERW,These are counterfeit!!!! Returned for refund. Poor quality. Do not buy!!,1
B0059CVERW,Leaves feet sweaty no wicking material whatsoever,1
B0059CVERW,good,4
B0059CVERW,My son is a senior in high school and is very active playing varsity football and baseball throughout high school.  These are the only socks he'll wear.  They are comfortable and keep his feet as dry as they can be during his daily practices.,5
B0059CVERW,"Several years ago I had gotten these Nike Dri-Fit black in large and they were great. I wanted more and ordered some, again in large.  They're now 2-3 inches shorter in length and require mores stretching to fit the foot.Nike cutting corners.  Disappointing.",3
B0059CVERW,Good quality,4
B0059CVERW,My granddaughter loves everything about  them. She plays JV Volleyball and wears everything Nike!,5
B0059CVERW,No longer made with left and right foot indicators and not as cushiony as before. One less star,4
B0059CVERW,"Love them, super soft and good support.",5
B0059CVERW,Disliked because of the fit...liked because I was able to give it to my 10 year old grandson... he was able to use it for all his football practices...,5
B0059CVERW,"We love these socks! I recommend not cutting corners when buying socks. You spend your entire day and many hours with your socks wrapped around your feet, why not spend a little more and get quality socks like these.",5
B0059CVERW,"My previous Nike socks were a bit minimal at 74% cotton, comfort wise.  Thin does not mean wicking, and more polester means less breathing and more sweating. Maybe marginally ok if worn with sandals only, not shoes.  Cheers",1
B0059CVERW,My daughter was quite satisfied with these Nike basketball socks.,5
B0059CVERW,Great quality,4
B0059CVERW,Items were not what was advertised.  They are not dri fit material,1
B0059CVERW,Displays an image as if they are dri-fit socks but they are not.,1
B0059CVERW,Perfect fit and comfortable,5
B0059CVERW,Grandsons gift just what I was expecting,5
B0059CVERW,"These are no where near as good as the Nike dri-fit socks I got at Kohls.  There is an obvious difference in quality and sizing.  The good socks have a red ""L"" and ""R"" stitched into them.  These do not.  They are far too tight and do not do a good job of keeping my feet dry and comfortable.  I do not know if these are fakes or just a different style, but find the ones with red letter stitching and get those even if they cost more.",2
B0059CVERW,"Product came fast, these socks are amazing and are very durable!!  I workout every day and I've had these socks for a while, and they still look brand-new every time I put them on",5
B0059CVERW,My son loves these socks. My only concern is that the bottom of the socks wear out easily.,4
B0059CVERW,These are not authentic. Avoid if looking for the real thing,1
B0059CVERW,I love wearing these socks,5
B0059CVERW,I didn't realize how uncomfortable my old socks were until I got this 6-pack,5
B0059CVERW,My grandson liked these socks,5
B0059CVERW,ok,4
B0059CVERW,The seller sent the correct item. The socks are good quality and are authentic Nike socks as described.,5
B0059CVERW,Nice,5
B0059CVERW,"very soft, and i love these socks!",5
B0059CVERW,"These six replaced exact same six I purchased several years ago.  They wore well, fit right and I am perfectly satisfied.  Good six and I love the ease of shopping thru Amazon.",5
B0059CVERW,Previously I purchased these socks from the store and was so thrilled when I seen them on Amazon.  These are the best socks and I won't spend money on any other sock!,5
B00AECT1ZE,"Well made and very comfortable.  They sit about 2 inches above the ankle and may run a wee bit large.  Do not order more than your regular size.  My husband wears a 14 and the XL was more than enough, probably L would have worked too.  These socks do not squeeze his foot like other socks.  Not too tight not too loose.  Wash and dry perfectly.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"I wear a pair of these socks to work every day in the summer with my shorts and safety shoes.  They lasted three full summers before they started showing thin spots, but there are still no holes.  They've remained absorbent and comfortable.They've been worn a full day (about 10 hours), washed, and dried about 60-70 times for each sock (one wear per week over a 20-24 week summer season, times three summers) and they've held up this long, and for the price that's impressive.They're comfortable, have good cushioning, and I liked them so well that I ordered the same socks again today.  It's a great value because these socks have outlasted their price point.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"Great socks. Cheap enough, holds up well over several years. Would buy again!",5
B00AECT1ZE,"Dickies won't disappoint, if you're looking for socks. They have the latest ankle and shoe/boot cut socks. The functional ankle cut makes these socks easy to take on and off. They are made from high quality polyester blend. They are slip resistant, they are functional for either sport or play. From work or home, they are warm and toasty. Well worth the money, a must have product.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"I've been wearing one style sock for a while, but they were turning ""upside down"" on my feet (so the sole was on top of my foot) - it drove me crazy. A friend said she bought Dickies socks and liked them so I decided to give them a try.They are comfortable, WARM, and stay put! I wish they had ankle socks but the quarter are still really good.",5
B00AECT1ZE,My husband finds these socks very comfortable with sneakers.  They slip on his foot with ease.bb They wash beautifully & he is glad we could purchase them on Amazon. Good value. Very happy.,5
B00AECT1ZE,"Like everyone else has said in the reviews, these are great quality socks. My only criticism is the sizes need to be adjusted. I am 11.5wide, so I ordered the 12. The 12 is just a bit too big on the toes. But the 9-12 XL are too small for me.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"Im sure Im weird this way, but I only buy these specific socks - no worries about making pairs. The reason is, while I find them very comfortable, they heel get holes in about a year. So I chuck out the ones with the holes and make pairs with the socks that dont have holes lol.I do like them, wish the heels didnt wear through so fast though.",4
B00AECT1ZE,"Love the warmth it gives, not the color I ordered but it'll do.",5
B00AECT1ZE,Best crew socks Ive found.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Exactly as described. Very comfortable sock and the fit is perfect.,5
B00AECT1ZE,"These socks are very comfortable, well made and hold up to many washings.  I'm switching from FOTL, a little more expensive but so much better quality and comfort.",4
B00AECT1ZE,"exactly the type of socks that i like. my feet tend to get wet with other socks, but with these they maintain dryness longer and they are soo comfy too.",5
B00AECT1ZE,Nice socks,5
B00AECT1ZE,I wear size 13 shoes - These XL socks fit amazingly well. I have now purchased them multiple times.,5
B00AECT1ZE,"very nice ,good fit, last longer than my goldtoe",5
B00AECT1ZE,"These would probably be great for lace up work boots. They are more like 1/2 crew rather than 1/4 crew.I wear men's 12EEE. Bought the large, but they were too big. They slid down my foot when I wore them with sneakers.",4
B00AECT1ZE,Bought for my son - he said they fit great.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Kids always need socks.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Awesome,5
B00AECT1ZE,My husband wears size 13 extra wide shoes. Socks arealways tight and end up with holes after one or two wears.  These XXL socks fit perfectly! Great quality and comfortable.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Super Comfortable,5
B00AECT1ZE,These are comfortable socks and fit well. Don't expect to last years though. My first set lasted about a year then the holes were just too big to keep wearing. Buying again because its cheap and it works.,4
B00AECT1ZE,I have wide feet and need the extra size - XL is perfect for my 9 EEE,5
B00AECT1ZE,Ive gotten many socks from diff manufacturers. Most all did not last long at all. These r old fashioned and last.,5
B00AECT1ZE,"I tried these out this past week, they feel great in my hiking boots! I love that they are slightly longer than the average ankle sock, don't like winter air on my ankles and they are very soft on my feet!!!",5
B00AECT1ZE,My feet would get itchy at night after wearing these. Had to move to a different brand,4
B00AECT1ZE,Comfortable socks,4
B00AECT1ZE,"They no longer make cushies in my size and since I have diabetes I need good socks with thick cushions.  These are the best I can find, and since they have wicking material it keeps my feet nice and dry at work.  Very comfortable and helps with the swelling of my feet.  If they were just a bit thicker I would love them more.",5
B00AECT1ZE,2nd time I have ordered these socks in the last 18 months or so. Good quality and good price,4
B00AECT1ZE,"These were exactly what i was looking for, at a great price, very comfy and work great with hightops.",5
B00AECT1ZE,Just what I was looking for. Not too thick to make shoes tight but thick enough to keep feet warm and wear well. Machine washed and dried perfectly with minimal shrinkage even in a hot dryer.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Best work socks for us guys with big feet,5
B00AECT1ZE,"I bought these coming from wearing Hanes X-Temp socks for years. These are about the same quality in my opinion. The price point is good. These are a bit thicker than the Hanes X-Temp.What I like:They're comfortable enough.They're slightly thicker.I think they're a bit better at preventing blisters.What I don't like:They're pretty big. I think if you can size down if you're in the middle of the listed sizes.Overall, they're pretty good. If you're looking for bargain socks, they are totally fine. About on par for the Hanes X-Temp.",4
B00AECT1ZE,These were nicely packaged and came right of the box fresh and clean. My foot size is 13 male and these fit quite nicely and are durable. I am happy with my purchase.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Good thick socks. Warm and comfy. Best for cool or cold weather.,5
B00AECT1ZE,"This stuff is real nice and comfy, and you can't beat the price.",5
B00AECT1ZE,Good for circulation. Thickness is medium. I can wear with fitness sneakers. Comfortable on hard floors. My go to sock.,5
B00AECT1ZE,like the sox but the suggested size xxl were way to big for my size 12 shoe,4
B00AECT1ZE,I love dickies socks. Just wanted some color this time. Not quit as comfortable as the black ones different Cloth,5
B00AECT1ZE,I buy these for my husband . He likes them a lot.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Great socks order for my son he has big feet good if you have a hard time finding socks for people that need bigger socks,5
B00AECT1ZE,All good,5
B00AECT1ZE,It's for my dad. he has a lot of different brands of socks. but always make it smell. only Dickies socks he wears and nothing. my dad bought a lot of this Dickies socks. and wear and switch every 3 months.,5
B00AECT1ZE,The only downside is your feet get black fuzzies when using them new.  But does the job!,5
B00AECT1ZE,These are perfect for my man. Thank you!,5
B00AECT1ZE,They fit great,5
B00AECT1ZE,This sock is good except for thickness. If it would be slightly thick then it would be good. It doesnt smell thats the good part.,4
B00AECT1ZE,They fit and wear amazingly. Long lasting,5
B00AECT1ZE,This is my second purchase of this item. They fit true to size and are excellent at moisture control. They keep your feet cool and dry for the entire day.,5
B00AECT1ZE,My husband loves this brand of sox we threw out all the others and will only buy thisbrand from now on,5
B00AECT1ZE,"I have huge (size 14eee) feet AND I'm type II diabetic, so good, comfy socks are a must. I could even wear these to bed if I were so inclined.....they're that nice. I'll definitely be buying more of these.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"Bought these for my son to use for work, he says they're very comfortable and they wash up well.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"This items is perfect, great price and quality.  The product is comfortable and stays in place.",5
B00AECT1ZE,My husband loves them!,5
B00AECT1ZE,Love them,5
B00AECT1ZE,They don't like the dryer but are still useable,4
B00AECT1ZE,The last few orders seem to wear through on the heels faster than normal.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Comfortable on long walks 5 miles + and fit true to size. I wear a 16 EEEE. Medium thickness.,5
B00AECT1ZE,ok works good,5
B00AECT1ZE,These have been very comfortable and have lasted very well. I walk all over the place and these are barely wearing down. They're solid. Will probably buy again when the time comes.,4
B00AECT1ZE,"these are pretty good overall, but I felt the material was a bit thin compared to others I have from the same brand.For shipping they just put them in a clear plastic bar with a label - with all the package theft going on seems like they should at least put it in a paper bag",4
B00AECT1ZE,"Great value. Nice cushion, perfect tightness.",5
B00AECT1ZE,My son loves it. Good quality,5
B00AECT1ZE,"Have not washed/dried yet, but they feel just right out of the package. Not loose on my foot, but not compressing my foot. I had tried some from another brand and Straight out of the package. They were already slightly compressing, my foot, and the reviews on that one said there was a lot of shrinkage after a wash/dry cycle. If there is significant shrinkage and compressing on my foot, I will try and update my review. So far incredibly pleased with the fit and thickness. (Which is about middle of the road, not too thin and not overly thick)",5
B00AECT1ZE,i love these socks,5
B00AECT1ZE,Very comfortable and your feet stay cool,5
B00AECT1ZE,No seriously it will show dick sometimes. Very warm and comfortable.,4
B00AECT1ZE,"These are comfortable socks that do fairly well at keeping my feet dry.  I was disappointed in the colors though.  I thought I was getting bright royal blue socks.  Instead the ""denim"" color is basically navy, and I have to squint to tell this difference between them and my older faded black socks.",4
B00AECT1ZE,"We really favor the Dickies brand. They are durable and comfortable. Also, the option for extended sizes is definitely a ""plus"" when buying socks in our family. Extended sizes are not available in all brands.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"OverallThese socks are really comfortable. Are they the best? No. But they are great socks and have a 45% cotton and 54% polyester ratio and that's what I love about them. It's rare to find a sock with almost a 50/50 equal blend. You either have way too much polyester or way too much cotton. I feel like these are almost perfect.WorkThese stay comfortable and keep my feet warm and dry for 12+ hours. I work at a car manufacturing plant and I'm constantly walking. 5+ miles everyday of walking and these are still comfortable at the end of the day.ExerciseYou can exercise in these and be fine after your workout. Should you? Idk. That's up to you. I've done fine before with these. Try it out. See what happens.OutdoorsIf you are out in the hot sun a lot, these might heat up. I do all the yardwork while wearing these in steel toe boots and it feels fine after. Sure my feet are a little warmer than I'd like but that really isn't a problem. It's just me being picky. They still stay comfortable despite how warm my feet get.IndoorsI'm practically always wearing these indoors to keep my feet warm and also because they are really comfortable. Sometimes I forget that I am even wearing socks.HIstory:Bought my first pair of these in August 2021 and I loved them so much in February 2022 I bought 12 more pairs of these. Out of all 18 pairs I have 1 single sock with a small hole in the ankle portion of the sock. Most likely due to me pulling a stray string out or pulling the sock on to forcefully.In ConclusionIf you made it this far. Just buy a pack of 6 of these to give them a trial and see what you feel about them. Don't just take the comments word for it. You have to really just try these on and use them and see how you like them.",5
B00AECT1ZE,"I'm impressed. Supportive but not tight.  They feel like they will hold up better than the Hanes I've been using, I like the Hanes but the Dickies feel more ""heavy duty"".  I wear size 12, so I'm on the cusp of two different sizes options, they did shrink slightly after first wash, so when I order another set I'll go with the size up for a little more wiggle room.",5
B00AECT1ZE,These socks are comfortable and slightly thick.  They keep my feet warm.  Wash well and keep their shape.,5
B00AECT1ZE,"Bought these because I've had them in the past and found them to be soft and wear well.I had switched to a different brand for work socks for a few years, but missed the softness of these Dickies.I found these to be very soft, but first wash and they pilled up horribly. Also they leave a lot of line between my toes even after a couple wash cycles. Here's hoping they hold up, but they definitely aren't the same quality as they used to be.",3
B00AECT1ZE,It fits comfortably. It is not too tight or loose. It is breathable.,5
B00AECT1ZE,Great absorbency and snug on the foot. Comfortable and well fitted,5
B00AECT1ZE,Se ajustan bien al pie y al calzado deportivo.,4
B00AECT1ZE,"Good socks, good price",5
B00AECT1ZE,Comfortable,5
B00AECT1ZE,On the thicker side of shoes but that's not a bad thing comfortable for basic socks,4
B00AECT1ZE,These were just ok.,4
B00AECT1ZE,Nice socks,5
B00AECT1ZE,"My last socks were 6-12... Terribly small to say the least as I wear a 10.5 wide shoe. THANK YOU, for making at least 3 sizes. The 9-12 are perfect! I also like that you have a few color options, thanks again!",5
B00AECT1ZE,Fits my grandson perfect,5
B00AECT1ZE,"Do socks need to be pretty? Do they need to feel premium? If you answered yes to either of those questions, these socks are not for you. Listen, they are cotton, hold up well after a few washes, and you can wear them with shorts or pants. Beyond that, you don't need me to tell you much of anything. They are socks. They perform sock like functions.",4
B00AECT1ZE,They fit well.,5
B07PMTKK34,Great material awesome fit men and women clothes plus normal price point,5
B07PMTKK34,Pants are fine but the zippers at the bottom of the legs are too short to enable pulling over shoes. So you have to take your shoes off to remove pants. Not ideal for warmup pants that you want to remove while working out.,4
B07PMTKK34,These pants are a great quality. The fit is as I expected it to be. They are super soft and comfortable. They wash well also!,5
B07PMTKK34,These are a nice lightweight athletic pant.  They are very comfortable and look great.  I would definitely recommend them.,5
B07PMTKK34,"They are a decent thickness to the material and overall very comfortable.My issue is with the sizing.I have an athletic build and am 6'2""I ordered a large and the fit around the waist and butt are as expected.The problem is they are short and stop just above my ankles.It looks like I am avoiding a flood.I have to stretch them each time before I put them on and can't put them in the dryer without looking like I'm wearing capri pants.",3
B07PMTKK34,Love the feel of these. I simply wear them in casual settings. No issues with size or color. Excellent quality!,5
B07PMTKK34,They fit well,5
B07PMTKK34,runs a little big at 3xl  probably could have got away with 2xl  so maybe go a size smaller if you want a more straight leg fix there a little baggy but 9/10 would but again,4
B07PMTKK34,"The pants are well made and keep me warm. I was hoping the leg cuff zippers went high enough so the pants could be removed with shoes still on, but they are very short. Makes it easier to get your foot out, but you have to remove your shoe.",4
B07PMTKK34,"Muy buen calentador muy bonito y queda muy bien, el largo de las piernas solo muy largo",4
B07PMTKK34,Like this style pants. Good for blocking cold winds as long as not too cold. Wears well.,4
B07PMTKK34,They were great,4
B07PMTKK34,"These pants look good, but they are poly pants and have very little flexibility in the legs and waist.",4
B07PMTKK34,"WE NEVER KNOW WHAT COUNTRY MAKES THE CLOTHES WE BUY ONLINE. AMERICAN MEN ARE SIZED DIFFERENTLY THAN CHINESE OR JAPANESE OR TAIWANESE.A L IN AMERICA IS A XL OR XXL IN THOSE COUNTRIES.  BUT UNDERARMOUR IS TRUE TO SIZE AND AMERICAN MADE I DO BELIEVE. IF NOT, THE QUALITY CONTROL IS EXCELLENT. GREAT PAIR OF WARM-UPS.",4
B07PMTKK34,My husband loves these pants.  He does a lot of long walks for exercise and wear these every time.,5
B07PMTKK34,Proper fit,4
B07PMTKK34,Excelente producto,5
B07PMTKK34,Bought these for my bro in law for Christmas & he loves them!,5
B07PMTKK34,My son is very thin and tall. He likes to wear crocks with no socks and I was sick of seeing his ankles. These are perfect. No stores carry Small Tall in stock.,5
B07PMTKK34,"Very lightweight material,  more summer weight.  Pants run long.",4
B07PMTKK34,Amazing lengthReally tall,5
B07PMTKK34,"I love the material, fits small i would get a bigger size to fit more comfortably.",4
B07PMTKK34,- purchased 3 pair - happy Amazon has this available -,5
B07PMTKK34,These gym pants look and feel great. The best that I have ever purchased.,5
B07PMTKK34,The rise in the crouch should be increased. It is not sufficient in the 2XL.,4
B07PMTKK34,My husband's favorite loungewear pants. Little zipper at the bottom is nice. Comfortable.,5
B07PMTKK34,My grandson loves these pants!,5
B07PMTKK34,Great fit and look really nice on.,5
B07PMTKK34,"Bought for cycling, not tight enough around the ankle for it. In fact a bit loose. Wouldn't make the pants a bit more versitile.Quality and comfort are great. They just are loud and a big baggy around the ankle.",4
B07PMTKK34,Love them,5
B07PMTKK34,"Looks great fits perfect, so comfortable great value for the price",5
B07PMTKK34,Best quality/ Fast shipping,5
B07PMTKK34,Great quality,5
B07PMTKK34,"Don't get me wrong, UnderArmor makes great active wear. The only problem is that they primarily support athletes. And, even though the make large size products, the active wear does not fit those of us who do not seek to achieve the perfect body.I can wear a 3 XL size in many brands, but the 4 XL I ordered struggles to allow me to bend over without exposing my backside and the legs are a little too tight in the thighs.But, they are nicely made and I'm keeping them to encourage my goal of self improvement.Good luck to you all looking for great active wear, but big and tall non-Triathletes beware!",3
B07PMTKK34,Well made product,5
B07PMTKK34,Sizing Beast in the business UA makes stuff that fits and last,5
B07PMTKK34,04-May,4
B07PMTKK34,"Pants looked nice online, but they are scratchy and not very comfortable. As wind breakers they are fine for a quick run, but not for everyday use.",3
B07PMTKK34,holding up well to weight lifting and washing,5
B07PMTKK34,"I am very happy with this purchase, I wear these pants often and they are comfortable and they look great",5
B07PMTKK34,They are ok but I thought they were fleece,4
B07PMTKK34,I order from this vendor again because the last time I order it was exactly what I wanted the fit is a lose there like track pants space in the pockets and they are comfortable,5
B07PMTKK34,very comfortable,5
B07PMTKK34,The have good quality and fit well.,5
B07PMTKK34,Excellent,5
B07PMTKK34,"These are great pants. Exactly what I was looking for, however, I do not like the design of the zipper at the bottom. It opens up the front of my ankle instead of on the side. I also really wish they had at least one back pocket for my phone. Otherwise, they are great!",4
B07PMTKK34,I really like the pants - good price - washed well,5
B07PMTKK34,"I am only 5'10"", but I have long legs. I was torn between the large, and the large-tall sizes. Based on the information on their site, the large-tall is for people much larger than I, so I got large. While standing, they look like they fit fine, but the second I sit or bend my knee at all, the bottom goes up my leg substantially. I have been wearing the same sweatpants for 10 years because brands can't make stuff like they used to. Either too short or too long. Also, not a fan of the material at all.",3
B07PMTKK34,My boyfriend loves the brand and the quality. The only thing is the netting inside if it was removed completely completely that be a plus he does enjoy these and wears them almost daily.,4
B07PMTKK34,Great find for the tall person 30x34 -  Not available in stores- and affordable,5
B07PMTKK34,"These workout pants could be good, but not in my case.  I cannot recommend.  I see a number of positive reviews and negative (like mine) noting the same issues.The bad. 1) Fit is strange; XL is a small XL; fit is OK at waist but too short a length for XL, 2) These do not fit well over workout shorts, nor do they easily slip over another fabric if you are slipping them off at the gym, 3) the 6-inch zippers at the leg bottoms need to be twice as long; nice feature, but leg bottoms are small and 6"" zipper  doesn't come close to opening enough to fit over shoes.  4) these pants are fully lined with a loose mesh liner, likely to make them more comfortable against your skin; however, pushing your foot down a leg will catch the mesh at the bottom; you might fall over; you have to sit and unwrap your foot.I did return this product",4
B07PMTKK34,"My husband loves these cozy pants, they are very stylish and comfortable with the perfect material. I would purchase again. Thanks",5
B07PMTKK34,These pants would have been fine if they fit. Buy 2 sizes bigger than you expect.,3
B07PMTKK34,holds up well after a couple of years use and washing for physical therapy,5
B07PMTKK34,"They called these warm when they are thinner than their regular sweat pants with a thin open-holed mesh liner inside that a slight breeze could get through. I bought these so that I could stay warm on my ride to work and then remove them after arriving at my job, without having to remove my shoes. And the zippers at the cuff/ ankles were the other reason for getting these. I expected the pants to be able to be removed over their own brand of shoe after opening the zippers at the ankles. But unfortunately I still had to take off my shoes to get the pants off after trying them on. If you want something to wear to workout in and not get too overly hot, then these so-called fleece are for you. If you want something that is going to keep you warm while out in 50 degree Fahrenheit weather that you could take off over your shoes when you get to your work or workout, then you better find something different from this.",2
B07PMTKK34,"These run pretty long unlike most sweatpants that are 30"" or 32"" in length.  I originally ordered talls for both my husband (6'3"") and son (6""5).  Neither needed a tall (both wear 34-36"" long pants).  My son didn't like the feel of the fabric.  Ordered normal L size for husband and fit great in length and sizing - he wears them regularly and really likes them.",4
B07PMTKK34,"Best exercise pants ever. The fit and the look are excellent. Quality fabric and very comfortable. Perfect for the gym, or a stroll.",5
B07PMTKK34,"The netting in the legs catches on my feet making putting them on a bit of a struggle, other than that I like these.",4
B07PMTKK34,Comfortable good fit  and material,5
B07PMTKK34,"These are well-made but a bit odd in that they are mesh lined over the full length. That, and the very thin fabric, makes them go 'woosh-woosh' as you walk. Other than that they are comfortable, long, and roomy.  I like a more supple, slightly heavier fabric and will not buy them again.",4
B07PMTKK34,Perfect fit.,5
B07PMTKK34,Lightweight and comfortable.  Washes and wears well,5
B07PMTKK34,Fit and look great comfortable,5
B07PMTKK34,Good quality for the price,5
B07PMTKK34,The pants were made well. The reason sent them back was because they did not feel good on me.,3
B07PMTKK34,"Quality product, very light and breathable.But if you have a thick rear end or thighs, get a size larger.",4
B07PMTKK34,"If you're a skinny little girly guy these are probably fine. If you have the body of a man, you'll probably feel quite limited in your movements while wearing these and feel like they're going to tear while doing anything more than standing still or slowly strolling around.",2
B07PMTKK34,The pants are comfortable.,5
B07PMTKK34,All good,5
B07PMTKK34,Its a bit restrictive for me when i lift my legs might try a bigger size,4
B07PMTKK34,Problem. Ordered 4xl..these were ok but needed more space in hips and legs Called in explained problem..was told 4xlb was what i needed 4xlbig..ask them to send them to me then I would return the 4xl pants.received 3.pair but they were the same size. Now i have 6 pair.The legs and but are too small..I guess i will have to keep them. They fit my waist but I can't pull them up because legs and waist aren't big enoughI am wheel chair bound however i do stand  to transfer  from chair to car..can't afford to buy any more pantsO,3
B07PMTKK34,"I saw these pants at a local athletic wear store and liked the quality and weight of the material.  As with most things I see in the store I decided to hit the internet and see who has the best price.  Amazon was by far the best price vs. other authorized Under Armour retailers and the best thing was that Amazon had the Medium Tall size which is very hard to find.  Quality is really nice on these, nice and light weight, quiet material, and zipper ankle bottoms.  They are perfect for fall and spring weather when it gets cool.  I will likely by a few extra pairs I like them so much.  Thanks Amazon for another great purchase!",5
B07PMTKK34,Like the material and the zippered leg opening. Runs large.,4
B07PMTKK34,Good fit. Friend says it looks like a PE teacher pants.,5
B07PMTKK34,Pants were soft and looked great,5
B07PMTKK34,Great quality fit was good at waist but the length was too long and falls under my shoe heels,4
B07PMTKK34,Liked the color did not like the fit overall ok,4
B07PMTKK34,I love these pants. They are very comfortable and fit well. My son wears lulu everything and I prefer these to his which are of similar construction.,5
B07PMTKK34,"I loved the material and the pockets and zippers. Husband, not so much. Too late to return.",4
B07PMTKK34,"These are well made and fit perfectly, as I am 5'9"" and 165 lbs.  (large) They are exactly how workout sweats fit 20 years ago. Wide leg, zipper on the side and string around the waist. If you are old school, get yourself a pair. No skinny pants here !",4
B07PMTKK34,It was very good.  Good zipper pants.,4
B00LSRU2JS,"These Hanes Men's Cotton, Moisture-wicking white t-shirts are a staple in my husband's wardrobe.

B00LSRU2JS,Easy cotton feel.,5
B00LSRU2JS,"Pretty decent t-shirts. Nowdays a bit thin, used to be beefy",4
B00LSRU2JS,Great fit and great price,5
B00LSRU2JS,I think they run a bit large (personal preference) but I washed them in hot water and they're just about right now. They feel great too.,5
B00LSRU2JS,Would Recommend. Are nice. Fit well and wears well.,5
B00LSRU2JS,Very think material,3
B00LSRU2JS,"I wear golf shirts exclusively, and when they would develop underarm stains there was no method to get them truly clean again. Even the baking soda / hydrogen peroxide / Dawn dish soap combination would not work, and that's the go-to combo for laundry stain cleaning. I would have to dispose of them when they got too grubby. Undershirts serve 2 purposes, as a ""sweat catcher"" to save the underarms of the outer shirt from staining, and the whiteness actually shows through the outer fabric, making the colors appear noticeably brighter.",5
B00LSRU2JS,"The material for these t-shirts is much better than the previous material.  Just as warm as the previous material, but cooler than the previous material.  The company in the Dominican Republic can't properly separate Large shirts from Large-Tall shirts.  I purchased a package of 6 shirts directly from Haynes and received Large shirts.  I purchased 2 packages of 6 shirts from Amazon and received Large-Tall shirts.  But, they were marked a Large shirts.",4
B00LSRU2JS,Good quality shirts for the price,5
B00LSRU2JS,"These undershirts were low cost, and they provided adequate value for the money.",4
B00LSRU2JS,Great Product- I really like the long tail- it stays under the belt line. I have bought them 2 times,5
B00LSRU2JS,These are the only shirt he wears. If you see his closet you only see these,5
B00LSRU2JS,I bought these for my husband at the same time as another brand.  They fit good & work as an undershirt.,4
B00LSRU2JS,Great bang for your buck with this shirt package!  Fit how you would expect them too.  No issues with the dirty spot from the packaging like others posted about.,5
B00LSRU2JS,n/a,5
B00LSRU2JS,"I returned these because they were much, much thinner than other undershirts I've worn in the past. If you like extremely thin undershirts, then this would be for you and be a 5 star. These also come at a great price point.",4
B00LSRU2JS,comfortable,5
B00LSRU2JS,Perfect!,5
B00LSRU2JS,I sleep in V-neck T-shirts.  This was a great buy compared to the big retail box stores.,5

B00LSRU2JS,Excelente,5
B00LSRU2JS,"Breathable and Lightweight: Keeps you cool and comfortable even during a workout.Dries faster than traditional cotton, ideal for active.",5
B00LSRU2JS,I mean they're men's t-shirts. One problem we encountered was a large black stain on the front of the first one in the plastic bag. It appears to be from the  black portion of the label. I'll hit it with some bleach and see what happens.,3
B00LSRU2JS,Great quality,5
B00LSRU2JS,My husband is very happy with this product!,5
B00LSRU2JS,Better quality than Amazon by far.,4
B00LSRU2JS,Nice fit,5
B00LSRU2JS,"Good fit, nice material",4
B00LSRU2JS,Nice Tee shirts especially for the price would buy again,5
B00LSRU2JS,The best made,5
B00LSRU2JS,The shirts are the usual mid range quality but ok for undershirts. 1 shirt has a hole right out of the package.,3
B00LSRU2JS,"These are thinner than usual, otherwise fine. I didn't realize Hanes has different ""models"" of the same t-shirts! These are thinner than the Comfort*** model and also from the Fruit Loom brands.",3
B00LSRU2JS,"Like these a lot, I order a new set every few months.",5
B00LSRU2JS,"I wanted to find a new v-neck t-shirt for work, and I've been using Hanes for many years, so gave these a shot. Unfortunately even after multiple washes they are still scratchy, this makes me a bit hotter than with my prior ""soft cotton"" T's. Besides that the fit is good, and quality seems fine, but if it's not comfortable on your skin it's not worth it. I needed them so am glad to have them, but won't buy again.",4
B00LSRU2JS,"The materail is very thin. So much so, it is pratically see-through.  If that is what you want, it's perfect for you.  When I need a non-see trough v-neck Tee - I supppse I can put TWO of these on.  I did not send them back, but I may buy a different type that is thick enough to not be a see-through.",3
B00LSRU2JS,Excellent quality proper size,5
B00LSRU2JS,Fits good initially. After a wash they distort/shrink to be too tight in the arm pits,3
B00LSRU2JS,Just what I ordered,5
B00LSRU2JS,"I'm a woman who likes to sleep in sleep shorts or pajama bottoms, with a plain white t-shirt.  I like v-necks because they are more comfortable for me in general, and especially to sleep in.  This 6-pack was priced well, and it fit my needs perfectly.  I ordered based on chest measurement, and hoped the shirts would feel roomy enough... and they do.  They wash & dry perfectly with no shrinkage.I prefer a lower v-neck than this (personally), however this v-neck will be fine for my needs for now.  The next time I buy men's white v-necks for myself, I'll find the brand that is a bit lower cut at the neckline.  Either way, these are great quality shirts to wear as under-shirts or as sleep shirts.*** For the MEN who are reading this ***This v-neck is the perfect cut to wear with your dress shirts, because it allows you to unbutton your top buttons without your undershirt showing.  But it's not ""too"" low-cut, so when your dress shirt IS buttoned all the way up, no one will see the v-neck's lines thru your shirt.  A lower v-neck would show thru your white dress shirt, whereas this v-neck will be more hidden by your ties.Do I recommend this 6-pack?  YES.  For anyone who likes a comfy sleep-t-shirt, and for all men & boys who need under-shirts.  --- A great price,  a great seller,  and so convenient to be able to order it practically overnight via Amazon Prime!",5
B00LSRU2JS,"I'm generally an average height male -- 6ft.  Getting a little thicker around the waist with age.  Typically by the large version of t-shirts and I typically buy the standard collared ones.  Given my increase in girth and my aversion to wearing a t-shirt that barely covers my stomach or risks coming untucked, I decided to step up the XL size.  Figured it would be better to be too big then too small.  Note:  I've generally stuck with Hanes t-shirts but it's a coin-flip to know which ones you are getting.  I've had some great ones and some horrible ones and on the surface, they all seem to have the same branding.  Go figure.Anyhow, I stepped up to XL and I'm sorry I did.  They are definitely wider but not any longer.  Thus, after a single washing, it's like I'm wearing a tutu that comes down to my belly button.  Some might appreciate that look, I do not.I will also throw out that I'm not used to the V-neck.  I normally buy the standard collars but it just feels wrong to wear those with a polo in the middle of summer.  I gotta have the t-shirt because I tend to perspire and don't want to ruin my polos or other collared shirts.  Yet, I don't want to bundle up like it's winter.  Figured the V Neck would give me a little more breathing room.  It does but it feels odd to wear.  I get the sudden urge to drink a Coors light and sit on a couch in my yard.  Somewhat unexplainable.Anyway, like most t-shirts, they shrink quite a bit and quite fast.  They aren't particularly soft and aren't quite long enough after washing.  I'm going back to large and I'll just have to look for the tall version, even though I'm not that tall.",3
B00LSRU2JS,These are ok but they are thin. Not as good as the regular Hanes Undershirts I buy,3
B00LSRU2JS,"Just one of those old fashioned made well, fits well, lasts a long time products. You can't go wrong with these.",5
B00LSRU2JS,The quality of all t-shirts has decreased over the decades.  But nothing seems to last as long any more. These are comfortable and fit well.,4
B00LSRU2JS,Right size,5
B00LSRU2JS,They are great T Shirts but they are pretty thin and my experience with them in the past is that they get holes in them fairly easily.,4
B00LSRU2JS,okay for the price,3
B00LSRU2JS,Excelent,4
B00LSRU2JS,"I love Hanes underwear but their shirts are incredibly weird. The length suggests that it's designed as an undershirt to be tucked into your pants, but if you order your regular size, you'll find it very loose. Typically for an undershirt you'd want something that hugs the body much closer.I ordered a Medium when I typically wear Large shirts. The shirt is functional as an undershirt to keep sweat off your visible layers, but the fit is just odd. The neck hole is cartoonishly large, resulting in a deeper V than any normal person would be comfortable with. It's not a big deal if you're purely using it as an undershirt, but I think if you want to wear this in any visible way, you'll be very disappointed in the appearance.",2
B00LSRU2JS,My Dad loves these,5
B00LSRU2JS,Nice,5
B00LSRU2JS,"I have a lot of these. They are comfortable and hold up fairly well in the commercial laundry machines in our complex. The ones I use for indoor bike riding turn yellow from sweat and tend to wear out faster, but perhaps that's to be expected with heavy use. So I keep a separate set of them for the indoor bike riding.",4
B00LSRU2JS,Excellent Quality.,5
B00LSRU2JS,fit great,5
B00LSRU2JS,This is so soft on my skin and even after it has been washed the texture has not changed at all am glad I made this purchase.,4
B00LSRU2JS,Gift for husband. He loves these. Comfy and last long time,5
B00LSRU2JS,Great price,5
B00LSRU2JS,They fit as I'd like. Body hugging and tight around my arms. Does not bunch up under my clothes as a result.,5
B00LSRU2JS,"My husband loves these undershirts. They are lightweight and perfect under a collared shirt for church, etc.  or under a work shirt as he does sweaty chores around our property. The quality is good. These come as a 6 pack, which is a great value. Highly recommend. Fit is true to size.",5
B00LSRU2JS,Fit good,5
B00LSRU2JS,"These are so thin, one can pretty much see through them. The sleeves are shorter than normal. And on about half of them, the sleeves are not sewn on properly. Like when you buy them at a discount because they are, ""seconds""  or imperfect. I don't expect these to last long.",2
B00LSRU2JS,"Fit very well, and since I wear them every day under my button down shirts, they last for a long time!",4
B00LSRU2JS,Worth the money,5
B00LSRU2JS,Quality good,5
B00LSRU2JS,The only t I wear under my dress shirts.,5
B00LSRU2JS,"The quality is really poor...very THIN fabric, stretches out of shape, neckline ripples..SHRINKS! For years I bought Costco Kirkland brand but they don't carry v neck anymore.  Still looking for a quality v neck...THIS ISN'T IT!",2
B00LSRU2JS,"I've been wearing these shirts for years. But after 6 weeks, the latest T-shirt hems are curling. Very disappointed and will have to look for something different going forward.",2
B00LSRU2JS,"Rough, super thin and not as durable or comfortable as Hanes used to make them. Good price though.",3
B00LSRU2JS,"I was looking for a thin t-shirt for summer, and these were perfect.  One funny thing I noticed was none were the same length.  I washed them right after I received them, hung them on hangers to dry and none were the same length, with a difference of 1"" to 3"".",5
B00LSRU2JS,"Sad these are not as nice as they used to be. I've bought and worn these tees for decades and they have just gone down hill. The material is thin as usual, no iog deal, but it is scratchy even with the huge amount of fabric chemicals they put on the material to try to soften it I imagine (sizing?) Even with several washes before wearing, it still has the greasy feeling and fragrance sizing in it and I am allergic so cannot wear until that is gone. It is also still scratchy instead of soft. I do not wash them with other clothes because whatever is in the material gets into my other clothing. Runs narrower than before as well. I wish Hanes would make 100% real cotton tees like before that did not have all the softeners and chemicals added. (Produced overseas might have something to do with it.) I will be looking for real 100% natural soft cotton tees  that are not treated with anything. For people who don't care about that or are not allergic or have MCS, they will be fine.",3
B00LSRU2JS,Fit is good and material soft and comfortable.,5
B00LSRU2JS,"They just aren't as comfortable as my other hanes shirts, washed them three times and I don't think they're getting any better.",4
B00LSRU2JS,"I bought the same t shirts in the same size several years ago, but the ones I just got are much too big. In particular, they are way too long. I'm not sure why they have changed the sizing so much.",2
B00LSRU2JS,I ordered these because of the long term reliability.  That being said they don't disappoint.  They look and feel great.....as expected.,5
B00LSRU2JS,Very good product for the price.,5
B00LSRU2JS,"I am a medium at 5'10"" 190 pounds.  I purchased a small for a tight fit.  I need a tight fit at underarms to prevent skin on skin rub when exercising.  Also wanted a deep enough V to hide the undershirt when top button of collared shirt is open.  I needed the shirt to be long enough to tuck in without pulling up.  This 100% cotton undershirt is perfect for me in a size small.  I was worried it would be too short, but not at all.Finally, it is priced way better than all of the fancy brands.  I bought 3 packs of 6.",5
B00LSRU2JS,Great fit - Great prices - fast delivery,5
B00LSRU2JS,Great quality and at a affordable price. Very happy with this purchase.,5
B00LSRU2JS,"The shirts are fine, but they said it would be seven of them.  Only the six pack arrived.  I didn't make a big deal out of this, but future buyers should be aware.",4
B00LSRU2JS,Came in extra large.  Probably should've ordered large. Soft and comfortable,5
B00LSRU2JS,Hanes is no longer the company I loved 20 yrs ago.These shirts are 100% cotton but on my sensitive skin felt like sandpaper.Shame on all these name brands making inferior shirts now.,3
B00LSRU2JS,"Comfortable. Washes great, no shrinkage. Great value and quality.",5
B000M25HZ4,"The first thing is comfort. I was looking for socks that offered a great deal of comfort, and these are it. They aren't slip-resistant. I wear a size 10 shoe, so I order a large. It's a perfect fit. Excellent material and quality. Easy washable. I haven't experienced any shrinkage after washing & drying.",5
B000M25HZ4,"I've been using these socks for a few weeks now, and I'm really happy with them. They're comfortable, supportive, and they seem to be holding up well.Here are some of the things I like about these socks:They're made of a soft, breathable fabric that keeps my feet cool and dry.They have a good amount of cushioning in the heel and forefoot, which helps to absorb shock and protect my feet from impact.The arch compression provides a secure fit and helps to prevent my feet from getting tired.They're low-cut, so they don't bunch up or show under my shoes.Overall, I highly recommend these socks. They're a great option for anyone who is looking for comfortable, supportive, and durable socks.Here are some additional benefits of using these socks:They can help to prevent blisters and other foot injuries.They can help to improve circulation and reduce fatigue.They can help to keep your feet warm in cold weather.If you're looking for a pair of socks that will keep your feet comfortable and supported, I highly recommend the adidas Men's Athletic Cushioned Low Cut Socks with Arch Compression for a Secure Fit.Here are some pros and cons of these socks:Pros:ComfortableSupportiveDurableBreathableLow-cutCons:Can be a bit snug for some peopleNot as thick as some other athletic socksOverall, I think these socks are a great option for most people. They're comfortable, supportive, and durable, and they're a good value for the price.",5
B000M25HZ4,Good socks.  Comfortable and moisture wicking.  Held up 6 full days and 4 heavy showers at Disney.,4
B000M25HZ4,"My boyfriend loves these socks the fit just right, very breathable and soft!",5
B000M25HZ4,We order these regularly for my husband. The quality is great and XL size is perfect!,5
B000M25HZ4,"Great product, fits great",5
B000M25HZ4,They're what I wanted. Only negative is getting the zipper started. It's difficult. I fear it may break at some point.,4
B000M25HZ4,My husband wears a size 13 shoe and it is hard to find socks that fit.  These fit very well.,5
B000M25HZ4,Nice material goes on easy,5
B000M25HZ4,I like them. They're comfortable to wear and worth the price.,4
B000M25HZ4,"My grandaughter recieved these socks 3 years ago.  When asked about Christmas list , the socks were his only order.",5
B000M25HZ4,Nice set.  Wash well,5
B000M25HZ4,This was my grandsons gift he loved them; his statement these are so comfortable.,5
B000M25HZ4,Much softer than Niki,5

B000M25HZ4,Nice,5
B000M25HZ4,He likes them!,5
B000M25HZ4,Excelente calidad,5
B000M25HZ4,The socks are well made and exact match to the photo. Please be advised that these are the thinner type socks. There is a difference between the cushion and these socks,4
B000M25HZ4,These socks were very thin and unfortunately got holes within a few wears and stretched out within a few years. Not sure what made them different from all the other Adidas socks we have purchased in the past but they were definitely not the same quality.,3
B000M25HZ4,"I'd go one size higher just to be on the safe side, these run a little small",4
B000M25HZ4,"ADIDAS LOW-CUT SOCKS, (SZ 12-15) REVIEWI'm a guy who has size 14 feet.  I like wearing the low-cut style of sock in spring and summer.  The big box stores often don't seem to carry them for larger feet.  Sometimes I'll luck out and find some at Marshall's or TJ Maxx, but it's hit or miss (mostly miss).  I have turned to Amazon and found there are quite a few brands to try.These ADIDAS low-cut socks for bigger feet are great.  They slip on nicely and are soft, contouring to your foot without being too snug feeling-- they are just right!  I like the way the back is low-cut but not so much that you would get a blister while running-- you've got enough coverage for over the heel there for an extended jog/run.  The low profile looks great with workout wear or a pair of khaki shorts while out on the town.The only thing I'd give them a less than perfect score on is their ability to wick moisture.  When I come back from a 2-miler out in the hot sun and have worked up a sweat, I'll come back home to take a shower and notice they are lightly damp.  They're not soaking or going to cause me a moisture-related blister or anything like that,  it's just there might exist a better pair to wick away moisture if that's your primary reason for seeking out a pair of socks.  To be fair, I've often worn a pair in less intense daily situations and they've very much remained dry to the touch after a full day of walking around (at work,  for instance).  I'd give them a 3.75 out of 5 in their wicking ability.Overall,  these ADIDAS socks are light-weight,  comfortable and will contour to men whose feet happen to be larger than average quite nicely.",4
B000M25HZ4,All good here,4
B000M25HZ4,they slay,5
B000M25HZ4,"Very good socks, and comfortable!!!!!!!!",5
B000M25HZ4,These socks will be a re-order (when needed)Definitely agree with advertisers claim: About this itemFEEL COOL AND DRY WITH ADIDAS CLIMACOOL Supporting your body's cooling system through the power of advanced materials. Your sweat is wicked away to keep you comfortableCushioned foot for comfort and durabilityArch compression secures foot and offers extra support,5
B000M25HZ4,Se las compre a mi hijo y le encantaron,5
B000M25HZ4,Great price. Size. And fits great,5
B000M25HZ4,"I wear a size 12 shoe and I bought the XL (12-15). I am very happy with the fit. The thickness and stretch of the fabric make them fit well. They do not ever feel too tight or restricting, nor too lose and oversized. I wear them with both high-tops  (they barely show with my Adidas Hoops) and low tops (they are about 1"" above the back of my Brooks Ghost).One very slight drawback: If I walk around the house in them they attract a little bit more cat hair than some other socks. This is not a big enough issue to stop me from wearing them, even if I am just planning to walk around the house in them.",5
B000M25HZ4,My 15 year old son size 91/2-10 shoe . Wears large . He lives in these socks. They are comfortable and curable.,5
B000M25HZ4,really good fit. they do not roll down the back of the heel like other ankle brands.,5
B000M25HZ4,Liked the fit.,5
B000M25HZ4,"If you have arch issues or bunions these are the bomb, just enough support",5
B000M25HZ4,"I bought these socks for my husband as replacements for socks that naturally wear out.  This is the first time I purchased this brand and will be the only brand I purchase in the future.  He has peripheral neuropathy in his feet and anything that can give him a bit of comfort is a plus.  These socks have a nice cushion that he loves.  He says they feel good on his feet and fit better than any of the socks I've previously purchased for him.  He wears a size 14 shoe and loves the fit and feel.  Highly recommend these socks even though he has to wear steel toe tennis shoes, these are a success.",5
B000M25HZ4,Been wearing these several years. Feel good & last me a long while. Seems to be of good quality.,5
B000M25HZ4,Good quality and colors. Might be a bit heavy for summer wear but only time will tell.,5
B000M25HZ4,Good brand and reasonably priced.,5
B000M25HZ4,No complaints. Solid socks.,4
B000M25HZ4,Just what I needed,5
B000M25HZ4,These work well and he fit is very good. They are not no show socks but I was not expecting them to be.,4
B000M25HZ4,"Comfortable socks.. Need to get the larger size than what you would normally wear. The size I have had to stretch them, then they were moving cause not the right size.. it was just a good price for sock brand",4
B000M25HZ4,You really never know what you are going to get when you order socks.  The material is good and works well for keeping moisture under control.  They are comfortable and fit well.,5
B000M25HZ4,"Heels blow open during first use. Not Quality, Adidas.",3
B000M25HZ4,"Right size for my feet, maybe a little (xL)",5
B000M25HZ4,It has more stretch (elastic properties) to stay up making it a great fitting sock that doesn't slide.  The toe seam is more noticeable than most possibly due to the thin socks.  Then again they don 't slide and are thin which are 2 big pluses in my book.  A tiny takeaway on my 11w feet is that they are actually tight enough to take away a degree of comfort.  Nonetheless it's a great fitting sock.,4
B000M25HZ4,I love it,5
B000M25HZ4,"They are soft, even after so many wears and washes between me and my husband. But not too soft like they get too warm. I love the material, and the quickly turned into my favorite socks. Color is perfect, fit is perfect. Good durability, no shrinkage. You won't regret",5
B000M25HZ4,Good,5
B000M25HZ4,"These are quality socks. I purchased them while on vacation because the AirBnB was very cold. They are not very thick but they are very warm. I washed them a couple times and they are still in tact, none of them have stretched out or lost elasticity. I would definitely buy more of these",5
B000M25HZ4,They work,5
B000M25HZ4,Fit comfortably,5
B000M25HZ4,2nd time ordering these. I'm more than happy,5
B000M25HZ4,Got thse as a gift for my grandson.  He loved them.  They fit great. Good price & saved me from hoing to store. Grat price.,5
B000M25HZ4,Ok,5
B000M25HZ4,The quality and fit was perfect.,5
B000M25HZ4,Great socks but I like the thicker cushion that Costco stocks of these,4
B000M25HZ4,Comfy and fits well.,5
B000M25HZ4,"I have two 19 year old sons and they won't wear anything else for socks. The best comfort & fit. They wear size 12 /13 shoes so the XL socks are perfect! Try them, you will be pleased!",5
B000M25HZ4,Nicer than most of my other ankle socks. And really comfortable. I'll probably make these my default sock purchase from now on.,5
B000M25HZ4,Socks are fine. Open package and inside package was open. One pair of socks missing.,3
B000M25HZ4,I wore a pair once and got a hole in one sock the same day the material seem rotten,3
B000M25HZ4,"These are nice socks, much better than cotton. However, they are thicker than I like, as I prefer thinner socks. These are about the same thickness as standard cotton socks",4
B000M25HZ4,There are way too many plastic fasteners that cause snags when removing them on top of stupid plastic hanger! Not environmentally friendly and has no thoughtful packaging process.,3
B000M25HZ4,Good comfortable fit,4
B000M25HZ4,"Great light breathable ankle socks.  The elastic holds it in place without slipping like the Asics they sell at Costco.  The low-key logo also looks nice.  Initial observation looks very short but upon stretching it over my feet, it fit nicely and I am a size 8.  Not too sure if it will fit size 12 as advertised though.",5
B000M25HZ4,Decent socks good prices,4
B000M25HZ4,"These socks are really comfortable and sold at a great price, 100% satisfied.",5
B000M25HZ4,"These are my favorite socks. Adidas did right by making these moisture wicking and adding some compression to the arch area. These socks are light, thin (but not too thin,) cozy to wear and sit right above the ankle. This makes them perfect for wearing NMDs so that my heels don't rub against the back of the shoe. After a day of hard work or a long workout, they continue to stay comfortable and cool. I will note that a couple of socks have started to fuzz up on the outside of the sock a little, but I have come to find this is pretty standard for socks of this material. If I run into issues with this later on I will update my review to reflect that.",5
B000M25HZ4,These socks are good and it was surprising the Adidas brand was same or cheaper than no name brands.,5
B000M25HZ4,Its good,5
B000M25HZ4,Like the over the ankle socks. They are soft and comfortable plus I don't slide around in my shoe. I really liked the color selection and  it fits my wardrobe colors. I bought two sets of socks so I'm set for a while.Great buy.,5
B000M25HZ4,My husband totally loved these. They fit comfortably and are so soft.,4
B0874V8THD,I'm 6' 190. Fits perfect. I also have long arms and the sleeves are plenty long. Feels like a great added layer for warmth and very comfortable to wear under work shirt. Worth it for sure. Will buy more.,5
B0874V8THD,Very good for working out in the gym and fits true to size !!!,5
B0874V8THD,It fits like a second skin very warm and wicks sweat,5
B0874V8THD,"This really does the job and keeps you warm.  My son runs fall track which is outside most of the time and this is his go to to keep warm.  We have tried other brands, but a lot of them are tight- not snug like this.  If he loses this one I will definitely buy another for next season.",4
B0874V8THD,"Definitely has a good look and feel to the touch! This product has a specific dimensional fit from shoulders to waist. There is very little stretch in the stomach and waist. This makes it hard to get in and out!  You can consider this a body shaper waist trainer garment.The first wear was a little itchy, pay close attention to the wash and dry instructions.Overall, I will be satisfied if I can make it more comfortable.",4
B0874V8THD,Keeps me warm on my long motorcycle rides.,5
B0874V8THD,Nice shirt pretty tight,4
B0874V8THD,I like it,5
B0874V8THD,Got this for my son and he wears under his clothes when he has to work outdoors. He loves it that he ordered them in different colors,4
B0874V8THD,"I use this under a Alpinestars air bag and the jacket over that. Does the job, I got the large going by the size chart I would go up one size.",4
B0874V8THD,Son just loves this shirt.  Size fits perfectly.  Im sure he will get another if this one wears out since he wears it all the time.,5
B0874V8THD,Excelente producto,5
B0874V8THD,Great for under scrubs. Stays in place with compression. No sticking to scrub tops during busy shifts. Very comfortable. Moisture wicking.,5
B0874V8THD,Buenos materiales y duradero,4
B0874V8THD,Really great quality slimming tops!!,5
B0874V8THD,"El material es agradable y transpirable, perfecto para usarlo con actividades fisicas",5
B0874V8THD,My son wears these under his soccer jersey for playing on cold nights and they work great.,5
B0874V8THD,He's warn for work and play. Works outside and snowmobiling. Comfortable.,5
B0874V8THD,"It stretches very well. Nice produce , love it",5
B0874V8THD,"Nice color, good fit. I have several in different colors.",5
B0874V8THD,Great shirt. But confused why it costs $45 when it even came with a tag saying $35.Almost noticed the shirt had at least 10 small holes. Husband still wants to wear to work but I think should be returned for the price,4
B0874V8THD,Package was set nicely on myPorch . My merchandise was is great condition,5
B0874V8THD,"I suggest ordering a size higher or maybe 2 sizes. A medium will fit very tight, like a small. When it does fit well, its very nice and breathable. Will update after 1st use.",4
B0874V8THD,"Been a huge Under Armour fan for a while. These shirts are amazing, I love how they feel against the skin and it doesn't stifle me. Super breathable, lightweight, and keeps me cool/warm depending on the weather. I wish they would make a ColdGear equivalent but they only make a ""fitted"" version of this shirt in ColdGear. This shirt can be worn in warm and cold weather and it will work to keep you both cool and warm.",5
B0874V8THD,great fit,4
B0874V8THD,Decent price and in stock unlike most stores around right now,5
B0874V8THD,Under armor is by far my favorite brand! Great quality always and is amazing for athletes like me!,5
B0874V8THD,I am 5'1 & 197 pounds the large is a great fit! I really like how stretchy it is and comfortable it is to wear. I am buying another one! The thickness of the material is great,5
B0874V8THD,Great product,5
B0874V8THD,Always a good fit and high quality. Thank you.,5
B0874V8THD,Just what I wanted,5
B0874V8THD,Under Amour nunca defrauda.  Lamentablemente tuve que devolverlo por talla,5
B0874V8THD,I love this. After I received it I immediately orders the other colors.,5
B0874V8THD,"This compression shirt is fantastic! It provides excellent support and fits snugly without restricting movement. The material is breathable and moisture-wicking, keeping me cool and comfortable during workouts. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a high-quality compression shirt!",4
B0874V8THD,"I actually got this as a bad layer for a cruise to Alaska and absolutely love it. It's thin so you can easily layer it without bulk and it provides a tremendous amount of restatined body heat. Never felt too warm, but it keeps your radiant heat close to the body so you aren't losing it. Probably great for workouts too, but for travel and every day use as a warning base layer, I can't recommend enough. I actually ended up getting another one after the trip because I love these so much.",5
B0874V8THD,I've bought many of these through the years for my son that plays soccer. Quality is great and fit is perfect. They are easily washed and dried without damage. They are lightweight and help in the cold weather. Material is stretchy and doesn't shrink. I will purchase again when he goes up in size.,4
B0874V8THD,"I was a little skeptical at first, but it did help with muscle soreness. I tried going one size up and one size down, from my normal/regular street clothes. At the end of the day if you are a XL in regular shirts, then you should get XL with these.",5
B0874V8THD,Talla perfecta,4
B0874V8THD,They are awesome and true size,5
B0874V8THD,"Bought a whole set (upper, bottom and shorts) of the same color for working out @ the gym and it works great. I can feel it absorbing and evaporating all the sweat off my body, especially my back. Good quality and it all sits very tight.",5
B0874V8THD,Ordered mens large.  It fit like a small.,3
B0874V8THD,Warm and flexible,5
B0874V8THD,The pink is very bright I love it!,5
B0874V8THD,My son got this and wears it under his football uniform,5
B0874V8THD,We tried the large and it fit like a small.  Maybe for a 16 year old boy large.,3
B0874V8THD,Satisfecho,5
B0874V8THD,Honestly i bought this because i saw many others wearing this on tiktok and it looked good and if your just trying to show off your muscles its cool however looking good and feeling good are not the same and personally feeling good when im in the gym training at my hardest is important. The Shirt is constantly pulling up on its own making you have to constantly re-adjust the shirt anytime you engage in just about any physical activity. If it wasent for that tugging of the shirt it would have been perfect unfortunately that was not the case. The overall quality and of the shirt was good and it kept me warm enough in colder environments. Overall i would give this shirt 5/10 its pretty good but if your actually trying to workout its not the way to go,3
B0874V8THD,"I ware this under my Aerostitch Roadcrafter R3 & Compcooler water-cooled vest.  It is absolutely the most comprehensive protection without impeding the ability of my water-cooled vest.  If there is an emergency, and I have to remove my Roadcrafter, I am easy to see and still comfortable in the heat.",5
B0874V8THD,"The material is wonderful, very soft over your skin, and have a perfect fit.",5
B0874V8THD,Bought this for my teenage son for outdoor sports and it has been a lifesaver this spring with the up and down temps. It fits well and helps keep him warm while still being breathable. The quality seems good and should last us awhile. He is 6'1 225# and wears a large for reference.,4
B0874V8THD,Fit great,5
B0874V8THD,Great price,5
B0874V8THD,Excellent fit. True to size,5
B0874V8THD,I'm a huge Underarmor fan and these heat gear items are the best.I live where it gets very hot and I ride handcycles exposing me to more heat and sun than most. The heat gear items actually do help you cool off. As they get wet either from sweat or water they help to dissipate the heat to cool you off.I highly recommend these.,5
B0874V8THD,My son plays football and his school colors are burgundy. He absolutely loves the way it feels under his uniform.,5
B0874V8THD,The color is the best part . Comfortable and a nice looking shirt . Good to wear on my morning walk .,5
B0874V8THD,"they are one size smaller than the regular shirts on the market. Large is medium, medium is small and small won't fit you. So, buyer beware.",4
B0874V8THD,Very snug!,4
B0874V8THD,Fits perfectly and keeps warm!,5
B0874V8THD,Thanks.,5
B0874V8THD,"Purchased as an under shirt for ball. He likes it. Bought a medium  . He is 5'6"" 150 and fits right.",5
B0874V8THD,"I bought this to use as a base layer for keeping me warm in a half-marathon during winter time. It was great, kept moisture out and keeping me warm at the same time so I wasn't freezing my butt off during my half marathon. One thing to note though is that I'm usually a small for athletic wear and garments, and the base layer came in very tight. Good thing it's stretchy!",4
B0874V8THD,He said it is comfortable,5
B0874V8THD,I have had one for 5 years and looks new.  It's fits so well to your body you only notice it because you're warm.  Great for sports.,5
B0874V8THD,Great product. Fast delivery,5
B0874V8THD,Really comfortable and have held up well after numerous uses. Happy with my purchase,5
B0874V8THD,My husband got these to wear under his workout shirt at the gym. He loves them. Very comfortable and true to fit.,5
B0874V8THD,Bought for my wife who is tall and thin.  The shirt fits perfectly.  Sizing chart was very accurate.,5
B0874V8THD,My son has really likes it. The only thing I would say is they are hard to clean other than that it's good for sports on a cool day.,4
B0874V8THD,"I bought this shirt for under my basketball jersey. Our color is cardinal red, and although this color says cardinal, it is more red than cardinal. Just a warning. It is very comfy and lightweight, just a different color than advertised.",4
B0874V8THD,It fits great keeps me warm,5
B0874V8THD,Worked well for me golfing in Ireland & Scotland. Wore these under a short sleeve polo and as long as it wasn't too windy I really didn't need a jacket much.,5
B0874V8THD,"I used this for under my basketball jersey and is was very comfortable. i never got to hot in it and help a lot with some of the colder gyms, its very true to size but its all tight fitted.",5
B0874V8THD,"This pressure shirt will keep me warm as an underlayer while hiking in Norway, Scotland and Iceland in the coming weeks.",5
B0874V8THD,Get well,5
B0874V8THD,Great fit not to thin not thick!,4
B0874V8THD,Great fit a little overpriced,4
B0874V8THD,Great item but compression is made so small and tight I would suggest going up a size if not 2 if you want a comfy fit. But still amazing quality from Under Armour,4
B0874V8THD,"It fits tightly and nice! I would reccomend staying true to size. I usually wear a tee or a tank top under, and it makes the fit look a lot nicer while keeping me a little bit warmer in the gym.",4
B0874V8THD,If you want them skin tight order your regular size.,3
B01D2GRTIE,"The socks are heavy-duty, designed to withstand vigorous workouts. They hold up exceptionally well, even after intense physical activity, making them ideal for sports like pickleball.These socks are incredibly comfortable. The no-slip design ensures they stay in place, providing a snug fit without any discomfort. The cushioning offers extra support, enhancing overall comfort during extended wear.The socks come out of the washer looking and feeling great. They retain their shape and quality even after multiple washes, demonstrating their durability and high-quality material.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"High quality, well fitting, and stylish. If you like socks, you'll love these. I run a significant amount. Good moisture control, no rubbing or chafing, and no slipping.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"Extremely comfortable, well fitting athletic socks, durable, easy to wash, economical. Thank you.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"These have been nice socks. I use them primarily for running and walking. They are the right thickness and cushion for my use. The colors are fun and they seem like they will last for a while. They did have some fraying after the first couple washes, but, after cutting off the loose strands, they have not continued to fray. They are a good size for me as compared to other brands. They hug well around my foot without feeling too tight. Some socks compress my feet too much and feel uncomfortable. These are definitely high end socks that might have more targeted cushion and support, but over all they do all I need them to do. I would definitely buy another pack.",4
B01D2GRTIE,If you want the most comfortable and dry socks look no further. This is the best sock for the money hands down.,5

B01D2GRTIE,"Soft with a goof fit. Thick enough to give a little extra padding, but not too thick.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"I don't usually wear ankle-high socks but I was having back surgery and was told that for many weeks after, I was not to ""BLT""  (bend, lift or twist).  That meant that over the calf socks like I usually wear were out of the question and my Wife (brilliant woman that she is) said that since she'd be the one helping me put on my socks and shoes for a while, ankle-high socks might be a good choice.  She was right.  I did a little research on Amazon and found these Saucony socks.  They're great and they don't require any wrestling to get them on or off.  I'm still wearing the Saucony socks, even though I'm well on the road to recovery from back surgery.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"I normally wear a men's size 9.5 shoe, but Amazon's sizing recommendation suggested a medium (fits up to size 8 on the packaging). While I can stretch these socks to fit, anyone with a shoe size above 8.5 may find them too tight. If you prefer your socks to stay above the shoe line, I recommend opting for the large size instead.",4
B01D2GRTIE,My husband wears these ALL THE TIME now.  Extra points for them coming in various sizes!  It's so hard to find socks that don't have the heel all the way to the ankle for us smaller folks.  It really makes a huge difference to be able to wear a sock that FITS!,5
B01D2GRTIE,"Good quality, fair price, but unlike previous socks from them these were slightly long. I wear a size 10 shoe.",4
B01D2GRTIE,I had my grandson has a size 14 ft he said the socks are very comfortable and he loved them!,5
B01D2GRTIE,Great item! As described,5
B01D2GRTIE,They hold up great for the price! Have only had to throw out one pair for holes a year in.,5
B01D2GRTIE,These are the only socks my son will wear. We buy a package several times a year for him.,4
B01D2GRTIE,Super soft and good quality for the money. Very durable and not too thick.,5
B01D2GRTIE,"Soft,",5
B01D2GRTIE,My son runs 20-40 miles/week depending on time of the year and his training regime. These socks keep moisture off his feet and help with blisters. We have purchased two sets of these and will continue to buy them.,5
B01D2GRTIE,Great quality,5
B01D2GRTIE,Fit great,5
B01D2GRTIE,"looks good, feels good, love it, it would be better to have 7 in a pack, so that it's for every day",5
B01D2GRTIE,"I love these socks. I purchased a pack of them about 6 months ago. They are comfortable, cool in the heat and warm in the cold. I will continue to purchase Saucony socks as long as the quality stays the same. I highly recommend them!",5
B01D2GRTIE,"These socks are great for any athletic activity, particularly walking. They provide a great cushion and are comfortable as well as affordable. I highly recommend them if you're considering new socks for your everyday activities as well.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Fit my size 14 feet well. Lotsa synthetic in the construction though. Not as absorbent or warm as higher cotton content socks.,4
B01D2GRTIE,Perfect sock for the average runner. Provides cushion and a slight support in the sock prevents sore feet and calluses always keep a fresh supply.,5
B01D2GRTIE,Look good.  Wash well.  Fit well. Comfortable.,4
B01D2GRTIE,Very comfy and thank goodness sold in large quantities when you have a teenage daughter that steals your socks all the time.,5
B01D2GRTIE,I was pleased they were somewhat thick.,5
B01D2GRTIE,"Having tried them all, Darn Tough is the best, 'buy it for life' sock. Smartwool is the second best, softer but not as durible and they don't have a hassle free lifetime replacement no questions asked. I'll always use Darn Tough, but it's nice to have a cheap sock for yard work, around the house, etc.These are good for the price. This will be my third order, but not due to the socks wearing out. One 6pk in 2021, and another in 2022, now a third in 2024. Who knows how socks magically disappear. They don't fall down below the back of the shoe very often, are thick enough for cushioning while being ventilated, so cool. They reduce friction for high movement activities. They wash well and aren't finicky like wool is, I always wash on cold though. They have held up well for three years of intermittent use (not daily in these socks).",5
B01D2GRTIE,"The Saucony Men's Multi-Pack Mesh Ventilating Performance No-Show Socks have become an indispensable part of my daily wardrobe, offering unparalleled comfort, durability, and performance that exceed expectations.One of the most notable features of these socks is their exceptional breathability. Constructed with high-quality mesh panels, these socks allow for optimal airflow, keeping my feet cool and dry even during the most intense workouts or long days on my feet.

B01D2GRTIE,Excelente material,5
B01D2GRTIE,These socks are excellent quality.,5
B01D2GRTIE,Good for big feet. Shink  a little,4
B01D2GRTIE,"Love the socks and love that they are black but easy to pair up. (I'm very picky about having my socks match). The only complaint is, if you are like me and border on the large/x-large size get the bigger size. I thought the smaller would be ok, but my shoe tends to eat the sock some and can make it uncomfortable at times. I really do like the thickness of them. They aren't super thin like some socks I've gotten, but yet aren't so thick my shoe doesn't feel right. I will buy them again but go to the bigger size.",4
B01D2GRTIE,"I buy these everytime I run out of socks, they are very comfortable and support my feet and never cause any problems.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"Fit perfectly. Do not shrink or get baggy.Thick enought to feel the quality, but not so thick that they feel hot or too tight.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Was not sure about buying and trying these socks especially when they are so inexpensive. I was pleasantly surprised that they are of good quality and quite comfortable. Will buy again for other styles.,5
B01D2GRTIE,"So I normally wear size 14 men's shoes, but for whatever reason every other running/athletic sock I've tried that says ""XL size 13-15"" always feels painfully tight & restrictive, & most don't seem to make a size any larger than XL/13-15. However, even though they say 15-17, the XXL version of these socks feel like a dream, and I feel like my feet are comfortable in socks for the first time in years haha. So if you're a person like me who has large & slightly wide-ish feet in the size 13-15 range I highly recommend sizing up & trying the XXL size of these socks.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Works well,5
B01D2GRTIE,"These socks fit well, are comfortable, cross between no-show and ankle socks.Problem is they grab all the loose fibers and pet hair in the house. That doesn't come loose in the wash.",4
B01D2GRTIE,"Second time around buying these socks for my husband, and we'll continue to do so. They're comfortable, don't cut off circulation, and last a pretty decent amount of time. If you wear dark socks for work they might not last quite as long from such consistent use, but they're still a fantastic option. Especially for those who have large feet as the case with my husband who wears a size 16W.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Comfortable I love em,5
B01D2GRTIE,"I would describe these socks as just ""okay"". They are on the thin side, and the fit is a little bigger than I would have expected (mens size 12). These are good for casual around the house wear, but I would not wear them to the gym or any physical activity. Overall, just meh.",3
B01D2GRTIE,A good value.,4
B01D2GRTIE,"The socks are comfortable; however, if your shoe size is on the tail end of a size, consider going to the next size. I wear a size 12 and purchased large (size 8 - 12). They fit well for walking, but on runs, they will start to slip off from time to time.",4
B01D2GRTIE,"Hold your socks for my review- kidding. These bad boys are so comfortable, they make my feet feel like they're lounging on a fluffy cloud. Seriously, I've worn these socks every day, and I swear my toes are singing a happy tune.Let's talk about the material for a second. These socks are thicker than a stack of pancakes at a Sunday brunch, but in the best way possible. They provide just the right amount of cushioning, making every step a cozy adventure. And guess what? They're tough cookies too! I've put them through some serious sock battles, and not a single tear in sight. It's like they have superhero powers or something.Now, here's the real magic trick: these socks don't fade in the wash. I've seen socks vanish into thin air after just one laundry session, but not these guys. They're like the wizards of the sock world, maintaining their vibrant colors no matter how many times they take the spin cycle plunge. It's like having a fashion show on my feet every day.Speaking of feet, I've got size 10 clompers, and these socks hit the sweet spot right below my ankles. They're the perfect length for showing off my cool kicks while keeping a low profile. But you know what's not low profile? My wife sneaking off with these socks all the time. She's got size 8 feet, and she's always ""borrowing"" them. I think she loves them just as much as I do.So, to sum it all up, these Saucony Men's Multi-Pack Mesh Ventilating Comfort Fit Performance No-Show socks are the MVPs of foot fashion. They're comfortable, durable, and they even have the power to make your significant other go all sock bandit on you. Trust me, you won't regret slipping your feet into these delightful foot cocoons. Just make sure to keep an eye on your sock stash or you might find yourself doing the sockless shuffle.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Solid athletic socks at a good price.,5
B01D2GRTIE,A little thicker than I wanted but good quality,4
B01D2GRTIE,"I purchased these for myself, but my 16 year old decided that he needed them more so.  Quality is great, color and thickness are wonderful too.  Great fit while not overly compressive.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Works. Not too thick and long enough.,5
B01D2GRTIE,Very comfortable,4
B01D2GRTIE,"These socks fit very well, except for one pair. The one pair, the orange accented ones, do not stay up on the heel and slip down into the shoe. The other 5 pairs are great.",4
B01D2GRTIE,"Comodas, agradables al tacto y protegen el pie adecuadamente",5
B01D2GRTIE,"Nice socks, but not no show.",4
B01D2GRTIE,"Good quality and is generally good pairs of socks...I knocked one start because I think the description left me to think that there's cushion and arch support...in reality, there really is no significant cushion or arch support.",4
B01D2GRTIE,"I ordered 12 pair of these socks and I'm happy at this price.  They are polyester and have two mesh panels in the top so they breathe well and don't hold a lot of moisture.  That makes them comfortable for running.  I did an 11 mile run in a pair today when the socks arrived and I had no blisters or hot spots and the socks stayed in place, no slipping.  The polyester also means they won't pick up odors as bad as cotton socks.As for fit, I wear a size 10.5 US in a dress shoe and a 11 US in a running shoe.  The fit is fine for me, not loose, not tight, comfortable.I like the fact that you get 6 pair all the same color.  I hate trying to match up socks coming out of the dryer.  I tossed all my assorted other running socks in the trash.  Now, I've got 12 pairs of running socks and any two make a pair.  If I'm fishing through a drawer at 6AM in the dark for black socks, any two will make a pair.You can't beat the value.  6 pair for $14 is great.  I've had good wear from polyester running socks before so I expect these to hold up well.  If I get 6-12 months out of a dozen pair  for $28 bucks, I'm not gonna complain.EDIT 12/19/2019: I just trashed the first 12 pair and bought another 12.  I can't believe I got 3 years out of the first dozen.  They held up well running 2 days a week, gym workouts twice a week, and general summer wear.  At the end a few still looked pretty good.  But for this price I figure if I get a year, I'm happy.  Three years is amazing.Edit 3/7/2022:  I just bought another 12 pack of these socks.  The previous bunch lasted me about 16 months before the elastic gave out.  I can't remember any of them wearing through, no holes.  They just won't stay in place any more.  So 16 months X 30 days = 480 days.  Divide 480 / 12 pairs and I've gotten about 40 wearings from a pair of $2 socks.  No complaints here.  I wear them pretty much every day for the gym, mountain bike rides, road runs, trail runs, hikes, mowing the lawn, or just kicking around the house in shorts.  I'll sometimes go through 2 pair a day, run + lounging, or lawn + lounging.",5
B01D2GRTIE,The comfort is nice. We got the larger foot size. So far they haven't stretched out and it's been several months of use. They have not worn out yet either. They seem to be holding up well.,5
B01D2GRTIE,"I run like 50 miles a week. And these hold up good, especially for how inexpensive they are. Rarely ever get blisters.  I live in Georgia, US of A , so it's stupid hott summers and you sweat a ton with 90% humidity. Sure they do get soaked. But still no blisters. Never worn a hole through them really either. Highly reccomend.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"I wear a US size 14 shoe and these socks are the best find yet. They fit! They are not too thick or too thin. Perfect for people who have ""hot"" feet!",5
B01D2GRTIE,Fit well and feel great  no issues .,4
B01D2GRTIE,"Very shocked at the quality. The felt solid at first but after a few washes, it seems the material is cheaper and weaker. There is a whole in the bottom of several socks? And I haven't worn them that much.I'm sorry I bought a second pack so prematurely. Overall the socks look good but feel cheap.",5
B01D2GRTIE,"Like the overall fit and cushion of the socks, but they do get really warm on my feet if it's a warm day. They're ok, but not my summer go-to since they make my (always cold) feet quite hot.",4
B01D2GRTIE,De excelente calidad y comodidad para el uso diario,5
B01D2GRTIE,Good,5
B01D2GRTIE,Surprisingly decent socks,5
B01D2GRTIE,My husband's feet sweat so much and his other socks would smell so bad after just a few hours. These don't make his feet smell at all for the entire day! I'll definitely be buying more in the future! They also look great and feel great. They're soft and a good quality,5
B01D2GRTIE,"Love these socks. Had some addidas that wore out so quickly in the heal and ball of the foot. I love these for daily wear, for lifting in the gym, and for runs. Great sock, you won't be disappointed!",5
B01D2GRTIE,"Comfortable. The right size. Wick moisture away. Durable. Look great. White. Stand up to chlorine bleach, not that they need it often. So happy I bought them.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Nice socks that don't move around too much and don't make my feet sweat.,4
B01D2GRTIE,"I wanted some no-show socks and this was a brand name at an affordable price so I ordered them. I was very surprised how comfortable they are. I mostly use them for long distance bike riding, but they are thick enough with enough cushion that they work for use as regular socks as well. Very happy with the fit and cushion. After several months of about 10 uses and 10 washes each they are holding up just like brand new.",5
B01D2GRTIE,Very good comfy .,5
B01D2GRTIE,Good purchase,4
B01D2GRTIE,"Thin, breathable, and comfy",5
B01D2GRTIE,Look good but they don't stay on my foot and slide down. I'll give them a few months before throwing them out.,3
B01D2GRTIE,Absolutely love these socks. Perfect ankle high. They can get stretched out after prolong use and leave a bulge around heel/achilles. Enjoy the color options available and the pa k sizes to go with the quality,5
B01D2GRTIE,Very comfortable. Glad they come in larger size to fit my size 13 feet. Would buy again.,5
B01D2GRTIE,"So, title, yes I am a repeat buyer. I bought a pack 2 years ago and almost all of them are still good. I bought this second pair because a few have the heels wore out. For context I'm on my feet in my sketchers airsoles (I think that is their name, if not close enough. Honestly they are like air to me. Best pair of work shoes I've owned.) at least 10 hours a day, logging many steps so these socks still holding up after two years for the price is a fantastic bargin!I may potentially be back for more socks in two years but I am realizing now between two packs that I have a abundance of socks which is fantastic.P.S. These are cat approved. My kitty Richard Nixon, she likes these socks more then others for some reason. She always headbutts me and rubs up against me but she really tries to bury her head in my foot when I wear these lol. She rubs her face on my feet like a scratching post but the socks are definitely not scratchy.",5
B09NM221JM,"I recently purchased the COOVAN 10 Pairs Men's Ankle Socks, and I must say, I'm quite impressed. These socks offer comfort, quality, and affordability in one package.First and foremost, the comfort level of these socks is outstanding. The cushioning provides a soft and cozy feel, making them perfect for everyday wear. Whether I'm walking, running errands, or just lounging around the house, my feet remain comfortable throughout the day. The low cut design is also a plus, as it gives a clean and casual look while still offering ample coverage and support.One thing to note is that they are slightly larger than I expected, but this wasn't a significant issue for me. In fact, it's only noticeable if you prefer a more snug fit. If you're like me and don't mind a little extra room, these socks are a great fit. They stay in place and don't bunch up inside your shoes, which is a big win for comfort.The quality of these socks is impressive, especially considering the price. They hold up well to regular wear and washing, showing minimal signs of wear and tear. The durability ensures that this 10-pack will last me a long time, making them a fantastic value for the cost.In conclusion, the COOVAN 10 Pairs Men's Ankle Socks are a comfortable, slightly larger than expected, and excellent quality option for anyone in need of everyday socks.

B09NM221JM,Too long,4
B09NM221JM,perfect simple sock. white is gross.,4
B09NM221JM,These are on the synthetic side so they don't absorb sweat as well as cotton. They are on the thinner side. Will be replacing with ones offering more cushion.,5

B09NM221JM,"First box of socks had six pairs vs ten, second set had ten. Socks are nice and hopefully they wear ok",4
B09NM221JM,"The quality seems good on these socks, and they have a good fit. They seem to pass through the wash just fine and they don't feel heavy or constricting. They do not breath very well. They are polyester and not cotton so that's something to consider. I tried a pair without washing them and another pair after being washed once and one that got washed twice and you absolutely need to wash them before they will breath at all. They don't change much from 1 to two+ washes as far as breathability, but from 0 to 1 makes a huge difference. I normally wear running shoes that have mesh tops and sides so they breath just fine. I don't have any issue with my cotton socks. I'll try to update my review after the years end once I know for sure how they handle.",3
B09NM221JM,These stay put on my floor and the doggie bowl stays put.,5
B09NM221JM,I like the quality of this product.,5
B09NM221JM,"I wear these when wearing shorts. Like the black color, do not show dirt as easy. A summertime must.",5
B09NM221JM,I have always like using ankle socks in the spring and summer but have always had issues where they would roll down while walking. Turns out I didn't have the right size socks. These come in XL and fit perfectly. I no longer have issues where my socks roll down and these feel great.,5
B09NM221JM,Very comfortable and breathable good fit also,5
B09NM221JM,I wear a 15 in most brands but this is too small for me.,3
B09NM221JM,I like the thickness and the arch support. I haven't managed to wear a hole in the heel or toes so that's nice,5
B09NM221JM,"The material feels like a quality product and retains it shape and feel after a few washes. The sizing was advertised as Large/XLarge but product is clearly labeled as XL, so a bit sloppy if you only need a large.",4
B09NM221JM,The socks are so comfortable,5
B09NM221JM,After two or three washes the tread begins to frat in the toe and heal area,4
B09NM221JM,Socks are the right size and comfortable,5
B09NM221JM,"The COOVAN black ankle socks are incredibly comfortable, fit snug without being too tight or too loose, and are well cushioned but not bulky. They are low cut ankle length socks that cover right above your typical running shoe, so they are just the right length. I am a size 11 foot and Large-X-Large fit me perfect so sizing checks out.These have been my go to socks for the past few years and I'm always happy to get a fresh new pack when my old ones inevitably wear out.",5
B09NM221JM,Good products,5
B09NM221JM,Seems to be well built. Should last a while.,5
B09NM221JM,I got these for my wife because she loves the comfort and cushion they provide plus they keep her from using mine,5
B09NM221JM,Snug fit.,4
B09NM221JM,"Nearly 1/2 of these socks have ripped in the same spot over the course of under a year. The ripping started on about the third day. Even pulling them on very carefully, they rip near the ankle bone.",3
B09NM221JM,"Good design and looks good. But thin material, don't think this will last long.",3
B09NM221JM,The comfort is good but the size is too big!,3
B09NM221JM,I like them.  The size is good. I don't really like the color on the bottom because I can't make them as snug as I like but They serve their purpose.,4
B09NM221JM,"Socks seem durable, (only time will tell), but they do supply good support. Sizing for me anyway seems to run a little small.",4
B09NM221JM,Love the fit they are awesome!,5
B09NM221JM,Order a size smaller good quality,3
B09NM221JM,"I own both the new style (these) and the older style of the same Coovan comfort cushion socks so these are the difference's that I've noticed between them.To start they are a lower cut than the previous style. In my second picture I have the new style sock on my left foot and the old style on my right. The new sock sits comfortably below the tongue of the show and well below the ankle. The old style sock sits almost flush with the tongue of the show and right to the bottom of the ankle. If you're looking for a low cut sock, these are the ones.They are of a lighter material while still having just as much cushion (if not more) than the previous style. They are much better for exercising and running in as the material is much more breathable and assists in wicking away the moisture much more effectively and quickly leaving a cooler and dryer foot.The support that they offer is amazing as well. They have 5 bands across the arch of your foot, the fabric in the bands seems to be thicker or possibly more elastic was used in this area. You can't feel the difference on your foot but feeling the material in your hand you can tell there is something different in this area.Fit is spot on as well, I typically wear a 12 shoe and have a narrower foot. I'm always a bit weary because my typical sock size is a 8-12 M and these are listed as a 10-13 which I thought could be a bit too bit. I was pleasantly wrong, these fit snug without being overwhelmingly tight and I've had no issues with them slipping down into my shoe on longer runs.Overall these are a great sock for sport or casual use, I've worn them a few days now and have absolutely no complaints. As I said earlier I do have the older style as well which I have had for a few months now and worn everyday since. I've had no issues with those matting up, producing holes, stretching, or loose threads. I expect the same quality out of these.",5
B09NM221JM,I'm going to go back to the expensives ones. These do the job tho. Probably last a little while,3
B09NM221JM,I love these socks so much. I'm down to wearing my last pair and plan to buy another box just bec,5
B09NM221JM,They are a little small for a size 15 foot. They do feel good.,4
B09NM221JM,Fits and feel good,5
B09NM221JM,Put a couple pairs on and tore holes in them while putting them on. Comfortable when wearing is the only reason I gave them 3 stars,3
B09NM221JM,These are really great socks. I'm a big guy and I have problems finding good socks to wear. And I must say these are really soft. And I have big feet size 14 shoes and these socks fit comfortably on my feet. And they aren't tight ether.  They do go about the ankle.  And the gray goes good with about anything. I bought 20 pairs and got them within 4 days. And I was so impressed with them I bought another 20 pairs again which will make me 40 total. Yeah some people might say that's over kill. But I do have problems finding great fitting socks so I stock up. Less headaches on finding some later in the future.  Must buy products 100% 5 star rating,5
B09NM221JM,Socks are very comfortable. My foot size is a 11 3E and the 9-12 size fits great.,5
B09NM221JM,Have always had issues with cotton socks as the lint balls they produce are very annoying and get everywhere.  I'm happy to announce that these socks so not produce lint balls!  They are also lightweight and help reduce moisture.The one disappointment seems to be in regards into how durable they are.  I've had a couple socks thus far that have produced holes in the bottom.  However at this low of price I kind of expected that.  Would still get them again when I wear out this order.,4
B09NM221JM,"Over 2 years ago I was searching for sox to replace my Adidas socks that I was so fond of, and I found these. They were the right amount of Spandex and polyester, so I decided to give them a try. Normally when I order from a brand I am not familiar with they are gone in 6 months. But I saw these pop up in my previous orders and I checked, and they are still selling these socks. These are now my favorite brand for socks. I ordered 2 packages and liked them so much that I ordered 2 more packages for my son. My only regret was that ankle socks will freeze your ankles in the winter. Next time I will get a little more coverage on the ankles. One of the socks had a defect when I got them and their customer service quickly remedied the problem. I wear them in the winter like house shoes so I have snagged a few of them but I bought so many that I don't miss them. Most socks won't last 2 years, but I still don't need to buy socks. I hope these guys are still here when I need socks again.",5
B09NM221JM,"I purchased this pack to replace another that was not ""one size fits all"" and had to be trashed.  Happy to find these at a reasonable price and hope they'll last me at least the summer.",4
B09NM221JM,My husband loved these socks.Comfy and supportive. Highly recommend them.,4
B09NM221JM,Confortable. Great fit. Good quality.,5
B09NM221JM,"I received these today, so they haven't even been worn.  What I ordered and what I received seem very different.  I ordered the GREY socks, which appeared to be a medium to lighter grey.  But what I received were very dark grey socks, almost charcoal in color.  I plan on keeping them, but if you're looking for that exact color you see on the screen you may be disappointed.",4
B09NM221JM,Nice Comfortable,4
B09NM221JM,Just what I needed in a ankle sock. A little cushy and goes with mostly everything,4
B09NM221JM,Great socks for a great price!,5
B09NM221JM,"Comfortable, perfect fit, and look great!",5
B09NM221JM,"I wear size 14 shoe and had an issue with this type of sock. They would be light weight and kind of tight. This product feels great and fits my size 14 with room to spare. The socks also has a nice weight to them. Not too light, and not too heavy.I would buy them again!",5
B09NM221JM,"The socks themselves are very comfortable, but after a year, many of them have holes on the bottom",3
B09NM221JM,I love them because they fit my son and he is a size 15 shoe,5
B09NM221JM,Very comfortable on your feet and fit my 13 EEEE with room to spare.,5
B09NM221JM,"I highly recommend these socks to anyone with a larger shoe size (12 - 14). As a size 13, most socks barely cover the back of my heel and then shrink even further after a first wash/dry. These fit perfectly, are comfortable, and maintain their form.",5
B09NM221JM,"These socks last way longer than I expected them to. I used to only buy darn tough socks, but decided on a whim to try out these 10x pairs as the DT's were just not lasting for me longer than a year and they cost a lot. After 18 months of owning ten pairs each of the grey and black socks, I have five pairs left in each. I wore holes in the soles of each of the socks after pretty heavy use (summer hiking, long walks, sliding on floors, sometimes walking on pavement just in socks because my deliveries were dropped off too far from the door..) I'd say I'm pretty pleased with the socks thus far, and am actually leaning towards ordering another set for the next year as well.",4
B09NM221JM,Several socks I have ordered have deteriorated after several months. After two years these have still maintained there quality.,5
B09NM221JM,"Man, I love these socks. They are the perfect thickness and very warm. And at a great price!",5
B09NM221JM,"The socks fit well, snugged a bit your foot and feels good, however the material is from is not great because they feel very slippery - cheap polyester; even on your shoes you feel like they foot sliding inside a bit more then it should. So if your looking a day to day sock, yeah they work; but if your looking a sock for sports.... yeah spend a few extra dollars, your ankles will thank you.",3
B09NM221JM,Fit great and just the length and size I was looking for,5
B09NM221JM,Exactly what I expected... Fit is perfect... Very soft... Was up nice... Good quality,5
B09NM221JM,"Comfortable, soft, correct to size, only issue the material rips easily",5
B09NM221JM,"Comfortable, perfect fit and exactly what I needed!!",5
B09NM221JM,Good quality.  Gray color just right (sometimes gray is hard to find).,5
B09NM221JM,I was trying to get more bang for my buck rather than throwing money at Under Armour socks.  These are just as good for a fraction of the price.The other day I pulled one of these out and one UA sock by accident and couldn't tell until I looked down and noticed the UA logo.,5
B09NM221JM,"Received on time, as described. No problems.",5
B09NM221JM,Wash first,5
B09NM221JM,"A little snug. It stretches but still snug on 10 man size. Thicker than dollar store, but not very thick.",4
B09NM221JM,I love these socks. I had to order more since my family keeps taking a pair or two.,5
B09NM221JM,Use the sizing chart to determine the sock size .  The Fit was PERFECT !,5
B09NM221JM,"They seem good. Mine ran a bit larger. Ordered XL, large would have worked. Still good!",4
B09NM221JM,"Oh man I love new socks and especially these bad boys, they are comfortable and made well they last me a while and that says something.",5
B09NM221JM,These are good socks but they are a little small for my size 11 feet. Ultimately I gave them to my wife.,4
B09NM221JM,For guys with big feet. Almost feels like your walking on clouds,5
B09NM221JM,"I ordered these for my son he works in a kitchen he loves them super comfortable , light breathable!",4
B09NM221JM,Seem to be decent socks. Not to thick not to thin and time will tell on durability,4
B09NM221JM,"Mostly for work or behind the drums , either way they are light and not hot at all. Definitely a great deal. Btw , I couldn't find anything of this quality in any department store especially in my size and price.",5

B01ABVLOHA,"These Nike socks are a go to in our household of 4 boys/men.  We order them frequently because they are tried and true for quality, fit, durable for everyday and for sports!  Love them.",5
B01ABVLOHA,Fair price,5
B01ABVLOHA,They were very good quality but in the photo the socks are short but when they came they were very tall.,2
B01ABVLOHA,"My preteen daughter recently started wearing the Performance Lightweight Crew Training Socks (3 Pair) in medium size and White/Black, and she absolutely loves them! These socks have met her needs for style, comfort, and functionality. They provide excellent support and cushioning during her various activities, from sports to casual outings. The lightweight material ensures that her feet stay cool and dry throughout the day.She also appreciates the fashionable design and the versatile white and black color combination, which easily matches her outfits. The durability of these socks has been impressive as well, withstanding her active lifestyle. It's great to find a product that meets the needs of a growing preteen. Highly recommended for anyone seeking comfortable and stylish socks for their young ones!",5
B01ABVLOHA,Fit great and are comfortable,5
B01ABVLOHA,I recommend getting the dry fit because these rip on the bottom easily,4
B01ABVLOHA,Good quality,5
B01ABVLOHA,"Great price, very well-made, and used on a daily basis by my kids. I was so happy to see the price on this product being so low!",5
B01ABVLOHA,They are a little pricey for athletic socks.,4
B01ABVLOHA,Only 3 pair,3
B01ABVLOHA,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I JUST FEEL THEY WERE A LITTLE SNUG ON MY FEET AND I WENT UP A SIZE, OTHER THEN THAT I WOULD suggest GOING UP 2 SIZES IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER FOOT. 10/10",4
B01ABVLOHA,I use for everyday wear and for soccer,5
B01ABVLOHA,Their really comfortable and a lot of people fold them they are a little thin on some parts but their overall,5
B01ABVLOHA,These will shrink when you put them in the dryer. Other than that great pair of socks!,4
B01ABVLOHA,Nike brand socks that are thick and comfortable. A Crew style that goes up to shins with a classic nike style.,4
B01ABVLOHA,Should be 6 pairs not 3 for that price. Sporting good stores and Nike sell same socks for same price but you get 6 pairs instead of 3. I bought these socks thinking they were different then regular Nike socks but there the same,4
B01ABVLOHA,Have ordered three packages of these socks. All have been identical quality and have held up through high intensity workouts and wash / dry with no issues (some reviews mentioned the fabric had holes worn through after one use; I did not have this experience).,5
B01ABVLOHA,Highly recommend  Great quality. Great product.,5
B01ABVLOHA,Girls likes fit ok,4
B01ABVLOHA,These socks are thick and are soft. I love them!!,5
B01ABVLOHA,Great quality.  They stay white and never get those little stupid balls the way socks do.  They look new forever.,5
B01ABVLOHA,My granddaughter loves anything Nike!  These socks were so much cheaper than buying them at Dicks!,5
B01ABVLOHA,These socks are made really well and the price was right.  They were too big for my 7 year old grandson but they will fit my 9 year old grandson.,5
B01ABVLOHA,"My grandkids wear there socks with no shoes everywhere.  It's so frustrating,  but these socks take a brutal beating and still hold up.  Best quality socks I've found.",5
B01ABVLOHA,Disliked!  The price??,3
B01ABVLOHA,"Horrible, areas of the sock that were under pressure points on my feet were threadbare after the first use! Not durable!",1
B01ABVLOHA,"They fit her real good, and they look good, and she likes to wear them",5
B01ABVLOHA,seem to be good quality and my grand-daughter loves them,5
B01ABVLOHA,I bought these for cheer and I wear them all the time I love them,5
B01ABVLOHA,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The quality of these socks are far less than I expected. However I knew with the price being so low there was a chance these would be fake. I'm 98% sure they are not authentic Nike socks. So just know that when you purchase. These are not thick and they are not the same density or stretch as my other socks like them. The swish is not clear on them and half janky.,3
B01ABVLOHA,"Medium size just fit my granddaughter who wears size 7 shoe and when I washed them, they shrank and were snug.",3
B01ABVLOHA,Me encantaron son muy calentitas y quedan muy bien!,5
B01ABVLOHA,These are my favorite socks right now.Everything listed is accurate. Would buy again.,5
B01ABVLOHA,Horrible deal,3
B01ABVLOHA,I got them for my boyfriend and he loves them so much he needed new ones and he was so excited,5

B01ABVLOHA,"These are perfect to wear with sneakers. They fit nicely, are comfortable, and wash well.",5
B01ABVLOHA,"love these! cute, comfy, perfect for working out",5
B01ABVLOHA,,5
B01ABVLOHA,Authentic Nike and a good fit.,5
B01ABVLOHA,I thought it was six pairs and it was three for $30!!! Now I have to pay to return it. Do not buy from this seller,1
B01ABVLOHA,"These are legit Nike socks, they arrived on time, and they're SO comfortable. What more could you want.",5
B01ABVLOHA,"Ok, gets holes easy and lasts about 5 wears",3
B01ABVLOHA,These are great. So soft and comfy. Will buy more!,5
B01ABVLOHA,Works great for baseball,5
B01ABVLOHA,Love they way these feel but after putting on my first pair I noticed a hole by the toes already,3

B01ABVLOHA,ery comfy not to thick,5
B01ABVLOHA,Best socks ! So comfy and stylish.,5
B01ABVLOHA,They are very comfortable and perfect for everyday not just workouts,5
B01ABVLOHA,"I purchased these socks previously & had no complaints. However this second purchase was not what I received priorThese socks are much longer in length, made of very thin material (like dress socks). Not sure what happened to my order however they do not feel, perform or resemble authentic Nike socksI have attached a picture, you can clearly see the differenceThe left is my second purchase. The right is my first purchase !",1
B01ABVLOHA,Comfotable,5
B01ABVLOHA,Nothing amazing nothing bad,5
B01ABVLOHA,Great socks!,5
B01ABVLOHA,"Definitely fake, the swoosh is backwards on the socks lol",2
B01ABVLOHA,Great,5
B01ABVLOHA,The quality to price ratio is off on this. It says light weight so I did picture them different but I have skinny legs and they were tight on me in an uncomfortable way. They are also see through,2
B01ABVLOHA,Nice comfy,5
B01ABVLOHA,This was a gift. Was just what I ordered,4
B01ABVLOHA,These are not actual Nike brand socks as portrayed. They are poorly made and thin material. Delivery took over 3 weeks. Terrible quality and service.,1
B01ABVLOHA,"Comparing these to ""real"" Nike socks, you can easily feel and see the difference. There was no packaging (Rolled up loose in a poly mailer), there were no tags, pulled threads and they look fake.",1
B01ABVLOHA,Seller listed socks as a 100% cotton. The label says 67% cotton. I can't return because they were already worn by my child before I checked the label.,1
B008YA0ZN0,"Classic no show style with minimal logo...just a small adidas logo on the front. These socks are soft, comfortable, and fit my size 13 feet perfectly. Have worn them many times now with repeated washings and they seem to be holding up very well. Perfect height for no shows...they look great with shoes but can also just be worn around the house. Will be ordering more in the future when these finally do wear out.",5
B008YA0ZN0,"If you have big feet and need quality socks give these a try. My husband is a big guy at 6 foot 7 and wears a size 14 these are his favorite socks. They are quality and last a while, look good and feel good. They also actually fit his foot size comfortably",5
B008YA0ZN0,"Cost is as expected, quality materials, breathable materials. No holes yet, style is comfortable.",4
B008YA0ZN0,Comfortable and affordable.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"These socks are comfortable. They are perfect under hiking sandals, where I need some extra cushion but don't want to be the guy obviously wearing socks with sandals. They dry quickly, and they have held up well.",5
B008YA0ZN0,These socks are not too thin and not too thick. Very good quality and fit.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"Finally, a pair of socks that stay ""up"" and fit large feet correctly! Don't forget to check out and buy the other colors that are available too! I have the black and also grey pairs of these.",5
B008YA0ZN0,"Comfortable to wear, easy to wash",4
B008YA0ZN0,So nice bought more even though old ones still have life,5
B008YA0ZN0,As described.,5
B008YA0ZN0,simple black socks for my husband,5
B008YA0ZN0,"These socks are just a little bit longer than a lot of the ""no-show"" brands of socks. They provide a comfortable fit and leave exactly the amount of room in the toes to be a great sock.",4
B008YA0ZN0,Comfortable,5
B008YA0ZN0,My husband needed new no show socks.  I got him these and he loves them.  They don't slid down and fit just right.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"Outstanding, I definitely recommend!",5
B008YA0ZN0,It's comfortable if you need a thick sock but using these socks when working out isn't comfortable for me because it's thick all around not just on the bottom,4
B008YA0ZN0,really comfortable and practical,5
B008YA0ZN0,They fit extremely well very tight and soft. My feet are very breathable when the socks are on and they slide into my shoes very easily.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"I've bought many different no-show socks over the years, and most tend to slip off my foot while walking. Plus, many I've bought are extremely thin and will fall apart faster than most other socks. This sock is significantly thick (without being too thick), and USUALLY does not fall off my foot while walking, running, or working out. In some shoes it may rarely slide a bit, but this is nothing in comparison to other no-show socks I've bought.I first bought these socks in white, and had to come back for grey, and I haven't been let down so far.",5
B008YA0ZN0,"I ordered XL over a year ago. LOVED THEM!!! So clicking on the exact same order in my history to make sure everything was the same, I ordered another pair. The XL were MASSIVE only Shaq could fit in them...So I ordered the L and they're pretty tight. Not sure what happened to the XL, but now I don't know what to order. Maybe it was a XXL in an XL bag or something, but they were extremely different sizes, replacing the same order twice.",3
B008YA0ZN0,Decent fit for a men's size 12. Will need to see how they hold up as they're thinner than expected.,4
B008YA0ZN0,I ordered these socks as my preferred socks were out of stock.Pro: Comfortable. Fit a size 14 foot.Potential Con: Significantly thinner than my preferred sock. Question how long the socks will last.,4
B008YA0ZN0,"Nice socks, but too thick for my liking. Prefer the lightweight version of these socks.",4
B008YA0ZN0,He said they are very comfortable and cozy. I will be buying him more.,5
B008YA0ZN0,Was thinking they would be more sport like. They just regular socks.,3
B008YA0ZN0,"I recently purchased the Adidas Men's Athletic Cushioned No Show Socks with hopes of finding comfortable and supportive socks for my athletic activities, but unfortunately, my experience with them has been far from satisfactory.Firstly, despite the promise of arch compression for a secure fit, I found that these socks offered little to no support. The arch compression was minimal, and the socks tended to slide down and bunch up around my ankles during physical activity, which was both uncomfortable and distracting.Additionally, while the socks are advertised as ""cushioned,"" I did not find them to provide adequate cushioning or impact absorption. After just a short period of wear, I noticed discomfort and soreness in my feet, particularly in high-impact areas like the heel and ball of the foot.Furthermore, the durability of these socks left much to be desired. After only a few washes, I noticed signs of wear and tear, including fraying around the edges and thinning of the fabric. This was disappointing considering the reputation of the Adidas brand for quality athletic wear.Overall, I cannot recommend the Adidas Men's Athletic Cushioned No-Show Socks based on my experience. The lack of support, insufficient cushioning, and poor durability make them an unsuitable choice for anyone in need of reliable athletic socks. I would advise potential buyers to explore other options that may offer better comfort, support, and longevity.",3
B008YA0ZN0,Great socks that are low cut and barely above the ankle of the item is exactly how it was advertised great quality and quick shipping,5
B008YA0ZN0,Great Fit. Very Comfortable. Washes Well. Great Colors.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"These socks feel amazing!  Like all new clothing, I put them in a bucket to pre-soak any color run off but the water remained clear!  You don't have to worry about color run-off.  I haven't had these for more than a week so hopefully they hold up over time.",5
B008YA0ZN0,These are my husbands favorite socks!,5
B008YA0ZN0,"These socks are reasonably comfortable and well-fitting, but not very plush. I was hoping to use them as athletic socks but they lack substantial cushioning especially in the soles. These would be more suitable for non-athletic activities.",3
B008YA0ZN0,"I literally love these no-show socks. They're great, comfortable, made of good quality materials and aren't too thick for normal everyday shoes. 5/5 would recommend.",5
B008YA0ZN0,Not as cushioned as advertised,3
B008YA0ZN0,"I bought the socks for my husband who plays golf. He has been wearing the socks 1 a week. He walks the 18 holes so probably gives them more work than riding a golf cart.  It has been over months since the socks were purchased and I am starting to see the thinning of the heel and big toe areas.  The price seems right, but I think next time I might buy socks with a little more thread.",3
B008YA0ZN0,"I have been buying these socks for the last several years.  I really like the no-show socks, because I don't like socks irritating my ankles.  These are great, for the most part, and they are comfortable.  My only complaint is that I wish they lasted longer.  They start out nice and thick, but they wear down relatively quickly, and the elastic around the ankle stretches out.  I find myself throwing them away far sooner than I think I should.  Over all, I think they're decent, but just wish they were more durable.  It's a good price, so I don't complain too much about it.",4
B008YA0ZN0,Nice fit - tight without being difficult to get on. The cut is exactly what I want - below the ankle! Love them!,5
B008YA0ZN0,"I gifted this to my husband and he loves how comfortable this socks are, are washable, durable, they are elastic and have good quality.",5
B008YA0ZN0,Recomendables. Algo abrigadas pero ideales para ejercicio,5
B008YA0ZN0,"Really liked the fitting and quality of the product. However after the first wash, it started slouching",4
B008YA0ZN0,"These socks feel a cut above. They are comfortable and lightweight. They do a great job at keeping feet dry. The quality and durability is impressive. They are a little slick if you're wearing them on something like wood floors. I would recommend them as an everyday sock or for use in sports. They are not the most thick or warm, but that isn't their design. Mine came packaged on a hanging rack; a bag would've been more convenient.",5
B008YA0ZN0,"The socks are comfortable but they just wont seem to stay up on my foot. They are constantly falling down and end up under my heel. Very, Very anoying!",3
B008YA0ZN0,"I ordered these Adidas no-show socks, mainly on the name. Within 30 minutes of trying them on they were sliding off my heels, they were also thin material. I guess the old Verbiage of you get what you pay for it true in this case.",3
B008YA0ZN0,Honey needed new socks so I got him some. He is really picky with socks but he loves these,5
B008YA0ZN0,"Excellent socks, just the right thickness and support. Great price and very comfortable!I highly recommend!",5
B008YA0ZN0,Fits good exactly like my other low socks.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"They are comfortable socks for sure, but they aren't exactly no-show socks. When wearing sneakers you can still see them clearly. I've purchased other Adidas no-show socks at other retailers and they were fine, but these are not. They are comfortable, but the ""no show"" is misleading",3
B008YA0ZN0,Im a Mens Size 13 ordered XL and they fit Great!,5
B008YA0ZN0,"I got these to replace my reebok cause they don't sell all black pairs for easy matching jn the laundry. Got these so comfortable but no more than 2 mo in and pairs are getting hole after hole in the front portion for the foot. Never had holes developed like this in my reebok till like years in. So going back to reebok, oh well maybe all black available now.",2
B008YA0ZN0,Comfortable and fits wide feet well. Stylish and great no show socks,4
B008YA0ZN0,"Comfortable, I like the compression part too.",5
B008YA0ZN0,"I wear a size 9.5, 9 in converse and they cover up to my ankle. No ankle or back of the foot rub when wearing low cut sneakers. Not the warmest but I am weird and have cold toes. They do what socks should do, sock. Not gonna leave them to your kids but they will get you through the season.",4
B008YA0ZN0,Slip off.,3
B008YA0ZN0,"I bought these specifically to run in. You know, to reduce weight and drag and to keep legs cool in the heat. The weight and drag thing is probably more of a dumbo feather but I for sure prefer running in heat with these socks. The fit well and they don't slide off and are thin. I can't speak to durability as I've only had them for a couple of weeks. Overall they get a thumbs up and the seal of approval of someone who is a very slow runner.",4
B008YA0ZN0,Will buy again!,5
B008YA0ZN0,Just a good sock.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"Awesome socks. Best I have owned in a long time.They changed the listing from ""Men's"" to ""Women's shortly after I bought mine. Mine came in packaging labeled ""Men's"", so just be aware when ordering!",5
B008YA0ZN0,Great no show sock that stays put on foot and feels comfortable. High quality material.,5
B008YA0ZN0,Bueno,5
B008YA0ZN0,Good quality. Had the same type of socks for many years and they last.,5
B008YA0ZN0,Socks wear well and were a good value.,4
B008YA0ZN0,Says size 6-12 but I'm a size 10 and they are too big. I end up having to constantly tuck them back in the shoe.,4
B008YA0ZN0,Comfortable good value,5
B008YA0ZN0,Boyfriend likes them.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"I started riding my bike to work (where I'm also on my feet all day) so when it was time to replace lost/holey pairs I wanted a good value on pairs that were going to be comfortable but with a breathable material.I was pleasantly surprised these are thicker than I expected. They are not only VERY soft and comfortable, but also breathable for active feet. Sizing was also as expected - they are sufficiently elastic and high quality.",5
B008YA0ZN0,I wear a 11-12 sock and had to send the first order of large back and get XL's.  I bought these when they were $10 and would never pay any more for these socks.  *Walmart has very similar socks like these for $10,4
B008YA0ZN0,Good quality and last. Great price,5
B008YA0ZN0,I love how soft these socks are and the fact that they don't slip down!,5
B008YA0ZN0,Too short. Keep falling off when wearing on walks.,3
B008YA0ZN0,"Great feeling cotton, hide socks. Perfect for golf and running.",5
B008YA0ZN0,Socks are advertised as no show but these are Low Ankle cut.,2
B008YA0ZN0,This sock pack is great. The quality of these socks are really nice and soft but sturdy.,5
B008YA0ZN0,Great fit. Color and quality is excellent works well for size 13 feet,5
B008YA0ZN0,My teenage son had the grey version of these socks for a yr and asked for them in black. They are good quality.,5
B008YA0ZN0,"I purchased these for the no-show that they say they are.  These socks definitely show, i am a men's size 11, and they show, albeit its not much.  I though about returning them, however i changed my mind.  The fabric is nice and soft, and even with the little show, i replace all my white ankle socks with these.  I will look for another no-show sock.",2
B008YA0ZN0,Extremely comfortable and the price is right,5
B008YA0ZN0,Ankle elastic stretches out to quickly,3
B008YA0ZN0,"The socks are very thin. Minimal padding and comfort. Worn once and washed, came out of the dryer looking very worn and frayed. I would have been better off buying the same brand of much higher quality and wearability at COSTCO for about the same price.",2
B00VTVBHQK,My son was very happy. Good fit and nice and soft. Seems to retain shape  Seems to be great quality and great value.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Long enough to tuck in, even after wash & drying. Soft and decent quality. I would purchase again.",5
B00VTVBHQK,Comfortable and breathable fits nicely but it does shrink in the dryer and changes the fit.,4
B00VTVBHQK,Wash and wear well for young men who are always on the move. Value for money is good.,5
B00VTVBHQK,Nice and soft and the long length is perfect for my tall toso!,5
B00VTVBHQK,"I have been buying these for over 15 years. If you're anything like me, you know that the quality has changed, and it's really a 'hit or miss' when trying to buy them online. Sometimes they are incredibly thinI used to go to that big box store (that starts with a W) and buy them for $3-$5.00 each during the season. I only bought the 'single' shirts that were folded on the shelves, but they became harder and harder to find, sometimes requiring visiting multiple 'W' stores (and I despise shopping there). Then they sort of disappeared, or at least in a size that I would wear... a 2x/3x/4x is out of the question. Even the xl is too big, but they're comfortable. The 'single' shirts were always thicker, and the multi-pak shirts were always thinner, so I'm always hesitant to purchase online, as I've had several 'miss' incidents over the years.I wear these ALL THE TIME; for sleeping, lounging, running to the store to pick something up. I wash them repeatedly, and I use hot water and bleach. I think the 'hit or miss' risk can be mitigated, depending on the seller, and possibly if there aren't too many in the multi-pak. Just a guess. My rating here is specific to what I purchased today: the multi-pak of 6, the seller was Amazon, the style was v-neck.The quality is decent. Not as thick as the OG, but closer than the thin ones. The seams all look great. They are 100% cotton, but I do not see 'eversoft' anywhere on the shirt; only the package. Do they wrinkle? Yes. Do I care? No. I dislike blends, so I prefer occasional wrinkles.Good luck! Hope you get a 'hit' on your next purchase!",5
B00VTVBHQK,"Updating review from a one star to four star: Still disappointed that the packaging nor the t-shirt label indicates ""Eversoft"" as advertised! However, this package of  3xl t-shirts actually fits correctly. I believe the first package of t-shirts was incorrectly labeled at the factory because they fit like a 2xl not 3xl.First posted the following:Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Stay Tucked V-Neck T-Shirt - the T-Shirt shipped does indicate ""Eversoft"". These fit like the Fruit of the Loom regular cotton V-neck shirts. Currently own ""3xl Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Stay Tucked V-Neck T-Shirt"" and they are roomy even baggy, the ""3xl Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Stay Tucked V-Neck T-Shirt shipped does not indicate Eversoft and the fit is extremely snug! The shirt does not show ""Eversoft"" and the package they are in does not show ""Eversoft""",4
B00VTVBHQK,Decent quality but like all things made these days they don't seem as thick as they used to be.,5
B00VTVBHQK,Very well packaged. The t-shirts are well made. I was very happy to see that they are being made in El Salvador now.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Comfortable, fresh and durable! What else can you ask?",5
B00VTVBHQK,"The shirts fit and are comfortable, just what I like with a T-shirt.",5
B00VTVBHQK,Very comfortable. They fit just right.,5
B00VTVBHQK,It fits well and came exactly how it was described. Took off 1 stars because the facric was scratchy and stiff.,4
B00VTVBHQK,I love these,5
B00VTVBHQK,Nice feel and good length,5
B00VTVBHQK,Seller was very fast in changing the size.  Very reliable and good fabric.,5
B00VTVBHQK,I am glad that Amazon still has these white T-shirts.,5
B00VTVBHQK,Ideal item thanks,5
B00VTVBHQK,Great value. My husband has worn this size and brand for many years. They fit comfortably and are priced right.,5
B00VTVBHQK,My friend who is wearing them loves the product!,4
B00VTVBHQK,Easy wash and wear.,5
B00VTVBHQK,Very nice soft T-shirts,5
B00VTVBHQK,Nice white and good quality,5
B00VTVBHQK,The size is accurate and quality very good! .,5
B00VTVBHQK,Nice case. Holster holds the phone/case very snug. Needs to be broken in more for easier insertion and removal from the holster.,4
B00VTVBHQK,"I love these T-shirts. I wear them daily, and have been every since I bought them. They hold up in the wash really good. I bought these in 2021, it is now 2024 and the shirts are a little stretched around the neck but still very wearable and very comfortable. I have been wearing these shirts daily for 3.5 years and a little neck stretch from wash and a few tiny holes is all thats wrong with them. Excellent purchase for a durable T-Shirt that gets washed and worn every week for 3.5 years. I bought 2 packs of these at the time. I will certainly buy these again when the time comes. I have also recommended these shirts to everyone I know",5
B00VTVBHQK,"No, not super fancy, or designer brand, but truly every bit as good. My husband does buy the RL brand, but lately they are getting thin in the quality area. I purchased these for him to mow the grass in summer, and to wash his car and truck. These are very good and thjn for summer.",5
B00VTVBHQK,"Only received 11, ordered 12.",4
B00VTVBHQK,"I am a female and prefer the V-neck style.  Not a deep vee and sleeves are just the right length.  Lightweight cotton feels good in FL heat.  There is a bit of puckering around the v portion of the neckline on a few of the gray t-shirts after the dryer heat, but I just give it a quick tug and it stretches back out to lay flat.  Very satisfied with these shirts for my daily errands and projects.  Recommend.",4
B00VTVBHQK,Easy to order and good price,5
B00VTVBHQK,Perfect!,5
B00VTVBHQK,The texture is so good and cool on the body. It also have a very good fitting with our clothes,5
B00VTVBHQK,Perfect fit and good quality,5
B00VTVBHQK,Fruit of the loom lasts a long time - husband needed whiter ones - hot 2xl because of shrinkage - washed a dried in drier -,4
B00VTVBHQK,Useful.,4
B00VTVBHQK,I'm a bit tall and it's in my trunk.  I need XLT for it to fit correctly.  This does - cheap soft cotton t shirt.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"These have a good feel, fit well and do not come untucked.",5
B00VTVBHQK,"I love V- necks.  It is just the style collar that is most flattering on my face, neck and decolletage.  For the longest time, all I could finds in a V-neck, was sweaters.  I would wear them in the Fall and Winter, and then begrudgingly, give them up come spring.  I am always hot, so sweaters were not a good Spring Summer choice, for me, even if I was to be inside, out of the sum.  These T-shirts were the 1st decent fitting non-sweater V-neck I have found in Years.  They fit very true to size, to shirt size.  If you plan to wear exclusively under another shirt, you may want to size down.  Okay, here's how I would describe the stay tuck, and why it's great for everyone.  It seems like they were machined to not have be pre-stretched out at the bottoms, like most t-shirts are.  It is not shirred.  It just starts out fitting closer to your body than most T hems.  Most T shirts are square on a hanger.  These are slimmer at the waste.  Great if you tuck, but even better if you do not.  If you are going to wear it out, it IS a cotton t- shirt; I just carefully, while wearing it, stretch it to a custom fit for my waste.  Then I do the same to my husband's.  When we discovered these, we were both heavier than usual & not liking any clothing.  XL men's looked like a tent on him, but he was too big for large.  And, the exact same, could be said for me.  These shirts in grey & black were just the ticket.  If you try them, you will not be disappointed.  As a matter of fact, my niece(who also loves them) and I discovered that if we see anyone in a grey or black T, that looks flattering on them, and we pay them that compliment, they tell us they are Fruit of the Loom ""Stay Tucked V's or Tees.  More colors would be great.  But they are sliming, so if I could only pick 2 colors I would want black & grey.  The grey is not heather grey.  It is about the same shade of grey (in the sense of light to dark) as heather, but it is smooth solid color.  Not something you see often.  But again, when you see someone else wearing it, you notice it; not because you recognize it, but because it looks good & then, I usually realize I am complementing my own shirt. Lol.",5
B00VTVBHQK,They are 100% cotton and are so soft. They stay that way wash after wash.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"I am grateful for these tees both the value and and the fit. Wow, more than I thought the are great!",4
B00VTVBHQK,"I like to wear undershirts under my dress shirts for work, and in the winter just to have another layer of clothing.  I always wait a bit long and end up with torn or pretty warn out undershirts, so this will refresh my supply and I'll move the old ones to the rag bin.  7 pack is nice, I like that they didn't use all the tape and cardboard in the packaging.  I will purchase again when I need more.",5
B00VTVBHQK,Like these way more than Hanes as the collars hold up nicer,5
B00VTVBHQK,"The fabric is the perfect thickness , and the colors are vibrant. The cut is very forgiving and flattering to any body type.",5
B00VTVBHQK,I liked the fit and comfort.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Quality, shrinkage, & wearability is holding up well for my BT wearing man",5
B00VTVBHQK,"Length is not mentioned. It is hanging under my jacket!For God's sake use specifics: units of measurements, rather than Large!Now I have to order a smaller version and wasting time and energy. Can you write how long and wide the puppy is?",4
B00VTVBHQK,husband says these work well for his needs,5
B00VTVBHQK,Great product at a great price.,5
B00VTVBHQK,great value,5
B00VTVBHQK,It's a great product. Just have in mind that the. may be a little short if you are very tall. I am personally 59. I would like the length would have been a little longer.,5
B00VTVBHQK,On the shirt were very comfortable and fits great.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Well made, quality consistent with usual Fruit of the Loom standards",4
B00VTVBHQK,You can't go wrong with these affordable undershirts. My husband finds them better than the higher end brands which are often cut too short. You can't go wrong with the quality and the price.,5
B00VTVBHQK,Dad loves it,5
B00VTVBHQK,100% cotton tees.  Exactly what I expected and the price is right.,5
B00VTVBHQK,....and very comfortable!,5
B00VTVBHQK,"The quality of these feels really nice, but they shrank a lot! I bought a men's small, planning to wear them myself with room to spare for bedtime (as a woman who wears a medium usually). Out of pkg they would have fit great. But once washed, they are more like a women's small!",3
B00VTVBHQK,Priced rightFits good,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Large was too large out of the package. After washing on hot the shirt shrunk about 1"" width, into the perfect size.Soft.",5
B00VTVBHQK,Very comfortableQuality is good,5
B00VTVBHQK,Good quality for that price,4
B00VTVBHQK,"The fit is good, but the feel is not soft. Might have to wash it a few times to get a softer feell?",4
B00VTVBHQK,Should have been 3 gray and 3 black t-shirts but received all black. Will have to make do as I need for shoulder surgery recovery but would like to have received the gray.Had previously ordered XL which should have provided the loose fit but were too fitted. These are much larger but will work.,3
B00VTVBHQK,It was true to size.,5
B00VTVBHQK,As advertised.,5
B00VTVBHQK,Just what I ordered,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Good quality, and very long. It feels soft and solid, not too stretchy.",5
B00VTVBHQK,thin and small just so you know,3
B00VTVBHQK,"Well made, true to size, good quality, very comfortable. Highly recommend...Purchased twice.",5
B00VTVBHQK,fits perfectly . nice quality,5
B00VTVBHQK,"We were Fruit of the Loom t-shirt shoppers for years, and then the quality just wasn't there (at any price) so we left this brand for another.  We took a chance, purchased these, and are extremely satisfied and impressed with the quality, fit and finish.  Before writing my review, I gave them all a good washing to see shrinkage (a little, but that's what you expect from cotton, so order a wee larger unless you want them to fit tight), and if they lost their quality new-feeling.  They came out of the washer/dryer in excellent shape.  Could not be happier.  Will order again.",5
B00VTVBHQK,"Wish the material was thicker but other than that a good value and I like the length, as I have a long torso. This tee shirt fits me now that I a 38 inch pant but not so much when I was a 40.",4
B00VTVBHQK,"I liked the color combination and they have a good quality feel.  Unfortunately, after washing once (normal setting, cold water, delicate dryer setting), one of the shirt's stitching started coming apart at the ""v"" front part--I used needle and thread and moved on.  No other problems.",4
B00VTVBHQK,Nice fabric and quality,5
B00VTVBHQK,"Was looking for darker undershirts and found these.  They are great.  Wash well, no fading.  Fit is great.  Would definitely recommend and would definitely buy them again.",5
B00VTVBHQK,"I recently switched from using the same brand for about 30 years since that brand seems to shrink more now and then the V does not seem deep enough, if you know what I mean. Size is good; fit is good; material could be slightly heaver but the shirts are comfortable. I'm interested to see if the neck stays flat over time. But so far so good.",4
B00VTVBHQK,These are very comfortable t shirtsI use these every dayThe one thing I would complain is that they do not last very long the collar seems to come apart at the v of the v neck.  Happens more with the black t shirt.,4
B00VTVBHQK,"These are huge.  Huge!  I expected very big, but these are like a dress.  Anyone super tall would appreciate the length.  They will work for my use, which does not include wearing outside of the house, but holy smokes they are big.  Big.",3
B00VTVBHQK,"I recently purchased this white cotton t-shirt and I'm absolutely delighted with it! The quality is top-notch, the material is soft and breathable, and the fit is perfect.The 100% cotton fabric feels gentle against my skin, making it ideal for everyday wear. The classic design and crisp white color ensure it pairs well with anything from jeans to shorts.",5
B00VTVBHQK,The v-neck white T-shirts or a perfect fit and very comfortable.,5
B00VTVBHQK,"The fabric and construction of these V-neck shirts is just what I was looking for. The fabric seems durable, and after two washings was even more comfortable. The shirts are long enough to tuck in, and also to leave out if I want to. Very nice looking, would buy again.",5
B08YW38K6W,Great. Fit well and the grip is great,5
B08YW38K6W,"These socks are sooo comfortable,soft,and durable!I will definitely buy these again!",5

B08YW38K6W,they have a ton of grip and they are really comfortable. It is a little expensive for socks though.,5
B08YW38K6W,"My son wanted these for when he is playing soccer or has a wrestling match. The grip adds added traction. Fits to his foot, easy to care and wash.",5
B08YW38K6W,I bought these for my 94 year old father who was slipping on the floor in our house.  They are a little hard to put on as they aren't easily stretchable. He wears them everyday and I had to buy another package of them.,5
B08YW38K6W,"I love these grip socks they really are amazing but slight issue with them. the grips on these are, well grippy but sometimes it does pick up fur from carpets. They fit well but it gets a little hard to put cleats on with them since they are a little thick. Overall these are helpful while running and I highly recommend!",4
B08YW38K6W,Recommend 100%It was fast and excellent,5
B08YW38K6W,Great deal,5
B08YW38K6W,I play competitive soccer and have always struggled with my feet sliding around in my cleats but ever since I got these I have not had that problem.  These socks are also not that thick so they don't make my feet super hot or make my cleats to tight! 100% would recommend!,5

B08YW38K6W,My 14 year old loves these,5
B08YW38K6W,I thought I was ordering 4 pairs when the package came to the house. I was wondering why it was so heavy. I actually ordered 16 pairs and both of my boys needed it. It was perfect timing. I was also able to distribute to team.,5
B08YW38K6W,Just as good as the more expensive ones,5

B08YW38K6W,These are the best grip socks in the market. Have tried other versions but none are better.,5
B08YW38K6W,My daughter and I both love these socks for playing soccer in. They are thick so you might have to adjust your boot laces but the grip makes it worth it.,5
B08YW38K6W,Got there for my grandson for soccer. We had bought one pair in a speciality soccer shop that were more than all of these. He kept wearing that same pair over and over because they were so expensive to get a second pair. I ordered these for him and we see NO DIFFERENCE in these and the expensive ones at the soccer store. I ordered black and white ones.,5
B08YW38K6W,"Socks look good, feel great, and the gripper bottom really works. I wear a size 10 shoe and these fit perfectly. This is all I wear now.",5
B08YW38K6W,"These are good materials. They feel cushiony and soft. Only problem my son had was that he hard time putting soccer cleats with these. Once he had the cleats on, he feels like they don't slip inside his shoes so he likes that.",4

B08YW38K6W,"Very grippy grip socks, price per set makes them a great value",4
B08YW38K6W,"My son usually wears a different brand that has grip inside as well, but you can get 4 for the price of one of the other brand. My son has noticed a little slippage of his foot but not the sock in the shoe. Fornearly all athletes these grip socks will do the job.  Only a small amount might notice a difference.",4

B08YW38K6W,Looks exactly like the picture and perfect for soccer!,5
B08YW38K6W,My son really likes these. They fit him well and are nice and warm.,5
B08YW38K6W,"Pro: they are slid proof and work great so your foot is not moving around to much when playing sports.Cons: this is really not a bad thing,just something to think about so you get the most use out of the socks.  Do not dry. Let them air dry. Once dry in dryer they don't grip as well.",5

B08YW38K6W,"This is the only second time I have ordered these socks. My some is an ODP goal keeper and also plays club, and varsity HS soccer.

B08YW38K6W,Muy buenas,5
B08YW38K6W,They are fine and do what they're supposed to do. 15yo uses them for soccer. There are higher quality socks off different sites but the price is almost unbelievable. These tend to tear after several months but looks at his teammates they all use them also,4
B08YW38K6W,I had these grip socks for about 3 months and I found out that the grips are always very grippy and they are some very thick socks but also very comfortable.,5
B08YW38K6W,My son loves these for soccer! They are cheaper than most of the ones I found but very good quality.,5
B08YW38K6W,"These are really worth the value. We used to buy the branded ones and were so expensive, but these ones are equally good. If you have  young athlete these ones are must have.",5
B08YW38K6W,"My husband loves these socks with the grips, he has an artificial leg, so the grip keeps him from slipping on the floor.",5
B08YW38K6W,This sock is well made and we have Lux and this brand. The only difference is the brand tag!,5
B08YW38K6W,"These are the only soccer socks my 17 year old will wear.  They are grippy in his cleats, and then he just cuts his required soccer socks to be more like shin guard sleeves.  HIGHLY recommend.",5
B08YW38K6W,Like,5
B08YW38K6W,I have two teenage girls that play soccer and ordered a set to try out and both girls wore them and loved them. I had to order them each there own set of 4. Great value for around $5 a pair!,5
B08YW38K6W,Both of my girls use these grip socks when they practice and play soccer.  They love them!  We have purchased these several times.,5
B08YW38K6W,My son says they are comfortable. We have washed them a couple times and let them air dry. So far they still look and feel like new.,5
B08YW38K6W,Noticeable difference in how quickly my heels blister when I'm wearing these. Do their job great,5
B08YW38K6W,"Very good materials, very good quality and very easy to wash, the truth is that it is highly recommended.",5

B08YW38K6W,Grip socks are great.,5
B08YW38K6W,My son loves these. He wears them inside his cleats for soccer to help with slipping and blisters.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Wecome to the spa.  Super soft and cozy!!  They come in the cutest cloth travel bag too.  Makes a great gift.  Hold up well after washing.  Thick but not bulky.  Color is soft and pretty.  Great to wear to bed to keep feet warm!!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Very soft warm fits nicely designed well seems delicate would fallow wash instructions to keep the sock soft the best part I got one in blue and pink they do not get tight around the ankle while I'm on my feet but also don't slide down under my heal when I walk.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,These are literally the best things I have ever put on my feet!  So soft and luxurious.  Great gift with the cute bag they come in.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These socks will keep your feet warm on a cold night. I like the soft light brown color and how long they are. Long enough to tuck your jammie bottoms into them. They only thing I don't like about these socks ishow they feel on the soles of my feet on a hard floor. It feels weird, gritty, it's not soft or cozy. But they are great for sleeping in.",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I bought these for my daughters as stocking stuffers. I love the canvas bag they come in. Makes them seem more expensive than they are! They are soft and luxe but budget friendly. Highly recommend as a gift for yourself or someone else. Would be great in a gift basket.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife, she has nothing but great things to say about them. The color is neutral and goes with anything whether wearing them out or around the house on a night in. Perfect amount of stretchiness and the durability is fantastic so far. They wash well and wear even better.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"I purchased these for my mom and she couldn't wait to wear them. The long story short is, my mom has to wear compression socks a majority of the day and has struggled to find something that makes her comfortable when she doesn't have to wear them. I decided on these after hearing multiple people rave about them and they are officially her favorite pair.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Very comfortable.  I have to sleep on my back and for some reason can't stand the weight of a blanket on my feet.  So I can now put on these socks and let my feet stick out.  Unlike other socks I've tried, they are not tight and are warm enough without being to hot.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I recently broke my leg and ankle and this sock has been on my foot since! Taken on and off and washed but it stretches so well to fit and keeps my toes warm with the surgical boot. Very high quality worth buying,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"So soft! I gave these to my friends and family for Christmas and they loved it. They tell me they wear them all the time.I wish I had a pair for myself but I have enough comfy socks.The material is nice and I love the color, the tan is so nice and goes with lots of outfits.",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"I bought a few packages as gifts for the holidays!  From a young niece to an elderly person in my family, it was the perfect choice!  So soft and I love the colors!  Great gift item for anyone!",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Bought these for my nieces for Christmas and had to buy for myself too. Great quality and price!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,My favorite socks! Love this color! Washes well super stretchy! Not quite slip resistant but the texture is perfect for wearing anywhere!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Bought these for a friend, made someone's feet happy! (I have a pair just for bed, and these are very helpful in warming my cold feet)!",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Got these as a gift for a coworker and for myself. They are super soft, stretchy and comfortable. They fit perfectly and are super cute!",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Don't hesitate to buy. My Wife loves them. Will be buying more for gifts.,5

B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Soft, cozy socks. I plan to order more. They have also done well in the washing machine",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Love love love not slippery and not sticky on bottom. Cute cute and warm but not too think to wear with shoes. Gave four stars because need more color choices,4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Like walking on clouds. Soft, warm and super cute. Wash well, purchased another pair.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These socks are so soft! I could not believe it.I purchased them to wear with boots. Short boots do the socks could peak out at the top.I did not expect them to be so soft and luxurious!!They even came in a small satchel. I had to double check the price I paid. They seemed like some expensive brand name socks, but are actually very reasonably priced.Highly recommend!",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Not as thick and cozy as I expected, they are soft though. I did like the elastic at top to keep from slipping down and the higher length is nice.",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"The comfort and warmth from these is amazing, the only small drawback is that after wearing them for a couple house, the fabric does come looser and I catch myself having to pull up the heel area back in place, besides that they are so soft and comfortable",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,These pair look comfortable and cute. The material on the socks are fuzzy. The size of the socks are look like they'd fit well.,4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"got these as a gift for a friend- she loves them says they keep her "" tootsies"" very warm",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Bought a a gift for my daughter in law and she loves them,5

B0CQ4QM7Q2,Super cozy and soft. Great gift or stocking stuffer.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,They are so comfy and cute,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,So soft and so comfy!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Part of a chirstmas gift. Came as described (two very soft socks in an adorable gift bag). I will be buying again for myself. Socks are very soft and the color is as shown in listing.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Super soft and cozy. They stretch out a little after a few wears but overall, love them",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,These are exactly what I wanted for my cold feet in bed. They're squishy and they don't have those non-slip dots. The ankles are not tight. They do have one heck of a hardy seam allowance in that toe! I wore them inside out and they were outstanding. Exactly what I was looking for and I will recommend them and I will probably buy more.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Gave to my lil cousin and she loved it. Thank you.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,so soft and comfortable.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These socks are very soft. They are not thin but not super thick. I bought 2 pairs, one to gift and one for myself. Glad I did!",5

B0CQ4QM7Q2,Super soft!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,easy to put on.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Love these!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These are the best socks ever! They are well made, and very upscale. They are thick, incredibly soft and fluffy! I have never had socks that are as good as these! I will definitely be buying more. They came well packaged and in a cloth pouch. The size and length are perfect. They aren't skimpy in any way.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"they are so soft and cozy, I'm obsessed with them",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These are great for lounging around, but if you do much walking, they feel pretty thin and not padded.",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Very soft and comfortable.  Would buy again.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Very soft socks. Would have been comfortable if not for their size. If you have big feet buy these socks.,4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,not bad,4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,This product meets my every need very warm. They are my go to socks. In fact I need a back up pair.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,These are a great product super soft. I bought these for myself and for a gift. Will buy in other color,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I love this fabric. My husband bought me the much more expensive brand version of these and they have not lasted nearly as long. Buy these and try using a heel stick or lotion before putting them on at bedtime and in a week you'll have the smoothest heals of your life.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,My niece loved these socks.  Really warm and cozy.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Product was as it appeared-soft and comfortable-would purchase again.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These bed socks are very soft, fuzzy and very comfortable.Plus keep your feet very warm on these frigid nights!",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Warm and comfortable,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,This product was so soft and warm.fit looks good,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I bought these for my daughter.  She wears a size 12 shoe.  She says she loves these.  They are warm and comfortable and cozy.  She loves the color and they are so easy to wash and dry.  She wanted 2 more for Christmas.  Done.  LOL.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Serve as intended. Provide comfort keeping feet warm, not restrictions as far as movement.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I gave it for a gift and I ask the person how did hey like it & THE LOVED IT!!!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Very cozy.  Didn't live the seam by the toes but totally worth the money,4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"I love these socks, they are soft and warm.",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Love being cozy at home with warm feet!,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Keeps feet nice and warm, but elastic binding is too tight! There's no need for such tight binding at the top of the socks.",4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Liked soft feeling  of material and warmth the sock provides,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I sleep with them on very comfortable,4
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I love these socks and they keep my temperature regulated throughout the night without waking up and them being thrown on the floor.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,I love these socks. They are so warm.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Cozy warm socks.  Good product, thank you",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,These socks are very comfy and warm.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"Packaged cute and has different colors to choose from when ordering. No holes, warm, easy to wash, super soft, and about as slip resistant as other fuzzy socks. 10/10",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,They were kind of expensive but were a great gift. Super soft and well made. Came in a little drawstring bag,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Very soft and comfortable,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,comes in a little tie bag really keeps my feet warm  comfortable while sleeping,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Soft and White!! Goes well with uggs. Wish there was a cream.,5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"So cute, comfy and soft! Worth the money",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"NO JOKE WHEN THEY SAY ""SUPER SOFT AND LUXURIOUS"".  Initially purchased for myself, but I was so impressed and love these SO much I ordered a few more for holiday gifts!  I like that these do not have the rubber spots on the bottoms.. they can be useful sometimes but now they are all too prevalent and it's nice to find some without that are very luxurious!",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,"These made a nice gift. They feel soft, stretchy, and good quality. Seems like they would be warm. The color was nice too. Good gift item for the price. Not sure if they are slip resistant.",5
B0CQ4QM7Q2,Nice socks that are thick and warm.,5
B07JD592BB,Ordered for my grandson.  He loves them because they are nice & long.Great price!,5
B07JD592BB,"These are good, my husband says. No complaints. They're a little long at first fit but they scrunch up just right to a proper level while wearing and they stay tucked in. They did not shrink! Just while wearing,  they rise up just right is all. Oh,  and they don't leave his pecs playing peek-a-boo all day! Fits perfectly at the top.Even without fabric softener,  the fabric feel is well balanced for the price and feels good on my face when I'm hugging him!",5
B07JD592BB,Good tanks. Long for good tuck. I am picky about fabric. These are relatively soft but NOT super soft. 32 Degrees has much softer t-shirts & tanks.,4
B07JD592BB,Nice fit and material. Good price for what you get.,5
B07JD592BB,Nice shirts a little bit to long.  Very comfortable,5
B07JD592BB,"True to the Gildan name, these fit well, are well made, good heavy weight fabric, and the hem does not come out immediately like some other brands. Also, they wash well without shrinking or fading the color. I like the variety of colors they have to choose from.",5
B07JD592BB,"Overall I am happy with these. They do not shrink, they are super functional and soft. They fit just right. I would rate them higher but one of mine came with the seams apart on the strap so it was unusable. But I am happy with the others!",3
B07JD592BB,Good tanks! Always order these one size bigger.They will shrink down to the perfect size.Very good deal on price but all of these no matter what brand will shrink one size down always order one size bigger than what you need wash them and they will be perfectly fine,5
B07JD592BB,"The only place I can find one color for my husband. Every place I go it's mixed. The product has great quality to it, and true to size.",5
B07JD592BB,"Can't live without my ""Gildan""...A-shirts. Wear them daily all year round -- as is or underneath a top shirt. Generous length allows me to tuck deep inside jeans overlapping outside of briefs & stay there. Minimal shrinkage & hold together well after washings & dryings. Occasionally, I will notice a small tear hole starting in material before wearing. Clothing articles now, sure not what they used to be years ago when growing up thru 70's-80's.. ..quite Better then. I repeatedly purchase these when I find them selling below retail so I always have enough.",5
B07JD592BB,"If they didn't get thicker, I would be disappointed.I don't like paper thin shirts.But these are nice after a couple of washes.",5
B07JD592BB,These are by far my favorite undershirts. I like wearing mediums but they are too short & it forces me to get a Large. These shirts are longer so i can actually fit a medium. Bought them in both colors.,5
B07JD592BB,Color lasts a long time they don't stretch or shrink,4
B07JD592BB,Thank you,5
B07JD592BB,Excellent product.,5
B07JD592BB,"Didnt shrink after a wash, still intact and going strong months later",5
B07JD592BB,Very nice undershirt at a good price. Bought several dozen for myself and grandchildren. Would buy again.,5
B07JD592BB,My son loves these. These are not cheap looking and fabric is very thick and soft.,5
B07JD592BB,great product,5
B07JD592BB,"Awesome set of tanktops, great for the gym",4
B07JD592BB,Nice ! I'm pleased,5
B07JD592BB,Great item!,5
B07JD592BB,"My 16 year old, health conscious / gym-loving son, picked these out & he really likes them. That's no easy feat with a teenager, lol!",4
B07JD592BB,"I have purchased these tank tops a number of time. This last time I ordered in Dec of 2024, They now have side seams. Which is not a huge problem. But I do prefer them with no side seams.However, overall, They are the best tank tops I have purchased. And will continue to do so.",4
B07JD592BB,These tank tops make you feel so confident and filled with pride that I couldn't recommend another type of tank top for these colors. They're tight and compress your stomach.,5
B07JD592BB,I bought this as a present for a guy who broke up with me a few days ago but I kept them and now I use them as nightgowns and they're very long I'm 5'11 they go to the middle of my thigh but they are really good quality. I got the 2x size.,5
B07JD592BB,Gave my dad two.  He has since worn one.  I on the other hand am still wearing my old ones.  It looked great on him though so I can't wait to start wearing mine.,5
B07JD592BB,"These Tanks are great! very light and breathable, and the fact that they don't shrink after washes is even better. I've bought this brand once more in the past and safe to say that I'm addicted",5
B07JD592BB,My husband alway ordered online and good price than store,5
B07JD592BB,Comfy for men,5
B07JD592BB,Shirts appear to be super small but stretch nicely.  The wider shoulder feels more comfortable.  A great replacement to the old ones.,5
B07JD592BB,Very good quality,5
B07JD592BB,Son loved them true fit does not shrink,5
B07JD592BB,Pedir una talla arriba,4
B07JD592BB,"Cotton and extra long, true size and color",4
B07JD592BB,just as described soft color i got black. I got it for gift for my husband good quality thanks.,5
B07JD592BB,"I am supposed to enjoy spaghetti straps or something ever since so many ppl poured out about how great thongs are, to my understanding at least.  I prefer these over Fruit of a Loom and Hanes alike.  Also, when it came to Gap tanks, which I really like, but being too weighty on my budget I got hesitant.  Anyhow, these are the more inexpensive item that has proved more lasting and can withstand many washes and still come out just new like the day I got it.  Love them to the point of buying three packs and maybe this is a surprise to some, but I wore every single one of the tanks.  Also, not only do these look good on men, they also do nicely for the women figure too.",5
B07JD592BB,The quality seems fine. I am worried about the fabric after washing but it seems soft and comfortable.,4
B07JD592BB,"Better stitching than I expected, fit was as expected. Good quality.",5
B07JD592BB,"Very well made, soft and excellent quality.",5
B07JD592BB,Love em wear them everyday,5
B07JD592BB,"I work outside at Burning Man during the summer. Limited laundry options available. I just buy a few packs of these, clean shirt every day. Cheap enough where I don't care if I ruin or lose one, but also very soft and comfortable to work in",5
B07JD592BB,I got these to match and wear with a couple of sweatpants I got at home.,5
B07JD592BB,"They advertise Snug fit, they weren't kidding. I normally wear a large and they fit snugly but these are definitely much more Snug. Will probably relax a little after a few washes. Did not expect them to be so long though.  I'm a tall guy 6'2"" and these go so far to even cover my butt. Still going to keep them for the days I want to tuck them in",4
B07JD592BB,"Soy talla S, lo pedi talla M, me quedaron un poco largasSon largas realmente, de igual manera son bien comodas",4
B07JD592BB,I bought these a whole ago and I'm still using them every day.  I will be ordering more. Very breathable.,5
B07JD592BB,I keep buying them after 4 months they are amazing,5
B07JD592BB,"Been using these a while, I like them but for some reason the darker colors shrink (length wise) more than the other ones.Also, my most recent order now has seams down the whole sides of the shirts, which I've checked specifically against my last order and that's new, and you can definitely feel it.",3
B07JD592BB,Just what hubby needed to wear under his uniform .,4
B07JD592BB,Not really very happy with this purchase. My size has always been XL. Washed them before wearing as usual and they fit very tight. These Gildan shirts also developed a few dark stains after multiple washing. Not sure how this happened because they were washed along with other brands that did not stain.,3
B07JD592BB,"They're nice A shirts and typical of Gildan quality.  I like that they're a little longer the FTL, Hanes, Jockey and the other large brands so they stay tucked in.  Pictures are worth 1000 words.  Shirt on Left was washed and tumble dried with medium heat.  Shirt on Right was washed with the other shirt but tumble dried on air only.  Size is XL as I stand 6' and about 175 lbs. waist at 34 with an inseam of 31.  Just extra information for you to decide.",5
B07JD592BB,Great,5
B07JD592BB,I'm 5'9 150 pounds I bought small & th hey Super comfortable to wear & they hold their tight feel without getting too stretched out like some other brands ... excellent quality !,5
B07JD592BB,Loved the item,5
B07JD592BB,"Size is great, comfortable",5
B07JD592BB,"These are still fine A-Shirts for the price; but if you bought them in the past then you should know that they've made them about 1.5"" to 2"" shorter in length and they are slightly thinner material.",3
B07JD592BB,Im a medium and I bought large in error and they still fit great.,5
B07JD592BB,"They are OK, but be warned - they shrink, even in cold water!",4
B07JD592BB,"Is a medium weight, comfortable stretchy T-shirts, also known as tank topsThe black color is deep and rich, the size is flexible because they are luckyThey are made of tree shrunk cotton, so they do not shrink when washedThe medium quality allows for a decent amount of wear on a daily basis",5
B07JD592BB,Great fit. Like thin material,5
B07JD592BB,"Not a bad deal for 5 tee shirt. Bought them in the past (over 2 years) and they held up very well.  The price at ""W"" cost more.",5
B07JD592BB,"These are the most comfortable tank tops I've ever owned.  There are no flaws in the stitching and they washed very well.  I'm a 42/44, and their size large fit perfectly.",5
B07JD592BB,"The medium fit my son who is 6 foot tall and 160 pounds perfect around the arms and underarms, but it was super long. I'm afraid if we wash and dry them, it will help the length, but pull up shorter around the arms and no longer feel comfortable to him. There was so much length, that it was actually bunched at the bottom under his gym shirt. He didn't act like that bothered him, but clearly there is a sizing issue. The length would be for someone around 6 foot 5 inches most likely. He says they are a nice material, better than what he usually gets though.",4
B07JD592BB,Comfortable and light,5
B07JD592BB,They are very comfortable and soft. They are lightweight and wash well. They shrink barely and keep there color well.,5
B07JD592BB,Buena calidad.,5
B07JD592BB,I was looking for a thicker material with a better cut versus the more lower cut these are. Material feels like it will go through the wash a few times then be stretched out.,3
B07JD592BB,"These are breathable but thick. But, they are also soft. That's a difficult combo to get in an undershirt.",5
B07JD592BB,This product fit my husband perfectly but it was a bit long. These are the best quality that we have found without them being insanely priced.,4
B07JD592BB,"Good quality and all, didnt like the style too much",4
B07JD592BB,Awesome under t shirt. Comfy and strong.,5
B07JD592BB,"I wear these tank top t-shirts daily. What I like about them is the wide shoulder straps and the long length of them, they don't pull up out of your pants and they are very soft on the skin. Been wearing the Gilden brand for years now and I just love them.",5
B07JD592BB,"Fits well, longer length",4
B07JD592BB,Like the way they keep you comfortable.,4
B07JD592BB,Grandson love this light weight and comfortable,5
B07JD592BB,"These shirts were highly rated by Amazon reviews so I guess that helped set my expectations high. They arrived on time, however, they were not packed in a box of any kind, but rather shipped in the thin plastic package that the factory folds and places them in just like socks and underwear at any retail store. The bottom seam of this plastic package was starting to come undone on the bottom. Upon opening and removing them, the first thing I noticed was how thin the material felt. Soft but still thin. The next thing I noticed was a decent size hole at the neckline in the very first shirt I peeled from the rest. This alone is why I am returning them. I was willing to take a risk on them even after reading quite a few other reviews about them shrinking in the wash, but finding a big hole in the very first shirt, then the thinness of the cotton, it makes me question the durability of these shirts. I wanted to like them, but I'm walking away disappointed.",3
B07JD592BB,Great quality i definitely recommend,5
B07JD592BB,Not  very big around,4
B07JD592BB,"These tank tops shrink a little when washed but still fit like a large. I've gotten these in Medium but its more stretched on my dad frame so the large just fits me better. If you see smudges in the photos, it's because somebody probably sneezed on my mirror, the shirts come pristine.There are indeed people that wear these under dark dress shirts. I got them purely for the style and to combine them with open button flannel shirts so I can roll up the sleeves and be an approachable giga-Chad. I'm just missing an interesting silver or gold pendant which will stand out because the shirt is black.I can't really pull off the white tank tops, plus the pit areas of white shirts turn yellow and you can't pop any bacne with white or you'll see red dots.The bigger you get as you hit midlife and experience male pattern baldness, layers of fashion do wonders so adding a thin scarf to this ensemble, wearing a quirky trucker's hat, aviators, and maybe even a piercing or some facial hair will go a long way to complete the ensemble.To the women who buy these to wear as a mini dress, I salute you.",5
B07JD592BB,Good buy,5
B07JD592BB,Hold up well..nice quality,5
B07JD592BB,My new go to for tank tops. Great quality and fit,5
B07JD592BB,"Quality cotton material and fits extremely well. No complaints. Note to customers, hang dry then quick fluff in the dryer for like 10 mins. Perfect fit and feel.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,"These socks are very comfortable, soft and fit my feet perfectly (size 10 foot).  The band around my ankle is not to tight and it stays up.  I will be buying more of these socks in the future.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Good quality. Sizing is accurate. Will buy again.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Comfortable and a good fit,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"These are thinner than most socks I've had, which in the hot Texas summer isn't entirely a bad thing. They are comfortable enough.",4
B00Y0NGC1E,They are thin but good quality.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"What can I say? They are Hanes. Good quality, comfortable.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,These socks are not the quality I was expecting. Their thin and have a course/looser knit. Probably won't last as long as my other Hanes sox but I'll give them a chance.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,"For years I've been left disgusted at the '6-12' BS when it comes to socks. I'm a 12, not a 6. These are perfect socks. For a man and his man size Feet! Comfy too.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,"For some reason I thought it said 6 pairs! But, it had the 12 as listed and they're pretty thick! My boyfriend had worn out his old ones so these were a great buy!",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Probably need to order some more.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Nice brand for the price,5
B00Y0NGC1E,very good,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"This is my every day, every event, every occasion sock. I love them as much as one can love and article of clothing.Live, laugh, Hanes black ankle socks.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,My husband loves that these socks are available in a larger size than what is offered as standard.  The longer length is perfect.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,These are some of the most comfortable socks I have ever bought,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Didn't realize there was a difference between ankle socks and no-show socks.  Too late to return now.  Oh well....,5
B00Y0NGC1E,soft durable sock to above ankle. though  2 pair of the pack the elastic gave way and the socks slip into your shoe as you walk. very annoying.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,definitely a rebuy every time!,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"Seems to be wearing well, no holes yet.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,only socks i buy now,5
B00Y0NGC1E,great value,5
B00Y0NGC1E,They are comfortable and fit to size.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Hanes Men's Double Tough Ankle Socks is good basic socks for a good price.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Nice set of socks-wish the toe area was a bit stronger as hubby makes holes there first.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,great,5
B00Y0NGC1E,THEY FIT,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"I needed some simple, plain black socks. No logos, no designs, no emblazoned allegiance to a brand. Not short, no-show, not halfway up the calf, just ankle socks.And here they are.",4
B00Y0NGC1E,Best comfortable socks for a big and tall men with cushions,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"I have big old feet and most brands of socks don't fit me despite saying they are my size. These Hanes socks are perfect, they fit well, are breathable, and do not disintegrate and start tearing or ripping (typically near the ankles) like a lot of other sock brands I have tried. I have bought a few packages of these in the past and these will remain my go-to in the future.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Christmas present for son.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Paid less than I would have at a local store. They seemed to have stretched out a bit after first wear and wash cycle.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,Bought for my husband who has small feet. Size 6 1/2 or 7 shoe size. Label says size 6-12 shoe. I knew I was taking a chance  but when I got them I was surprised at how long they are.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,"We pretty much all wear socks with our sneakers, so might as well be comfortable. These are great - soft and warm. Keep their shape, even when washed repeatedly. Great product, great price, and great service! Thank you!",5
B00Y0NGC1E,My go to sock,4
B00Y0NGC1E,these are comfy and last and last.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"Every few years I throw away all my socks and buy new ones. I replaced all of my socks with these and really like them. Great fit, great ankle height, and they don't stretch out over time. When it's time to rebuy socks in a few years, I'll reorder these.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Fits my feet fine,5
B00Y0NGC1E,They're soft and comfortable,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Wish there was more cushioning,4
B00Y0NGC1E,"great fit, uses it everyday",4
B00Y0NGC1E,Do you like to have socks on your feet? Then oh boy do we have the product for you. These socks fit right on the typical foot creating a barrier between the gross sweaty disgusting sole of your shoe and the feet. I wouldn't recommend this product to people who don't have feet. Unless they like to make sock puppets. But to the average consumer. These socks are hard to beat!,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"The fit was good, however, material was thin. I can't imagine them lasting very long.",4
B00Y0NGC1E,These socks came in clear plastic bag with a Hanes cardboard inside.  The size was 12-14 but they fit snugger.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,Perfect size and fit!,5
B00Y0NGC1E,works well great fit,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"Fit perfect, very comfortable",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Will order again,5
B00Y0NGC1E,My husband has no complaints on these would recommend and affordable,4
B00Y0NGC1E,Used for going out or school,5
B00Y0NGC1E,I honestly bought these for someone so I'm not sure how great they are in quality but price-wise was not bad,4
B00Y0NGC1E,"These are very nice socks. They fit without being super tight, and the length is just right. The only downside I found is they are a little thinner than I expected. I haven't had them long enough to know if that will impact wear but time will tell. If you are expecting, and are satisfied with, a mid grade sock these are for you.",4
B00Y0NGC1E,I learned not to go for price when purchasing socks when I did I received some that were paper thin. These are comfortable and hold up well after washing them several times. They are not the cheapest but they are not the most expensive. I have had good luck with Hanes products.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,I wear a 9 1/2 to 10 shoe & these are thin & super floppy.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,"I've reordered these 3 times over the last 8 years. The first set lasted 3, then 2ish, the last set I ordered was in 2023. They're all worn out already, all have holes in the heels. I don't even work on my feet as much as I used to, I sit at a desk. Quality has gone down. I'm looking for more durable socks now.",3
B00Y0NGC1E,Very comfortable but if you're on the smaller side they will fit but be so long you'd think a giant owned them.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,I buy these for my autistic son. I have them delivered once a month. My son wears his socks all the time and they do wear out quickly. This way he always has a new pair.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Socks fit comfortably,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Been using Hanes for a long time but this batch seems a little thinner then my ones that are starting to wear out.  I usually buy these at Walmart and thought that these may be factory rejects as they are the first time I have bought them from Amazon but they will do.  I mention factory rejects because when I buy Puffs Ultra Soft tissue through Amazon they always seem to be rejects as the ones from Walmart are perfect.  Who knows?  Will be interesting to see how long they last though.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,These are so comfortable. My son loves them. They arw soft and fit really well. The height is great for any everyday shoe.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,I gave 4 stars The socks are not as thick as  sketchers yet they are a good pick and good price.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,I wear a size 13.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,They washed up well-shrunk very very little.  Fabric feels nice.  This type of sock can be hard to find.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,Soft and cushiony. Seems well made.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"These are great, low black socks that I wear with black leggings and a darker sneaker in the winter. They are short on the ankle but higher than the shoe. I think they are perfect for us women!",5
B00Y0NGC1E,"These socks don't last a year.  So, that means after 25-30 wears, there will be a hole in these socks.  Because of the price, I don't mind.  But, that doesn't scream ""Double Tough"" To me.",3
B00Y0NGC1E,Bought while on sale and well worth it. Good socks.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,I was disappointed in the thickness of these socks.  They are thinner than similar socks I've bought n the past and I don't expect these to last anywhere near as long as others I have purchased.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,"I have worn Hanes socks for over two decades, and as of late they are suffing in quality. I ordered a package of these a few months ago, and after only about 12 wears they started getting holes in the soles.  It was also the same on the previous package, but I wanted to give it one more shot.  It did not used to be like this - they previously would last me years, and now they last only months.  Sad to say I after all these years I will be looking for a new brand for socks.",2
B00Y0NGC1E,My dog enjoyed eating the toe out of one of the socks I accidentally left on the floor.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,The socks are really thin. My husband doesn't mind so we kept them even tho the description says double thick.,3
B00Y0NGC1E,I buying socks on Amazon cause I can't get more for low good quality socks for a good price the fit perfectly and support my ankle well,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Perfect pick for all soldiers,5
B00Y0NGC1E,My husband loves these socks t keep his fee warm,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Fit as expected,4
B00Y0NGC1E,can as advertised,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"I bought these because I am a 12.5 EEEE size foot.  I am diabetic, and all the others ive tried are either too tall, or have so much stretch that it cuts off circulation.  These are a perfect fit for me.  fit snug without squeezing my foot.  I'll order more for sure!",5
B00Y0NGC1E,So far wash and wear well,4
B00Y0NGC1E,Very comfortable socks love them,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Good comfortable socks that fit fine.  Just started wearing them and therefore unable to comment on durability and wear.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"As someone who is constantly on their feet, finding the right socks is essential for comfort and performance. Thankfully, the Hanes Men's X-temp Cushioned Ankle Socks deliver on both fronts and then some! From their superior comfort to their impressive durability, these socks have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe.",4
B00Y0NGC1E,"For years I've gotten white and black ankle socks, worn 24/7. Some were okay, some got out of shape and ""holey"" easily.  But a DOZEN name-brand ""HANES"" for less than big-box cheapo's?  Count me a believer.  I have big feet (and size 13-15 fit perfectly. Wearing well and now I can go 3 weeks (24 pairs of socks) without mandating extra laundry day.  I am sold on them.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Sized correctly for my size 13 feet.  Go with the 12 to 14 size.,4
B00Y0NGC1E,Great quality.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"These socks are pretty basic and not flashy, but they are flexible and are easy to put on. I have a size 11 shoe and they are a good fit. Not sure at this point how well they will wear, but at this price I won't mind replacing them if they don't last a long time.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,"The 3 men in my family like these socks.  The wear of these socks is incredible, last a long time.",5
B00Y0NGC1E,Most socks fit 6-12. Hard to imagine that those two different size feet would wear the same socks comfortably. These socks fit my size 13WW just fine. Thanks,5
B00Y0NGC1E,Is a bit of a thin sock as expected.  These are good summertime socks and fit nicely at a good price.I was pleased with this purchase and would order them again.,5
B00Y0NGC1E,"This is a good product.  Nice fit, thickened sole, and comfortable for work. I will likely purchase again.",5
B00JUM4CT4,Love the color but pulling very badly. Very sad because I love sweatshirt jacket but it was economy one and it shows.,2
B00JUM4CT4,"I purchased a black hoodie in the same style but more casual. This color is perfect for morning walks or trips to the gym. It doesn't absorb sun's heat very much. The quality is excellent, and the price is reasonable. It matches well with another item from the same brand.The hoodie provides good protection against cold and wind, with a soft interior and exterior. I've washed it a few times so far without any issues, and it maintained its true size and fit after the first wash. The zipper functions smoothly, and I'm pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the product.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"The hoodie fit well enough, but it had a lot of loose threads that I had to burn off with a lighter.  It also had at least a dozen small white specs throughout where the dye didn't take or got bleached somehow.  Not happy.",1
B00JUM4CT4,"Good sweatshirt, I sized up as I like oversized. Hanes quality. Don't put it in the dryer and it will last. Color more mint or aqua green",4
B00JUM4CT4,"This is a fantastic value.  The hoodie is very good-looking and quite lightweight for how warm it is.  My wife has already threatened to steal it from me, as it is substantially softer than any other that she owns. It layers very well for these cold winter days, and I will probably be buying more in other colors. I've only had it a few days, so I cannot really comment on durability, but it seems well-made, and in my experience Hanes products tend to hold up quite well.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"Comfortable, lightweight, warm, and inexpensive. Great value! Probably 5, but is anything really perfect?",4
B00JUM4CT4,If you plan to use the pockets do not buy this product. My wallet sticks out they are so small,1
B00JUM4CT4,"It's true to size, it adds an extra layer to my always frigid body, and I love the color. I could have gotten away with a smaller size if I didn't have to put it over so many shirts. I'm 5' 10"" and about 220 pounds.",5
B00JUM4CT4,Sleeve ripped third use,1
B00JUM4CT4,"I can't believe I paid this much for this so-so hoodie, could have gotten a better hoodie for half the price from TEMU",3
B00JUM4CT4,"La tela es de mala calidad, en poco tiempo y casi sin usarla, la tela se llena de bolitas y se ve mal.Muy decepcionado de la perdida de calidad de la marca Hanes.",1
B00JUM4CT4,Gift,2
B00JUM4CT4,"Really like this hoody.  I am 5'10"" at 205.  The large has plenty of room without being too baggy.  The sleeves are may be a little long, but the snug fitting cuffs stay right where they belong.  The material is 50% cotton and looks great.  The charcoal heather gray is the nice dark shade of gray I was looking for.  For $13,  I can't imagine a better value.  If you are looking for a heavy winter sweatshirt, keep looking.  If you want something for cool fall/spring days, this one does it well and looks good.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"very soft texture on the inside, the hood is actually slightly proportionately larger than they usually are on hoodies - it's not huge, but you could comfortably wear a thick toque under it without feeling like it's pulling on itself to stretch and it has enough slack around the neck when fully zipped to wear a scarf without feeling knotted up.for other small people: 5'3"" 115lbs man gives the 'Small' size on this a thumbs up for correct proportions. it actually feels like regular sized hoodies look like they probably feel on regular sized adults, just scaled down for smaller adults.for larger people who might be a bit confused at why a small men's hoodie fitting a small man would be noteworthy: finding properly fitting clothing as a small adult is a bit of a PITA because some companies, instead of making smaller versions of their products for adults, instead also make kids' clothes of the same designs and then send the 'large kids' version of the kid's product to people who order the 'small adult' version of the adult product... so everyone else gets to sound satisfied with a given product, but small adults kind of just have to regularly expect the probability of being lied to about what they're paying for and potentially ending up with something that is not designed to comfortably fit on an adult body shape. this particular company did not do that, and it is much appreciated.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"It looks nice, is comfortable,  cheaper than the box stores, medium weight, and I got a size bigger and it was just roomy enough and true to size.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"Nice, soft, lightweight jacketI was surprised that the pockets are rather shallow when I lost my wallet. It fell out of the pocket between the car seats the first time I wore it",4
B00JUM4CT4,"I ordered this hoodie for myself because I kept stealing my husband's hoodie. I looked at the hoodies for women and even ordered one but the material was thinner than I wanted and unfortunately, the zipper was broken. So I thought, why not get the kind of hoodie I've been stealing from my hubby? So, I found this awesome men's hoodie which fits beautifully (I'm 5'8"", 145 lbs, and wanted it to be just a little loose) and has a wonderful cozy inner liner that is perfect for chilly weather. Right now our mornings are in the high 40's and this hoodie is perfect. Very happy with it. Love the color (I got dark grey) and love the price. Definitely recommend!",5
B00JUM4CT4,"The product came in sealed plastic, but someone else had worn it before. There were blonde hairs all over the jacket; I got black. I have dark hair. I washed it twice just in case, but the jacket itself is fine. This is just an FYI for anyone who might be uncomfortable with this.It didn't shrink in the dryer. It isn't thick, so it won't keep anyone super warm. I run hot, so this is perfect for me. I also use it at the gym. The sipper works fine and glides really well. I am on the shorter side, but the arms fit well. They are a little long, but with the cuff, it's ""loose"" but not super baggy. Overall, I like the jacket.",4
B00JUM4CT4,"I ordered this for my 90 yr old Dad who gets cold quickly. He was needing a new full-zip sweatshirt and this was good for him. It is a little thin with 50% Polyester and 50% cotton, I was hoping for a little heavier material but it will work. It has a nice fleece inside and the zipper is good quality. I really like that it has a reinforced grommet for the drawstring on the hoodie. We tide a knot on the ends of the drawstring to ensure that it doesn't pull through.I ordered a large and it's true to size even after laundering. He is 6'1"" and the length of the sleeves fit him nicely. The cuffs on the sleeves and around the bottom of the waist aren't too tight or binding. The pockets are large and deep enough to hold his pipe and tobacco pouch without them falling out.I would recommend this Hanes Full-Zip hooded sweatshirt if you are looking for something lightweight.",4
B00JUM4CT4,"The hoodie is comfortable. It's thin, but works great as an office jacket. I ordered XXL and I think I should have ordered Large.  This XXL is giant and nearly swallows me. I'll try to wash it in hot water to see if it shrinks up a bit to fit a little better.",4
B00JUM4CT4,"Son bought this and wears it everyday. We don't have any shopping places locally to us, except for Walmart, so when he wanted a white sweater, we looked on Amazon. True to size, not very thick lining but provides the warmth he need. Comfortable and zips with ease. We wash in cold water, hang dry, and fabric is still like new.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"I love this hoodie. My other hoodies were snug in the arms and I couldn't layer long sleeves with them. I decided to get a mens 2xl hoodie. It's warm and cozy. My brother borrowed it and my husband can wear it, but I always repo it back.",5
B00JUM4CT4,Warm and cozy. Size XL fits just right. Long enough to fully cover my arms without being baggy.One suggestion though. I bought one as an office sweater. You might want to wash it before you wear it for the first time. The interior lining left lint all over my shirt.,4
B00JUM4CT4,"I have bought these plain zippered hoodies a couple times. They have held up well through activity, washing, and very regular use. They haven't pilled or gotten out of shape from washing. They didn't shrink either. My son stole my last one or I would still have it.",5
B00JUM4CT4,"Lininhg nice.  Loose, but could zip up higher.  Pockets shallow.  Didnt wash yet. Fairly warm.  Not much good in the wind",4
B00JUM4CT4,"It is a great value for the cost, thinner for more temperate climates.  The hood is unlined, so if you pull it up the fleecy insides of a sweatshirt will be in contact with your hair/ head.  The pockets are on the smaller side.  It is perfect for the workaday throw over your clothes to add another layer for warmth use; I would go with something a bit nicer if you needed more functionality/were using it in actuallybinclement weather, etc.",4
B00JUM4CT4,I have several hoodies and this is by far the best value. Very well made for the price when compared to other brands,4
B00JUM4CT4,I like it very simple not bulky at all simply great and the price too,5
B00JUM4CT4,"I love this jacket. It is light enough to keep me warm, but not hot, so I wear it all the time. I added pony beads to the end of the strings to ""fancy it up."" I order a size up because I wear it for comfort and don't have to worry about shrinkage. This is my second Hanes sweat jacket, different color. I would recommend.",5
B00JUM4CT4,Had a soft feel but poor quality,4
B00JUM4CT4,I liked the fit but two washings and it looks bad. Threads are coming loose.,4
B00JUM4CT4,"A good weight for transitional weather in Florida!  Hoodie is great for windbreaker gusts.  Zipper is heavy duty.  The length  is hip length.Since it was fire engine red, I pre-washed in warm water to make sure the red dye was set.  Color has remained fixed and vivid red 10 washings later.",5
B00JUM4CT4,Got this for my dad and he absolutely loves it. The price is great for the quality. Fits perfect and soft.,5
B00JUM4CT4,Basic and comfortable. Great price.,4
B00JUM4CT4,"Pretty good, sheds a lot before the first few washes.  Sizing is a tad on the large side -- feels a little wide and dumpy around the midsection, but this is a comfort item not a fashion item.  The price is definitely right.  Super soft.  A bit thin so it won't hold up well in really cold temps on its own.",4
B00JUM4CT4,For just right,5
B00JUM4CT4,I ordered for my husband. Size is true to fit. Very soft and comfy.,5
B00JUM4CT4,Sweatshirt is lightweight and comfortable. Loved it.,5
B00JUM4CT4,Comfy feels great and keeps you nice and warm,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Cheap in price but not in quality.  I've purchased inexpensive shirts and pull over sweaters on Amazon and the fit has been poor, usually weird in the shoulders, and binding in odd places when I move, as if someone cut out two dimensional paper doll clothes and stitched them together.  That is not the case with these shirts.  They fit well and are comfortable in motion.  The design is minimalist, in a good way.  I love the tagless tags that are printed into the fabric so they don't chafe the back of my neck although the white printing on the heather gray shirt is difficult to see so it takes a few seconds to ensure I don't put the shirt on backwards.  These shirts breathe well and have a quality silky feel because of the tightly woven synthetic material, but are durable even though they're fairly thin.  These are great sunscreen without any greasy smelly mess.  I bought a similar name brand long polyester sleeve shirt in the mid 1980's for sunscreen when rock climbing, and paid almost as much (much more after accounting for inflation) as I paid for these six shirts, and honestly, I like these shirts better.Note that the black shirts are a dark navy blue.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Color options, quality of fabric, and price are the main reasons for buying these shirts. If you need another purpose; your wife will love them on you.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,Purchased to complete a trip to South Dakota where the morning weather can be very cool and afternoons very hot. These shirts worked very well. Easy to layer and cool in warmer temps. Quality construction and true to size. Good value.,4
B0CN2VVBV6,Perfect sleep shirt and undershirt during winter. Easy care.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Very nice and comfortable.At that price I was worried, but so far so good..Great fit and keeps me warm skiing.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,I've been very pleased with this collection of long sleeve shirts. I wear them primarily in colder weather as warm undershirts. The sewing and workmanship is good quality and I'm happy with the value.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,Wear them under my scrubs. Great no complaints. Comfortable. Not too warm. Just right for me.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"I ordered these to wear to the gym in he winter.  I was tired of the same ole black, gray, and limited color options. I wanted something that could stand up to sweat, fit comfortably, and serve its purpose. And of course match the different colored pants I also purchase.  I am happy and it is a win, win indeed...",4
B0CN2VVBV6,"I've now been wearing these shirts to play pickleball for a few weeks and they're great. They feel good, really work to wick away sweat and dry almost immediately. It would seem that it couldn't be possible that you can buy good shirts for such an inexpensive price, but these are great shirts and the price is fabulous.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,"I,m 5'-8"" 125lb gray hair, Small size fits just perfect nice colors good quality.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Bought these for my husband.  They really work.  After he works up a sweat, the breeze evaporates it and he feels cool the rest of the day.  Great idea.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,Good buy very nice,5
B0CN2VVBV6,They re nice and all just a bit to loss,4
B0CN2VVBV6,Excelente,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"So, based on some reviews, I originally ordered one size up an XL, but they were way too big. I re-ordered a large and they fit perfectly. These are great shirts to wear to the gym. These are comparable to some of the name brand workout shirts that I have purchased in the past.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,Great value,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"1 of the 6 shirts is smaller than the rest, it says XL but is probably a large, but they are good quality, that was the only issue i had with them",4
B0CN2VVBV6,Awesome shirts!,5
B0CN2VVBV6,Very comfortable,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"6 shirts for roughly 33.00 is a steal.  The sizes run true, I wear a large and it fit perfectly. Casual wear that looks good for a good price",5
B0CN2VVBV6,My son loves these shirts! Comfortable and a great value,5
B0CN2VVBV6,my son uses the for work and loves them they run big.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,The materials were impressive.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"I bought another brand here a while back, these are much better. Decent size weight, something that looks like it will last. Good value",5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Super comfortable, Love how they look. Way better than my dated t's",5
B0CN2VVBV6,Like the comfort of the shirts.  Colors are fine as well.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"These are excellent, can't beat the price",5
B0CN2VVBV6,Very nice shirts,5
B0CN2VVBV6,We cut the back to make it easy to get on and off and regulate her temperature. I'm wearing one now over a t-shirt to keep warm.,5
B0CN2VVBV6,These fit and feel like Nike or UA but without the price tag!,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Quick ship, priced appropriately, material satin was the only negative thing personally. Preference a cotton like, not sheen material. Great seller.",4
B0CN2VVBV6,Just whatnI wanted,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Love the collection of colors. Here in NC the winters are not too cold, so on the chillier days where you might need a little more than SS shirt, these are perfect. I'm 6', 245 and these are a perfect fit.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,"These shirts fits perfectly, keeps you warm and very comfortable",5
B0CN2VVBV6,Bastante elasticidad,5
B0CN2VVBV6,Comfortable and warm without being too warm,5
B0CN2VVBV6,I have melanoma skin cancer instead of using sun block Lotion. I use these shirts they work very well without the need to Rob chemical to my skin. Yes it's hot in the shirts But it's a win win and I just hydrate often. If you're looking for an alternative other than Chemicals this is your answer,5
B0CN2VVBV6,Omg the fabric is so soft and very light weight,5
B0CN2VVBV6,I was expecting a heavier tee,4
B0CN2VVBV6,"Tshirts are of great quality,  bright colors, fabric feels good,  this are for work, but are ideal to go anywhere, I'll recommend this.",5
B0CN2VVBV6,I wear these all year round. I work outside in the sun these keep the sun from sunburn on my arms.,5

B0CN2VVBV6,I use them in the summer to keep the sun off my skin and they also work well on the chilly winter days. Good value,5
B0CN2VVBV6,"Neck opening too big, low cut.",4
B0CN2VVBV6,"There is always room for improvement, but I can find no complaints. These shirts fit and wear well. They are on no way misrepresented and are of a fine standard for this Amazon platform.It is in fact a fine product and affordable.",4

B06Y1SRPGF,"I recently had the opportunity to try out the Elite Rash Guard, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. As an avid athlete, I understand the importance of having reliable and durable gear, and this rash guard truly delivers on all fronts.One of the standout features of the Elite Rash Guard is its impressive thickness. Unlike other rash guards I've worn in the past, this one feels substantial and provides an extra layer of protection. Whether I'm practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or grappling, I can feel confident knowing that my skin is shielded from potential mat burn and abrasions.The durability of the Elite Rash Guard is truly remarkable. The material used is of exceptional quality, allowing it to withstand the rigors of constant movement, stretching, and even occasional friction. I appreciate that I can rely on this rash guard to maintain its performance and longevity over time.What sets the Elite Rash Guard apart from many others is its impressive stretchiness. The fabric has an excellent elasticity, which enables a full range of motion without feeling restricted. Whether I'm executing complex submissions or performing dynamic movements, this rash guard moves with my body, providing the flexibility I need to perform at my best.One of the most ingenious design features of the Elite Rash Guard is its waistband. This clever addition prevents the rash guard from riding up your torso during intense workouts or grappling sessions. It's incredibly frustrating when your gear constantly shifts, requiring frequent adjustments. However, with this rash guard, I can focus solely on my training without any distractions. The waistband ensures a secure fit, allowing me to stay focused and maintain optimal performance.In addition to the protective and comfort aspects, the Elite Rash Guard also prioritizes hygiene. By wearing this rash guard, I minimize the spread of bacteria and other contaminants on the mat. The fabric's moisture-wicking properties help keep me dry, preventing the buildup of sweat and odor. I appreciate this attention to detail, as it contributes to a cleaner training environment for both myself and my training partners. I highly recommend the Elite Rash Guard. It's a worthwhile investment that will undoubtedly enhance your training experience and keep you performing at your best.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Got this rash guard to the other day for a rank rash guard. This thing lasted 2 hours of teaching and went on to kill it for a hour of rolling. I highly recommend getting one of these today. This will go to the top of rotation. It kept me dry in all the classes. It tight enough to let me slide about, but loosen enough to not cut off circulation. It has a little sticky part to at the bottom of the waist to keep it from sliding up. In my book that top notch stuff.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Very happy with the quality and the value.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,I needed a new rash guard and this one did not disappoint. Elite products are great for the money. High quality materials and fit well. I'm looking forward to many training sessions wearing my new gear.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"The Rashguard is light and flexible and I love the purple!!! It's just as advertised, which is wonderful!!! I plan on getting more items from Elite soon!!! I am 5'4 and 132lbs and I ordered a medium!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Everything went according to plan and the product arrived earlier than expected as well as it fit perfectly. Simone was just wonderful to work with and I expect to go business with them again!,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"This rashguard is great! Arrived quickly and actually fits. Definitely trust their size chart if you are hesitant. Stitching all looks good and straight. Material is very nice as well. Not paper thin, not a wet suit! 5 of 5 would recommend!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Fits perfect  and is vert breathable,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"This rashguard is perfect for my needs. As a wrestler and grappler of many years, finding quality gear to roll in is difficult.The comfort of the apparel is top notch, allowing me to compete at a high level at all times.My height and weight are 5'6'' & 165lbs respectively, and I ordered size M; it fits perfectly.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I am  5'6"" and 135 lbs, and the medium size fits me perfectly!""",5
B06Y1SRPGF,The elite rash guard is elite . Good fit and very comfy. The skin tight long sleeve makes training very comfortable . I would recommend to everyone and you will not be disappointed one bit,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Love this rash guard! Great fit, I used the sizing chart, and I love the elastic band detail at the bottom- keeps it down and doesn't run up my back during any movement.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Nice rash guard feels comfortable I like having sleeves purple looks good people think im a purple belt just for wearing it lol,5
B06Y1SRPGF,I got this rash guard for BJJ practices. Love the purple color! The material is very comfortable. I like that the rash guard has a tight band around the bottom so it stays in place during practice. Very happy with the purchase!,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Just received these rash guards. They fit well, and they have a waistband that helps keep them in place. They are breathable and snug, but not too tight.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I love Elite products! This rashguard fits perfectly, and I love training with it!  One of my favorite things about elite is the price, quality and the availability. Highly suggest!!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"By far one of the best value compression shirt for MMA/BJJ. Nice, thick material with heavy stitching. I also have the compression pants and shorts. Same quality for all of them. I have RDX shorts and Sanabul compression pants. Both are not as thick and with initial feel, doesn't seem like they will last as long.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Very little to not like about these rash guards. Quality, price, fit, all great. The best part that doesn't get mentioned enough in reviews or even the marketing is the thick cuff at the bottom hem. It doesn't wonders at keeping it tucked in and not riding up. By far the best feature.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,The fit and the quality is perfect for regular training. It withstands the wear and tear of love rolls well.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Great product, very comfortable",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I've rolled in this several times now and am happy with the feel!Sizing: I followed Elite's chart and it's a good fit. Have some trust in their sizing-- I normally do a small and was glad I looked at the chart. I'm 5'10"" 145 and medium is fitted but not tight and plenty long for my tall frame.Material: The black is a really nice thick material (though not heavy) and the sleeves are a bit thinner. The gray is not thin enough that it's see-through if you wear something beneathBreathability: I've not overheated rolling and was even fine wearing it for a run outside (summer). The material seems to stay decently cool while active and dry quickly after.Stretch/Movement: Mine has withstood lots of Kimuras and Omeplatas... I'm not worried about its flexibility.Wash: I don't dry my gear, but have washed it twice without issue (a couple hanging threads, but no big deal)Bonus Features: There's an elastic band at the bottom-- not tight enough to squeeze ya, just enough to help keep it down as you roll. I'm also a fan of the logo placement-- it's visible but not obnoxious, and there's a little patch of additional Elite Sports trademarking just under the collar on the back (minimalistic-- I like it)",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Love the fit and how they feel! Great purchase!,5
B06Y1SRPGF,My 16yr old son competes in kickboxing and karate. He wore the rashguard to fight class and was very happy. It's light weight and the material is comfortable. It doesn't bunch up or restrict his movements Definitely will order more colors.He is 5'9 and weighs 145-150 he got an adult size small,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Fits great, made out of a high grade material. I will be ordering more of these to replace my old ones!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"This thing is great! I have another brand that I had gotten but it came time for a new one and I figured that I would give it a shot. Blown away. The quality feels great, the wrists are tight, as well as the band around the bottom. I feel like this will last many training sessions and will probably work for other sports as well, I am thinking scuba. Will update after I get some use and get to test durability and longevity!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,It wouldve been 5 stars if only the ELITE logo didnt start to peel of otherwise a good rashgaurd to roll in.Ossssss,4
B06Y1SRPGF,"This is my 3rd rashguard from Elite as I have 2 short sleeves and now a long sleeve. The fit is great and the magnet at the bottom of the rashguard helps to keep in it place and prevents it from riding up your shorts or gi pants. I've used for both training and competing and have no complaints and the price point is great, especially for ranked rashguards. I'll be purchasing more in the future.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"This is a high quality long sleeve rash guard, the comfort is amazing, I love the band that keeps the shirt from coming up while grappling or doing any active movement. 10/10 recommend!!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,All around great product I recommend it,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I always was curious about the Elite brand as its logo resembles that of car manufacturers such as Bentley and Genesis. Though the similarity exists in the emblem, it also makes you feel like you are in one of those exotic cars. The rash guard fits right and is breathable with no tightness. It is easy to remove as compared to others that require a huge amount of effort to take off.  It is just what I wanted as you cannot go wrong with the product description and the size chart.  The material itself is high quality when compared to other rash guards I have that pickup lint and fibers when washed together with other fabrics.  I really love the color I bought which is plain black as it adds a sense of masculinity and boldness.  I have to say by the way, I got a bargain for the price I paid for it.  I said this only by comparing its price to other brands.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Great rashguard! The fit is perfect, and the material is durable yet comfortable. It stays in place during rolls and dries quickly after training. The design is also sharp, getting compliments every time I wear it.Highly recommend for any BJJ practitioner!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Love the fit . The bottom elastic band keep it from ridding up when I roll.,4
B06Y1SRPGF,Rash Guard is durable and fits well. Perfect daily driver for hard training.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Recent purchase was the rash guard, elastic band at the base is a very nice touch to hold it in place. The GI has been my practice uniform for over 2 years, 3 nights a week and holding up well. I will buy again",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I recently purchased my first rash guard from Elite and I have been extremely satisfied!My only complaint is sizing. I normally wear a large, and this one was a little snug for my liking, so I will definitely size up next purchase!Overall great quality for heavy training sessions!Thank you Elite Sports!",4
B06Y1SRPGF,Quality ranked rashguard at an affordable price.Fits great and wicks sweat away nicely.Will buy more in the future.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,I like the feel of the material.  I also like the elastic at the bottom of the shirt.  It keeps the shirt from riding up.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I've been needing some new no-gi equipment since I lost a bag of clothes and seeing as how I train 6 days a week I can't afford to spend 60-70 dollars per piece of equipment. I'd seen people at tournaments wear Elite Sports gear and decided to try one out. I got to wear it for the first time today and I love it.The material is as good as or better than any other top name brands that I've had. The stitching it pretty smooth but seems sturdy and I didn't notice it at all while I was rolling. I even wore it under my gi with no issue and I usually don't wear a rash guard with the gi.The fit was true to size. Great fit in the torso, at 6'4, 200lbs the XL was just right. Not too loose or too baggy. It was also long enough for me to tuck in without it coming out while training. The sleeves could be a bit longer, but I have ridiculously long limbs and this still fits PERFECTLY as a 3/4 sleeve shirt (which I think I might like better than having fabric down on my wrist during a no-gi exchange).All in all I'm going to give this a 10/10 for the price point. If you're looking to stock up on some good gear, like I'm about to do after I post this, Elite Sports is where its at.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Mostly fine for this price point but after 1 use stitching in the neck and wrist is coming loose so I am not optimistic about long term derability. I would probably opt for something costing a little more if I knew the quality would be better.,3
B06Y1SRPGF,A fair price for quality rash guards,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Great product, the material is really nice and durable, will definitely buy more in the future",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"The fabric has the perfect thickness, providing ideal coverage and breathability. It stays securely in place during training, thanks to a well-designed elastic band that prevents it from riding up.Comfort is key, with a snug fit that isn't too tight, making it perfect for intense training. The sleek black color is rich and stylish, adding to its appeal.Overall, this rash guard offers great value with its performance, durability, and design. It's a worthwhile investment for any serious jiu-jitsu athlete looking to upgrade their gear.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"This is a very nice quality rashguard! The fit through the torso was great, I got a 2x and am 5'6 and 230. The only thing I will note is that the length is very long also. It comes down to below my hips but that's no problem since it's tucked into shorts anyway! The material feels very thick and doesn't feel like it's going to wear out from rolling on the mats.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Great fit and smooth feel!,5
B06Y1SRPGF,Fits well. Got this for rowing and it works great. Moves comfortably.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,This product has great quality. The fit is perfect. The rashguard is not too thin or thick. It's perfect for wearing under the bjj gi or as a no gi top.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I typically prefer short sleeve rashguards because the long sleeve rashies I've worn previously bunch up at the wrist and slip over my hands. This elite long sleeve rashie surprised me how great it felt: not too tight, not too tight, and it had a little bit of elastic around the wrist area to prevent the sleeve from sliding past my wrist! I liked the elastic waistband too so the rashie stayed put and didn't ride up during a roll. Super breathable!!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"A rash guard is an essential part of your training gear, both gi and no-gi.  A good rash guard can not only help extend the life of your BJJ gi by keeping sweat from accumulating and staining it, but can also provides a layer of protection from chafing and help maintain good skin hygiene.  The last thing you want to do is lose days training because of something easily preventable.  Spend more time repping and less time worrying about your gear.  The same can be said for the Elite Sports IBJJF Ultra Light BJJ Brazilian Jiu Jitsu GiOf the gis that I have purchased in the past, this is by far the lightest and in turn it makes my movements feel less confined.  The Elite Sports Ultra Light Bjj gi's fit and finish is also clean and neat.  Right out of the box, the gi is ready to go.  A big plus is the drawstring tie on the pants. If you've ever found yourself with untied pants in the middle of a rep or roll and forced to stop to tie them, you know how annoying that can be.  It may be a small detail, but its the small details that matter.  Of course, the price point on this gi is great as well.  Nothing is worse than the feeling of buyers remorse.  The Elite Sports Ultra Light BJJ gi and Rash Guard give you durability and quality without putting the squeeze on your wallet.  Save those for the mat.  Get the right gear for the job.  Go Elite.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Brown belt and I have been training for the past 8 years. I have owned multiple brands of rash guards over that time and Elite is one that I go back to repeatedly. The fit matches their charting guide and the quality matches the grind. Great investment for the price. I am old school and like to traditional style. Buy it and train hard.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,I absolutely love this rash gaurd for wearing under my Gi. I have bought other long sleeve rash gaurds before but only had a few due to the cost of them. I also love designs and decals on them but over time of wearing them and washing them the decals start fading or coming off. The simple design and cost of this one means I can afford to get multiples so I don't have to wash one constantly. I also love the band at the bottom of the shirt. I have had issues when wearing other brands that dont have this feature and they slowly ride up till the shirt is almost up to my belly button not on this one though. Super happy with this pursschase and would suggest others to try it.,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I have purchased products from mutliple categories with Elite, Wrestling Singlet, Combat short, workout sand bags and now this long sleeve Rash Guard. I don't know how Elite can sell such quality products and ask the small prices they do. I don't know how they do it but I hope they never stop.Christopher Pratt",5
B06Y1SRPGF,works great for both grappling and striking highly recommend for all training,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"The rashguard fits well, it's a little short in the arms but most things are on me. It doesn't ride up when you are rolling. Would purchase again.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I needed something for grappling part in Buhurt training. Definitely worth it. It's being used heavy and been through number of washes, no tears. It's been few months and still holds up good.",4
B06Y1SRPGF,"I wore this as a rashie under my gi for BJJ practice and I was pleased with how it performed.The material feels thick and good quality but it wears light, like a second skin. The stitching feels very secure and the flat stitch prevented it from being itchy or bothersome. I loved the extra thickness on the bottom that kept the shirt from rolling up and my training partner's fingers from getting caught in it. All around a solid product.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"One of the things I love about this company is the sizing. As someone with unique size and length (I'm a big guy, but short limbs), this company continues to crush it. This not only fit well, but is super comfortable. One of my favorite things about this rash guard is the waist band built into it. It prevents the material from sliding up during sparring and rolling, which is something more robustly people struggle with in typical rash guard material. In addition to how it fits and feels, it's of a decent thickness so it lives up to its moniker of being a true rashguard, and as someone who trains and gets Matt burn regularly, its a welcome reprieve. Well done.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Good edge material,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"I am a slightly curvy woman so I ordered a large. The rash guard fit my chest, arms, and waist pretty well. The material is thick and feels secure, which is huge for me. I don't do skimpy spandex ever. I like that the shirt is tagless and washes and dries easily.My only small complaint/suggestions would be that the arm length feels a little short, making the fit seem a little generic. It would also be amazing if the thick seem at the bottom had a no slip grip material on the inside as some other brands do. My shirt rolled up every time I rolled with someone, which is very distracting when I like to keep covered up.",4
B06Y1SRPGF,"Elite always delivers! This product is cheap but super good quality. I love the rubber grip on the bottom that keeps it from slipping and it's very light material, but tough so it's comfortable and durable! Great for BJJ! Recommend to anyone!",5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Have not used the rash guard yet in practice, but can speak to the sizing.  At 5'10"" and 165 lbs, the medium size fit perfectly for me for those that like a tighter fit (even though the size chart recommends a large).  I don't like the rash guard too loose.",5
B06Y1SRPGF,Elite gear never disappoints. I love that the rash guard comes in a long sleeve option and is color ranked. It's something a know I can train and compete in. The elastic waste band is also a huge selling point for me. I'm comfortable knowing it won't ride up while I'm rolling. The material feels great and is perfect to wear under the gi or to use for no gi. I'll definitely be ordering more equipment from Elite Sports!!,5
B06Y1SRPGF,"Super light weight, and nothing for opponent to grip. Helps keep cool and dries quickly.",5
B086KXNGKY,I bought these shirts and I'm so glad I did.They are super soft and I am able to wear them to work as well as just relaxing at home.The heather colors look really good and I have received compliments on the various colors.So far the quality of them has been outstanding. No frays or lose strings at all.They fit me perfect and don't make my stomach stick out at all which is nice. The cut is also perfect and sits right at the waist. The sleeves make my arms look good without being too tight.The functionality of being able to wear them at work or at home relaxing is perfect.I'm very happy with my purchase!,5
B086KXNGKY,"I like plain t-shirts, and I like pockets. These are both of those things.Oh, and they're also very comfortable, not too hot in the summer, and are a little longer. Which is great for me since I'm a tall, skinny dude.",5
B086KXNGKY,"These shorts were a great bargain for the money.  My one nitpick is that the fit of each shirt is noticeable different, when they should be identical.  Although they all fit me.  Outside of that I have no complaints and on balance am pleased with my purchase.",4
B086KXNGKY,"You can never have too many. They are comfortable. Wish they were a little thicker, but they are great during the hot summer months.",5
B086KXNGKY,"These are good shirts. I always order a little larger than I need and these were a little smaller than other 3XL shirts I have bought, but as I said I usually can wear a 2XL fine but order big just to be safe.",5
B086KXNGKY,"Thanks to Mounjaro and a lot of exercise, I lost 90 lbs. from May to November 2024.  That meant all of my XXL clothing now fit like a circus tent.  Replacing an entire wardrobe, including jeans, pants, shorts, work shirts, etc. is expensive, so price was a motivating factor.  Most of what I wear is just pocket t-shirts, because I'm a regular casual guy.  So I bought the Hanes Men's Cotton Crew Neck Pocket T-Shirt pack.These t-shirts are paper-thin.  Even after washing, they are not the thick Hanes shirts of the old days.  The colors are flattering, and the price is great, but you definitely get what you pay for here.  Fine to maybe wear as an undershirt, but pretty weak as your only t-shirt.  Also, the sleeves are pretty short, even by t-shirt standards.  Fine for me, because I'm trying to show off the new bod, but for most people I think they would probably be a hair shorter than preferred.Three stars because they are a value for the money.  I bought 3-4 packs of them because of the price, and because I like the colors included.  Long-term these will definitely NOT be my shirt of choice.",3
B086KXNGKY,"ok fit but is thinner material, not the thicker material of older same Hanes pocket T-shirts I have, probably won't last as long as the thicker cotton ones but will do",4
B086KXNGKY,"Quality of assemble of shirts and materials used seemed to be good. Only issue I have is material is very thin, nothing I would wear out without having regular shirt over.",4
B086KXNGKY,They do shrink when washed.,4
B086KXNGKY,"These are pretty standard t-shirts. They are nice colors. But my son didn't want pockets, so we had to return. I like the pocket... :-)",4
B086KXNGKY,Very good,4
B086KXNGKY,"The 2 gray shirts are 2in longer than the rest of them. and the pocket on the blue shirt is crooked. The gray fits OK. (except sleeves) Then, there are the sleeves, that are shorter than the picture shows. They look more like sleeves for women's shirts. I don't believe I have never seen men's shirts with sleeves, that are this short. I like sleeveless shirts, during the Summer, but, you can no longer buy a regular sleeveless shirt, with a pocket. They all have the very large arm holes.(that I don't care for) The material is thin, as a few others pointed out. The previous Hanes shirts I have bought were much better quality, than these. By the chart, L should fit me. But I have been buying XL shirts, because I like them a little long. Judging by other reviewers, you can't go by the chart, at all. You have to buy them to find out if they are the right size, or not. They may be too small, just right, or too large.",3
B086KXNGKY,We had to return the original order because they seemed too small for the sizing stated. We increased the size and had them sent back to us. They are a nice material. Soft. Seems to wick away sweat well. Just order a size up.,4
B086KXNGKY,thin but works,4
B086KXNGKY,My 92 year old dad loves them. They fit comfortably,5
B086KXNGKY,True to size fitting. Very comfortable,5
B086KXNGKY,"Sizing was a bit inconsistent in some of the grey shirts, but hey they make good garage/under shirts for the price!",4
B086KXNGKY,"Shirts are nice but lighter and thinner than expected, my own fault for trying to save a buck and getting the ones labled as ""undershirts"" when all my others are ""heavy cotton"". They will be really nice for working outside in the summer.",5
B086KXNGKY,If you're using it as a base layer under other clothing it's acceptable. Otherwise the material is fairly thin.,4
B086KXNGKY,Summer wear in my area!,5
B086KXNGKY,Fix well and has a pocket,5
B086KXNGKY,The pockets were not sewn straight. Some were on crooked.,4
B086KXNGKY,Love these pocket t shirts. Will definitely order more.,5
B086KXNGKY,Use these for work. They are perfect and true to size.,5
B086KXNGKY,"Men's Undershirts are nice, fit well.",4
B086KXNGKY,"I know these are just Haynes T-shirts, but do you want to put a review on so far so good these have not shrunk. I know sometimes they do these so far have not and they still fit perfect",5
B086KXNGKY,Good quality got exactly what I paid for,4
B086KXNGKY,Used for my father as a layer with short and and long sleeve shirts and pullovers.,4
B086KXNGKY,These T SHIRTS are very soft and wear well. Husband was very pleased. Great price as well.,4
B086KXNGKY,Como siempre excelente,5
B086KXNGKY,Buena para uso diario en el hogar,4
B086KXNGKY,It's a pack of plain various colored Hanes pocket t-shirts you can't really expect much. They're ok quality but I learned 2 lessons from purchasing these shirts before.1. Order a size up from what you normally wear these shirts WILL SHRINK. They will shrink a decent amount. I learned the hard way the first  time.2. These are not the shirts to wear to work if you work a blue collar type of job it's just not cut out for being stretched or being put through hard work.3. Don't expect these shirts to last long my first pack that I purchased although those shirts don't fit perfect already have holes around the pocket.Overall these are decent shirts I don't regret my purchase and you get 6 shirts for a price that's hard to beat.,4
B086KXNGKY,Very comfortable,5
B086KXNGKY,recibi a mi entera satisfaccion,5
B086KXNGKY,"got a 6 pack, assorted colors. a bit longer than other tshirts, crew neck, wicking material to keep you dry.  Hane's has been in my life forever, never a bad product from them. i would buy again!",5
B086KXNGKY,These T-shirts are nice and the material isn't thin. The only problem I have with these are that they fit smaller than regular size T-shirts. I bought medium and should have purchased large. Nice quality made T-shirts.,4
B086KXNGKY,My son loves them. They wash well. The only negative is they're different material or texture. They're not all the same.,4
B086KXNGKY,"Kinda lightweight, but okay",4
B086KXNGKY,Still looking good after 6 months wash up nice and hold shape,5
B086KXNGKY,"Is exactly what they say, true to fit, even after cold wash, med drying, did not shrink",5
B086KXNGKY,"Softness,quantity and sturdy!",5
B086KXNGKY,"Se ven muy bien, la talla M me quedo perfecta en los hombros, y tambien de largo y de ancho (soy delgado y mido 1.85m). A pesar de que las lave antes de usar, hacen que me pique el cuerpo un poco si hace calor, no esperaba eso pues dice que son 100% algodon, pero por el precio creo que esta bastante bien",4
B086KXNGKY,Perfect for undershirts,5
B086KXNGKY,This is a good buy and worth the money.,5
B086KXNGKY,"While Hanes is normally a quality name brand, this 6 pack of pocket T-Shirts makes me question my purchase.  The issue I have is the material these shirts are made of is quite thin.  However, if they ""last"" as long as my thicker Jockey pocket T shirts, I would change my rating to 5 stars.  However, at the same time, if there wear out quicker, I would change my rating to 2 stars.  It's too early to establish a final rating, but my first impression is that they are going to wear out quickly.  While you can buy 6 of these shirts for the same price as buying 1 and a half Jockey T Shirts, if they don't last very long, the Jockey shirts may have been the best bargain.  I work in T Shirts all day, summer and winter so after a few washings I may write another review.",4
B086KXNGKY,"The material is a little thin, otherwise a good buy.",4
B086KXNGKY,The T-shirts are kind of thin.,4
B086KXNGKY,Good for summer time,5
B086KXNGKY,nice,4
B086KXNGKY,I like these tees as they are very reasonably priced and not so heavy that I sweat so bad.,4
B086KXNGKY,Good fit and very comfortable.  Son very pleased with them,5
B086KXNGKY,"The material seems a little bit on the thinner side.That being said, I use pocket t shirts for work, as the pocket comes in handy, and I think the value for the dollar is pretty good with these.Washed and worn a few times and they are currently holding up well. Time will tell regarding their longevity.Fit is pretty standard and they seem quite breathable.Overall I would recommend these for their price point.Hope this helps.",4
B086KXNGKY,I am kind of between a large and an extra large because I have long arms and a long torso.  If you're like me buy the extra large because they shrink a little.  I like the shirts.,4
B086KXNGKY,"Ok the reviews did not lie lol, these things really shrink. I ordered a large knowing they would probably shrink, when I received the shirts they fit like a XL but after a wash they fit like a medium which is fine. Good quality, comfortable and lightweight.",4
B086KXNGKY,Couldn't find these locally at the moment so I ordered online thinking they would be the same.  The size is good but the fabric is not as soft as the ones I have bought in the past even after washing them.  Shipping was on time.,4
B086KXNGKY,"Ordered XL but it's not even close, very tight. Good shirt not too thick just size off. Order next size so you should be ok.",3
B086KXNGKY,Good,4
B086KXNGKY,"Hubs needed pocket tees as a way to carry his diabetes pump close to G7 sensor, he was very pleased with these t-shirts.  They did not shrink after washing & drying.",5
B086KXNGKY,Great set comfortable shirts,4
B086KXNGKY,These cotton crew neck T-shirts are so soft and comfortable. I love the different colors and the fact that there is no tag in the back. They are definitely longer that regular T-shirts and stay tucked in so much better.,5
B086KXNGKY,For the money you can't beat them,4
B086KXNGKY,Good value. Good fit. Wish they had more variety in colors.,4
B086KXNGKY,Tshirts not as soft as they used to be. Fit was good.,4
B086KXNGKY,Works great,5
B086KXNGKY,Good shirts.,5
B086KXNGKY,Excellent,5
B086KXNGKY,"Stretchy, feels almost double knit.Not my usual experience with this brand.",4
B086KXNGKY,T shirt after washing it shrink up and don't fit right. To small,5
B086KXNGKY,"My Uncle loves them, nice colors too, fit is great",5
B086KXNGKY,"Size up for shrinkage. Quite a difference after first wash and then a touch more after second.Nice and soft but wow, now - tooooo small.",3
B086KXNGKY,These t-shirts with pockets are of great quality.  The come out of the pkg with a great smell!  They are very lightweight and comfortable.  They shirts are very versatile and fit well without being too clingy in your body!!,5
B086KXNGKY,"I normally love hanes products but these shirts were not normal quality. Washed and worn 2x before holes came and hems started busting...this is with delicate wash cycle and hang drying! They also seemed to shrink massively as well, super short after the 2nd wash. The colors were nice but the quality was not the hanes I know.",3
B086KXNGKY,Decent shirts for the price.,4
B086KXNGKY,Fits good I like the pocket on them seems little thin,4
B086KXNGKY,"They run a size small, after washing and drying. They appear to be of decent quality other than that.",3
B086KXNGKY,My dad only wears the colored t-shirts with pockets! So these were a hit!,5
B086KXNGKY,"Nice material, nice colors,, just what I needed.",4
B086KXNGKY,"Good price, seems to be made well.  My only complaint is that they aren't soft.  I suppose after many washings and dryings= hopefully they soften up a bit.",4
B086KXNGKY,The person I purchased them for is happy with them.,4
B086KXNGKY,A little too thin for me. Definitely a summer t-shirt. A little too big in size.,3
B086KXNGKY,"Comfortable, nice color and fit",5
B086KXNGKY,Perfect fit and so comfortable well made,5
B086KXNGKY,Fairly good feel and suze,4
B086KXNGKY,FIT WELL,4
B01H7HOS6U,"I have a love of sweat pants. Sleeping, the weekends, the work outs.  It's so easy to grab a pair of Walmart cheapies.Well, spend a little more, and feel where the quality is sacrificed for those thin rags from Wally World.The length is a little more then stated, but the waist size is right on.Great quality, great feel. A step up for sure.",5
B01H7HOS6U,"These are very nice, however, the cuffs at the ankles were a bit baggy and not very stretchy for a snug fit at the ankles. The side pockets also were very shallow and things keep falling out of them, IE: keys, a pen or just anything really. These joggers need bigger pockets or ZIPPERS ! Also, the tie cord at the waist needs to be a bit LONGER and on the OUTside of the pants. Other than that, they are soft and comfy, but I will consider another brand my next purchase of joggers. In addition, sellers on Amazon need to have a more STANDARDIZED METHOS FOR SIZING CLOTHES ! Size charts and the WAY items are sized is ALL over the place !! For this reason I do NOT buy clothing on Amazon where I need to have specific measurements. Amazon needs to fix this.",4
B01H7HOS6U,"As the title says, comfortable and warm. I ordered 2XL tall. Probably could of went with XL tall but I think they would of been too tight for my liking. IDK. They are a little long, but I would rather have long than short. Pockets deep enough to hold a phone or wallet securely. I'm gonna wash this pair on hot to shrink just a tiny bit and order some more.",5
B01H7HOS6U,My husbands favorite home pants.  He loves them so much we bought them in multiple colors.  Pockets are perfect for him to throw his keys and phone in to run to the store.  We buy them here since we get them the cheapest.  Material quality is great and washes without losing their color.  They fit lose on my husbands waste which he likes,5
B01H7HOS6U,"These sweats are great! I am wearing a pair right now, I wore them yesterday as well. The quality is very nice, material is very soft, very very comfy, very quality acceptable!! Def don't hesitate.. I am a female I weigh 150lbs I'm 5'8 and I am wearing a men's small, bought an extra pair accidentally for x-mas so i kept them for me. The men's small fits be really really great! I did buy some for my son and son in-law one is tall 160lbs, and one is short 120lbs. I got the size L for tall he loves them, Size small for the shorty and he loves them. FYI don't get ""big and tall"" unless your man is 63 with VERY LONG LEGS I did get one pair of size L Big/tall accidentally and they came to the middle of my sons chest, reminder he is 6'1 about 160lbs lol get regular L, and if you are a female my size, get the men's small because I LOVE THEM.",5
B01H7HOS6U,"I bought a couple pair of these in men's small for my 14 year old sons.  They have a little room, but they both really like the fit.  They are both 5'7"" and weigh 115lbs. and 125 lbs.  They are a good, medium weight fabric.  They wear them almost daily to school.  The perfect jogger for middle school boys.",5
B01H7HOS6U,These are great pants but the ones that were sent to me were different from the ones in the picture. Mine was darker while the one in the picture was lighter.,4
B01H7HOS6U,"The sweats themselves are comfortable and warm.  That said, the pockets are so shallow they are basically non-functional for your standard phone, keys, or wallet.  It's not a total deal breaker for me, but it does mean I have to wear them with a jacket with good pockets if I want to leave the house.",4
B01H7HOS6U,"I've had these sweat pants for a while now and have put them through several washings.  Like most sweat pants that are not 100% cotton, they shed some of the fiber lining and have what looks like knots coming out on the outside.  I've found this on other brands of lesser quality as well.  These sweats are by no means a heavy weight sweat pants.  Several years back I had a set of Champion sweatpants gifted to me that were much heavier and didn't have the slight issues like these do.  Those weighed approximately twice what these do.  However, I've found these keep the wind from cutting through like lighter weight sweatpants while riding a bicycle.  If they last like the Champions sweats I had before, i'll purchase these again.",4
B01H7HOS6U,"Heavier weight than I expected, but good for lounging in winter.",4
B01H7HOS6U,Very soft and comfortable. I am 6 foot tall and 230 pounds and the extra large was a perfect fit.,5
B01H7HOS6U,"These are good. Best value I have found so far. If you get cheaper sweatpants, they are not  worth having.I wish that they had more cotton because I grew up with cotton clothes.  These are prtty good compaired to others. I wil order a few more.",5
B01H7HOS6U,"Everything about these are great except it lists XLT as a 36"" inseam but really its more like 40"".  Not the end of the world for sitting around the house or going to the gym but not ideal either.",4
B01H7HOS6U,Excellent looking and more comfortable than expected. Can be worn anytime.,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Fits nice and is comfortable, however there's a lot of fuzz on the interior that comes off and goes everywhere. Beware when you first wash these with other clothes, as it will spread black fuzz and lint on everything.",4
B01H7HOS6U,great fit,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Great quality. Runs big (both in width & length), order a size down.",5
B01H7HOS6U,Very comfortable but the draw strings are only about 2 inches long and have been lost into the item after just a few hours wearing them.,4
B01H7HOS6U,"They are worth every cent and more!  The quality of the material, ability to tie the drawstring, deep, strong pockets!  Excellent workout or lounge around pants!  Shipped quickly and better than expected. :)",5
B01H7HOS6U,I bought these for my 16 year old son and he loves them. The size runs true. The arrived quickly and the price was perfect.,5
B01H7HOS6U,My son loved these. Good quality. Washes well. Wears well. Could be a tad longer but overall great.,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Got these at a bargain price just before Xmas. I got them for myself. I am a women and I love these to wear around the house. Fabric is nice and thick, excellent quality. I have absolutely no complaints. I am completely happy with my purchase. I only wish I had purchased more at that price. I would definitely purchase again.",5
B01H7HOS6U,Very true to size. Comfortable and light weight.,5
B01H7HOS6U,"As a bigger guy its been hard for me to find sweatpants that fit good. These are it. Love the tapered bottom with large elastic. The waist band is also good quality elastic with a tie string. I wish they made more colors, i would get all of them.",5
B01H7HOS6U,"I love these joggers.  Yes, I'm a female but I love the way these fit.  They are the perfect weight and I think because they are mens you get just a little bit of a longer leg length which I like.  I had already ordered the navy so I had to go back and get more colors.  Plus I got them as a xmas gift for my stepson.  I like a bit of a looser fit so I went up a size to a medium.  Champion is such good quality, you have to give these a try!",5
B01H7HOS6U,Comfortable,5
B01H7HOS6U,Best sweat pants by far,5
B01H7HOS6U,The fabric inside is so soft! Delivery was fast!It looks like blue when i ordered black but other than that good quality,4
B01H7HOS6U,Very good material and size,5
B01H7HOS6U,I purchased size medium it fits perfectly. I'm 6 ft & 182 lbs,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Believe it or not, as a person that buys Nike and Champion joggers and hoodies, I actually prefer the fit of Champion. Soft, comfortable and perfect for fall/winter due to the fleece lining. These are highly recommended!",5
B01H7HOS6U,Love everything about the pants except the pockets. Very shallow! Front wallet falls out when sitting! No way phone will stay in!,4
B01H7HOS6U,"Great quality, fit and quickly shipped!",5
B01H7HOS6U,"it's getting a little chilly in my area, so these joggers will keep me warm and comfortable, and the price was great!!",5
B01H7HOS6U,"Good price, and happy with purchase.",4
B01H7HOS6U,My son is a football player and has thicker thighs. These pants fit great. They are definitely worth the price.,5
B01H7HOS6U,Perfect fit last a long time well made fair price,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Only complaint is that sometimes cotton from the inside sheds out, but it's a nonissue.",5
B01H7HOS6U,"Champion products fit well and do not lose their elasticity or fall off my body. They are double stitched and use heavier fabric of a higher quality. The dye lot matches my Champion zippered sweatshirt. I am very pleased with my purchase, which was a good Black Friday value.",5
B01H7HOS6U,Great price and good quality,5
B01H7HOS6U,comfortable to wear and quality crafted from relaxing in the house or working out in the gym these do the job,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Nice and fit good, but after two years starting to fade",5
B01H7HOS6U,These seem comfortable and have good material.,5
B01H7HOS6U,Buena calidad,5
B01H7HOS6U,"These are some of the softest work out pants I own! I didn't want to take them off at the end of the day honestly. Look and feel great, even great at deflecting wind which I didn't expect",5
B01H7HOS6U,My grandson loves these! Sizing great!,5
B01H7HOS6U,Love these joggers. Soft. Warm. Comfy. What else can you ask for!,5
B01H7HOS6U,Great product and delivery,5
B01H7HOS6U,Everything was alright,5
B01H7HOS6U,"They sent me two different champion sweatpants, even though I asked for the exact same ones in two different sizes on top of that one was one color gray, and the other was another type of gray other than that they are decent.",3
B01H7HOS6U,"Looks great and has held up color for the past 2 years but they do Run a little small, so size up. Very comfy and warm.",5
B01H7HOS6U,Husband LOVES these.,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Great, but needs deeper pockets so wallet doesnt fall out and long loose cuff slides down over heel (so maybe 2 lengths for men would be nice) Please update major pocket issue!!!!",3
B01H7HOS6U,These are comfortable and fit well.,5
B01H7HOS6U,I bought the M grey version in 2021 which was perfect length for 6' and had deep pockets. I was disappointed to find that the latest one has shallow pockets. The pocket opening is same length as the opening. How do you expect anything to stay in your pocket when you are shuffling around. See picture.,3
B01H7HOS6U,These were a real good fit good quality,5
B01H7HOS6U,Fit well. Comfy,5
B01H7HOS6U,"I was surprised that after just 25 days, the stitching on the waist band of these popular joggers started to become frayed and undone. Kinda frustrating because I chose champion expecting to have the quality be... well... champion level quality. I am disappointed to say that these were not good quality. The reason I give it 3 stars is because man, they are soft. I wouldn't recommend these to anybody sadly...",3
B01H7HOS6U,"Your phone will fall out of your pants during the gym over and over. Would be 5/5 if they had zipper pockets or even just deeper pockets to fit a smart phone. This aint 1990, update your pants.",3
B01H7HOS6U,Wore it outside on 20 degree weather and kept me pretty warm! Fits well and super comfortable. Planning on maybe getting different colors now at some point.,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Darn. They look pretty good and seem quality but they are not the correct proportions. When you sit, they go half way down your backside. If you bend over, they're practically off.",3
B01H7HOS6U,Not the nicest in the world. Wouldn't want to pay full price but when on sale it's a decent deal! Hoping they do not shrink on me!,4
B01H7HOS6U,"My husband will love these they are soft and warm, well made",5
B01H7HOS6U,"Nice sweatpants, good thickness, very soft with a tapered look. The only thing I wish it had were tighter cuffs, they are a little loose.",4
B01H7HOS6U,"I've had some old Champion brand shirts that have lasted decades.  I ordered these sweat pants based on the assumption that they would be my replacement for old stretched out sweat pants from Sams Club.  I just put these on and they fit just perfectly and are a great match for my new Champion T-Shirts.  Now that I've satisfied my self regarding the fit and the finish of this  outfit, I'm going to place and order for more.  Really like these.",5
B01H7HOS6U,good quality perfect size,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Husband is 6'3 265 lbs. I ordered his usual 3XLT. The legs are super wide, the cuff at the bottom very loose. Pockets are deep enough that cell phone will not fall out. Champion is quality made, medium weight. I'll size down to a 2XLT next time but still keeping this pair.",5
B01H7HOS6U,They fit great.,5
B01H7HOS6U,They're comfortable.,4
B01H7HOS6U,Interestingly these pill more on the outside than the inside. Other than that the inseam could be longer for over 6' tall people. They are acceptable.,4
B01H7HOS6U,He loves the fit,5
B01H7HOS6U,"Very warm but the pockets are not deep enough and my wallet, phone, and keys fall out when I sit down.",3
B0C2DSSX24,"As an active guy who works out regularly, I'm always on the hunt for comfortable, high-performing underwear that can keep up with my lifestyle. I decided to give these quick-dry underwear from Under Armour a shot and I'm happy to report they totally deliver. Here is my list of pro and cons:Pros:- Lightweight, stretchy fabric provides a super comfortable fit- Excellent moisture-wicking technology keeps me cool and dry- Anti-chafe design prevents rubbing and irritation- Seamless leg openings are smooth on skin- Contoured pouch provides decent support and keeps everything in place- Holds up well over time without losing stretch or drying abilityCons:- Pouch stitching can sometimes be a little uncomfortable on the skin- Not 100% chafe-proof during intense workoutsAfter a bunch of washes, these underwear have held up great. They still fit like new and haven't lost their stretch or quick-drying abilities. For the affordable price, these have become a staple in my workout wardrobe. For guys searching for high-performance, breathable underwear perfect for staying active, I highly recommend these from Under Armour. They check all my boxes - comfort, support, sweat-wicking, and durability with just some minor cons. I can go hard at the gym or out on a run knowing these underwear have got me covered, keeping me chafe-free and dry even when I work up a serious sweat. Hope this review helped!",5
B0C2DSSX24,Best quality and comfortable,5
B0C2DSSX24,I like the material and they are very soft and cool. Sizing seems a little small.,4
B0C2DSSX24,"I have been wearing Calvin Klein for a long time and decided to try a bunch of new underwear.  This pair was second best out of the ones I tried.  Great at wicking away moisture and pretty comfortable.  The only downside was they do occasionally ride up a bit.  Quick comparisons to the other brands are below.1. Lululemon Always in Motion Boxer 5 Inch - 5 Stars: Easily the most comfortable, but pretty pricey.  The only pair that doesn't ride when moving around.2. Under Armour Men's Tech 6-inch Boxerjock 2-Pack - 4.5 Stars: Not quite as comfortable as Lululemon, but still pretty comfortable and more affordable.  Great at absorbing moisture but ride up your leg a bit sometimes.3. Calvin Klein - 4-5 Stars: I actually have a ton of these and don't remember the exact ones.  Some of them fit decently well, and some not so much. On average they are pretty decent though4. ExOfficio Men's Give-n-go Boxer Brief - 3.5 Stars: These are... fine.  They are middle of the road in comfort and good at absorbing moisture.  But for the price there are just way better options.5. Pair of Thieves Super Fit Underwear for Men Pack - 2 & 3 Pack Boxer Briefs - AMZ Exclusive - 3.5 Stars: These are weird.  Super comfy when dry, but terrible moisture absorption.  When even slightly wet they are super uncomfortable.  Definitely don't plan to sweat in these.6. Pair of Thieves Cotton Boxer Briefs for Men Pack (4 Pack) - 4 Stars:  Not as comfortable as all of the non-cotton options, but a decent value.7. Smartwool Boxer Brief - 1 Star: Complete and utter garbage.  Overpriced, not very comfortable, not any better at wicking moisture away than all of the similar priced options.",5
B0C2DSSX24,My husband loved the look and the feel of these!,5
B0C2DSSX24,Great product with a great fit.  So glad they finally got rid of the sewn in labels,5
B0C2DSSX24,My son knows these kind of underwear,5
B0C2DSSX24,Great material and fit tts,5
B0C2DSSX24,They are stretchy and fit great. The material is very soft which makes for a comfy fit. The hole is tight enough so my boy doesn't fall through. It's almost like a Satin material. Highly recommend. It is 80% polyester. My waist is a 34. I grabbed the large and they fit loosely but not falling off.,5
B0C2DSSX24,Fits great,5
B0C2DSSX24,Nice fit and good quality!!,5
B0C2DSSX24,Perfect,5
B0C2DSSX24,"Very good product,love them and they fit well.",5
B0C2DSSX24,These boxers are the only ones I'll use as they are the only ones that keep me dry in the extremely high humidity environment I live in. Never had any chafing issues whatsoever.,5
B0C2DSSX24,"They're a little right but still very comfortable. The last set I bought lasted years so I had to order more. They ride just a little high, so if I'm my careful, my stomach can cause the band to roll.",5
B0C2DSSX24,as said,4
B0C2DSSX24,These fit smaller than the exact pairs I have directly from the website,3
B0C2DSSX24,Under Armour never disappoints,5
B0C2DSSX24,"Hubs has been a Jockey guy his whole life, but after a year or so, they stretch and get baggy.  I'm hoping these will stay stretchy and tight longer.  So far, so good.",5
B0C2DSSX24,Comfortable and nice looking,5
B0C2DSSX24,"Slowly restocking my underwear drawer and bought a pack of these even though they were expensive. Within the same week bought two more packs.  These are insanely soft, fit snugly, and they offer a good amount of support and keep everything ""in place"" without being uncomfortable. I'm never worried about the leg riding up or anything falling out when I don't want it to when I wear these. There is a pouch in front for extra room which I wasn't expecting, since it's hard to see in the pictures.These are the best underwear I've ever bought, if you like snug or close fitting underwear you'll love these.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"I love the UA Boxerjock tech underwear because they are comfortable and last for years. It is time to replace them, and I am happy to find them on Amazon.",5
B0C2DSSX24,Holds your package in placeNo binding or ride problemsSecureLight weightEasy to launder if you travelDries over night.,5
B0C2DSSX24,"great quality, last for years",5
B0C2DSSX24,"Like them ,bought them 3 times . Hold up the best",5
B0C2DSSX24,Fit great and are truly the best!,5
B0C2DSSX24,Muy buena.,5
B0C2DSSX24,"I am a walking billboard for Under Armour clothes so it's only fitting to wear the UA briefs too.  These fit perfectly for my size (medium 5' 10"" / 200lbs).After wearing them for a day at work I have no complaints except for a minor one.  I bought the 6"" inseam style and at the end of the day they did begin to ride up a bit.  Not enough to be uncomfortable but noticeable.  If I were to purchase again I would recommend the 9"" inseam style.Overall I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend.",4
B0C2DSSX24,Very interesting,5
B0C2DSSX24,I love UA underwear. They are excellent quality and do the job!,4
B0C2DSSX24,arrived on time.,5
B0C2DSSX24,"I'm 5'7 - 160 pounds. I'm very active, walk, run, hike 7-8 miles every single day. I want to like this underwear but the problem I have is that they ride up the leg. Specifically while sitting down.I'm going to try the 9inch boxerjocks to see if they have the same issue, otherwise I'm going to stick with my Adidas boxer brief's which never ride up the leg.The material is super soft and comfortable and I love how it feels against my skin. I can't give it a 5/5 if I have to take them off and switch back to my Adidas underwear.",3
B0C2DSSX24,Buy on sale. Get a deal. True UA brand.,4
B0C2DSSX24,"These are as described. If I had any complaints at all, it would just be the price, but everything costs a lot these days so. These are good quality.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"Great underwear, a bit pricey in my mind but the competition is about the same price, I would definitely buy more if I found them on sale",5
B0C2DSSX24,Only underwear I like wearing,5
B0C2DSSX24,"high quality performance boxers, very comfortable briefs, the vents in the crouch area for air flow are clutch.",5
B0C2DSSX24,Been wearing these boxer jocks for over 15 years (not this one particular pair eww).  They last a long time and are my standard for comfort.  I've tried others over the years but these still make the grade as the standard.,5
B0C2DSSX24,These fit and feel fine for size and texture. They are however uncomfortable in important areas south of the midriff. I sized up to xl.,4
B0C2DSSX24,"Vastly different in material and fit than previously purchased from the same manufacturer. To be fair, I did not compare the product code, so cannot fault the manufacturer for offering different styles and fits. If, I had been able to see this item before purchasing I would have sought something more like what I have purchased in the past from them. I feel this is a lessor quality item than I have experienced before. But, fault is on me for not making the effort to explore more options, if they exist, from this manufacturer. Lack of product knowledge is 100% on me.",3
B0C2DSSX24,"A little pricey, but a guess you have to pay a little bit more if you want the 'Under Armour' name.  They look sleek, fit & feel good. They look good when my jeans come off so I'm happy.",5
B0C2DSSX24,Feels like your standard spandex underwear. It fits a little tight so it's not super comfy. It works no better than your average spandex boxers. I bought it for $25. I wouldn't pay more than $35 for these 2 packs though. Not worth it being that much when it feels like a regular standard spandex boxers.,4
B0C2DSSX24,"Keeps you nice and cool and comfy. Wicks well. Actually, got these for summer sleeping instead of pajamas and they are fabulous.",5
B0C2DSSX24,husband wears only under armour boxerjocks.. always a good price and worth the money.,5
B0C2DSSX24,disappointed it overall comfort of these,3
B0C2DSSX24,"I like the support, mild compression, perfect fit, and the smooth texture of the fabric. The design is identifiably UA but not loud or brash.  These are my first choice to wear at the gym.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"I've tried different underwear brands and Under Armour is the best.  First, my underwear MUST have a working fly.  Second, my underwear MUST be of a wicking material that doesn't retain your sweat and cause crotch chaffing.  Third, the size must fit me nicely without looseness or binding.  I always order size XL.  I've recently gone from a size 38 waist down to a size 36 waist and this underwear fits me well at both waist sizes.  Fourth,  I like the different lengths.  When I wear long pants, I wear 9"" length underwear.  When I wear shorts, I wear 6"" length underwear.  Under Armour underwear fits the bill for all my needs.",5
B0C2DSSX24,Was what was ordered.,5
B0C2DSSX24,Well worth the money,5
B0C2DSSX24,"Fit and quality was what I expected from UA. I have worn this multiple times, machine washed them and air dried them. No issues.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"Bought these for travel because they dry so much faster than ""tightly whiteys.""",5
B0C2DSSX24,Nice snug fit with no chafing,5
B0C2DSSX24,The briefs look great and fit perfectly.  One of the best I have purchased. Only problem was with the seller. The 3 pack was sent in the manufacturer packaging  exposing the briefs. No box to protect from the elements  and letting all handlers from seeing the items. This was a first item from Amazon not put in a box or envelope.,5
B0C2DSSX24,It took me years to find underwear that fit me properly. It was worth the extra money and trouble to ship it to Europe.,5
B0C2DSSX24,Destroys anything and everything you used to think about underwear!,5
B0C2DSSX24,"I love these, they look great, feel great, waist-band stays in place pretty well and jock pouch keeps everything comfortably where it should be.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"Kinda of pricey, but worth it and last a long time. Been wearing under armour underwear for the last 15 years",5
B0C2DSSX24,Good fit good quality an A+,5
B0C2DSSX24,Will buy again. Quality and fit are good. Im 235# and the XL fit perfect.,5

B0C2DSSX24,"Excelente compra, muy buena calidad, buen ajuste talla perfecto.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"FLAWLESS!!!  Need i say more.  These are the best underwear money can buy hands down.  This is all i wear now.  The fit, comfort, stretch, durability, etc. all second to none.  Buy one pack, and I guarantee you will throw all your other underwear away and buy these.  Click ""BUY NOW"" right now!",5
B0C2DSSX24,"Very light, like them much more than expected.  Ordering more.",5
B0C2DSSX24,"I was reluctant to purchase these due to the price. However, UA clothes hold up well so I decided to give them a try. My husband is very active coaching and refereeing. He needed something that would allow him to be active without chaffing. He loves these and we will be buying more. They are the perfect length and fit. I highly recommend spending the money and buying these underwear.",5
B0C2DSSX24,Good quality and fits perfect.,5
B0C2DSSX24,"I really like these underwear.  Comfortable, keeps you cool during workouts and sports.  Supportive.  Wicks sweat away like a champ which for me was most important.Only issue is that the inside of the underwear has some rough stitching which, which can be a little uncomfortable to the important parts.  Not too bad, but enough that I am not going to give this a perfect 5 stars.",4
B0C2DSSX24,The product was fine.  What was disgraceful was the packaging.  The box the product  cane in was significantly damaged up taped to hold it together.  The product was just stuffed into the box.  Course it was returned.,3
B0C2DSSX24,"Fits true to size and a good, comfortable material",4
B0C2DSSX24,Bought these for my son.  He says they are very comfortable,5
B0C2DSSX24,They look good,5
B0C2DSSX24,Self,4
B0C2DSSX24,Great quality and reasonably priced.,4
B0C2DSSX24,Very good quality,5
B0C2DSSX24,"There were a lot of underwear from other brands, these are incomparable for their price! very pleasant to the body, light, breathable and very comfortable.",5
B0C2DSSX24,I like these boxers but only two were in the box i received.,3
B07VPLC6CL,"For reference I wear a men size 11 for New Balance and the ruler in the photos are in inches and centimetersFor my foot size, it is basically a perfect fit. It isn't loose or tight and I have some room to spread my toes. I could see it being a good fit even if I was a size 12 as there is still some significant room to stretch. It is able to stretch a lot and the bottom of the sock has like a terry weave texture. It ends right at my ankle bone.",5
B07VPLC6CL,These are my husbands go to socks for size and comfort. They have always been a qood quality brand. They do stretch out over time and loose that original snug fit.,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Please use caution when detaching these socks from their packaging. I was an absolute goofball when I did so and I simply just pulled and popped the plastic string thingies that are used on the gazillion products and we've all encountered before. They are not super strong and they do pop apart with just a little tug, but in the case of a couple of them - they simply pulled through the sock. There are quite a few of these riddled throughout the packaging so my advice would be to simply use a pair of scissors or nail clippers and keep track of them instead of just ripping them apart. I now have at least one that has a quarter inch size hole in it because of failing to do so.I left the five-star feedback because these are absolutely perfect socks physically. They stay positioned where you put them and they don't creep down your heel inside of your shoes - or at least mine anyway. They are absolutely the most comfortable socks I have ever worn because they give your foot a solid wrap and the fabric itself is very smooth and silky but yet feels very very durable.Overall - 101% recommended. Again, just take caution when disassembling the packaging. I still can't believe that I did that, lol.",5
B07VPLC6CL,I love wearing black socks over any other color. Maybe it's just me but I think they last longer and even feel more comfortable. These are a little lower cut than I wanted but it's not an issue.,5
B07VPLC6CL,"High quality! Thicker and cushier but not hot/sweaty. I expected them to be cheap because of the low price, but they are good to go.",5
B07VPLC6CL,"Nice and thick sox, nice it comes with 12 and fairly priced",5
B07VPLC6CL,"These Fruit of the Loom Dual Defense Low Cut Socks are exactly what i was looking for. They are just the right thickness - comfortable yet breathable, perfect for daily wear. The length is ideal, and they stay in place without slipping. What really stands out is their durability; I've had issues with socks wearing out on the bottom in the past, but these seem built to last. The 12-pack offers fantastic value for the price, making it an excellent deal for anyone in need of quality socks that can withstand regular use.",5
B07VPLC6CL,"I used to believe a sock had to come up to the calf, but after my first set of ankle socks, I bought these for dad. Guess he was a little too set in his ways to change from the almost hosiery socks to ankles",5
B07VPLC6CL,Very comfortable. Super nice,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Great price, good socks",5
B07VPLC6CL,Great buy,5
B07VPLC6CL,No complaints lol,5
B07VPLC6CL,Just wow. I bought these for my feet and they fit perfectly over the entire body part. And they send you multiple pairs so if one gets dirty you can throw it away and attach a new one! If you have feet then I recommend buying these!,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Ive been buying these same socks for awhile now and honestly, they just get the job done.",4
B07VPLC6CL,"I like these socks, but seem a little thinner than previous brands that I have purchased. But seem to wear fairly well.",4
B07VPLC6CL,They shipped in no time was here the day after I ordered them. The fit was perfect the color being white was just what I wanted. The  comfort is excellent and the quality is very durable.,5
B07VPLC6CL,It was a great deal and delivered fast too very comfortable and they don't make my feet sweat,5
B07VPLC6CL,I've always had good luck with Fruit of the Loom products,5
B07VPLC6CL,Fit nicely. Great lightweight socks for summertime,5
B07VPLC6CL,I love these fruit of The loom You're amazing I love them I just bought three or four packages of ankle size ankle cut did white and black and you can't go once you go block you can't go back hahaha no but these socks are amazing and once you wash them they don't shrink they don't slide feet out of your shoes like they legit so through the loom is really stepping their game up,4
B07VPLC6CL,Nothing amazing about these but they are good for every day use. If your looking for sports these will be okay but you would probably need something thicker and more absorbent. These are for every day casual use. Nothing more nothing less,5
B07VPLC6CL,Good fit and quality,5
B07VPLC6CL,Fit great,5
B07VPLC6CL,If you have a size 9 foot or smaller these are going to be a little bit big.For the price they are decent socks. They make my feet sweat more than most socks.,4
B07VPLC6CL,Soft comfortable breathableFits well I like the material,4
B07VPLC6CL,"Socks. We need them like we need shoes. That being said, their mostly polyester socks are comfortable, I expect durable, but a little big as they run from sizes 6-12. Being a size 10.5, they are a little loose but not so much that they bunch, rub, or cause distraction.The cut is accurate, the material is thickish, and they seem to wick moisture well. Worth the price.",4
B07VPLC6CL,"Comfortable, but run big.",3
B07VPLC6CL,Arrived on time and as described,5
B07VPLC6CL,Good fit good quality,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Very comfy, durable and a great price",5
B07VPLC6CL,"thick and comfortable, perfect for everyday wear.",5
B07VPLC6CL,Good price and good quality.,5
B07VPLC6CL,They're tight and seem thin but I am a girl and have to wear men's shoes from sizes 10-11's and they were a cheap pack for 12 of them. I'm not crazy for anything special but they get the job done at a good price.,4
B07VPLC6CL,They are made from very thin material and the size is not exactly as good as these are larger than the size ordered.,3
B07VPLC6CL,These are very good and durable and they fit perfectly,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Comfortable warm, and just right thickness.  Breathable.  Fit just right.",5
B07VPLC6CL,Just putting it on you can tell the quality of these socks. Low cut but not too low. Great buy.,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Perfect fit, great socks, have purchased several times.",5
B07VPLC6CL,"I remember a time when Fruit of the Loom was of excellent quality and very long lasting. That is no longer the case. However, the price is relative to other brands, if not cheaper. I get about a year's use out of 12 pair. I guess that is fair.",4
B07VPLC6CL,"I didn't realize that they werent a cotton blend, but they seem to wash n wear well.",3
B07VPLC6CL,"They fit well, (I wear a size 12) and stay above my sketchers walking shoes, and golf shoes. I'm not sure how long they'll last but for some decent ankle socks they are comfortable and breathable.",5
B07VPLC6CL,Like some other reviews I find these too tight around the ankle.  They nice and thick and soft otherwise.,3
B07VPLC6CL,Nice fit and comfortable. Have held up better than more expensive ankle socks on here and haven't been rough on my feet working long hours.,5
B07VPLC6CL,Good,5
B07VPLC6CL,Always great to have new socks and they're comfortable!,5
B07VPLC6CL,I have size 11 feet. These are not big enough. Probably great for under size 10.,4
B07VPLC6CL,Buy a pack monthly. Great price and quality.,5
B07VPLC6CL,Good Socks,5
B07VPLC6CL,Este producto es de buena calidad y por eso lo recomiendo a todos.,4
B07VPLC6CL,Es para mi,5
B07VPLC6CL,These socks are comfortable all around. The elastic is good in the ankle area. Socks stay in place without any slipping. Great quality. They wash easy and have kept their color. Feet don't sweat in them either. A+ socks!,5
B07VPLC6CL,I would definitely buy them again.,5
B07VPLC6CL,S/A,4
B07VPLC6CL,Very nice socks! Fit their purpose perfectly! Highly recommend!,5
B07VPLC6CL,Nice feel!  Fits perfect super next day delivery!!!!,5
B07VPLC6CL,Just like described,5
B07VPLC6CL,Socks are great they are a gift for my brother the shoes I ordered never showed please help like you said you would,5
B07VPLC6CL,Great socks at a great price.  Purchased a set and liked them so much ordered another set.  The socks are thick with nice padding and very soft. Fit great (size 11 foot) and rise to the middle of ankle and pefrect for me.,5
B07VPLC6CL,Perfect fit for the price.,5
B07VPLC6CL,Only complaints I have are they don't fit real snug like all other socks the same size do..,3
B07VPLC6CL,"Shrink after one wash,",3
B07VPLC6CL,"I purchased these short socks for my husband.  Comfortable and easy to put on.  But the main reason I made the purchase was so it made it easy on me on wash day.  No more matching socks, they are all alike, easy to fold pairs and put away.",4
B07VPLC6CL,The quality and good price,5
B07VPLC6CL,"The socks came quick, fit great, and are comfortable.  They are also holding up great!",5
B07VPLC6CL,Thick and comfy,5
B07VPLC6CL,Fit well,5
B07VPLC6CL,Buen material y talla,5
B07VPLC6CL,Very comfortable,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Comfy, fit great, well priced.",5
B07VPLC6CL,My kid loved these soft and kept his feet cool. And a great price.,5
B07VPLC6CL,They feel great,5
B07VPLC6CL,Absolute steal of a deal!,5
B07VPLC6CL,Excellent,5
B07VPLC6CL,Nice comfy fit and they hold up well,5
B07VPLC6CL,I am very happy with the product and quality.  I have ordered again I have placed a few orders now for the same brand of product.,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Very comfy, lots of toe room, stay on heel. Glad I got 12pr",5
B07VPLC6CL,These socks are made to be durable with quality material.  They also give some great cushion to the sole when on my feet for long periods of time.,5
B07VPLC6CL,"They are too short, below the ankle expected to the ankle.",3
B07VPLC6CL,"Bought these for my husband for work! He does pressure washing for a living, so his feet stay soaked. They are very comfortable and durable. Quality holds up well after washing. Great purchase.",5
B07VPLC6CL,"I ordered the ""Medium 6-12"" size. I'm a size 9. The grey heel part sits on the back of my foot instead of the heel when I pull these socks snug. No one wants that. One size down might have worked but it's too late now. Imagine if I was a size 6, these socks would be comically large. Fix your sizing Fruit of the Loom!",3
B07VPLC6CL,My shoe size is 9. Socks are too big! Not breathable. My good for cold area with bigger foot size. I am in Texas.,2
B07VPLC6CL,"The socks are fine.  However, they are fixed to the package with many small, sharp plastic stays that must be snipped out individually. Thought I removed them all, but so far I have been poked in the foot twice by ones I missed still hidden in the new sock. It makes me wonder if the bigwigs at FOTL ever actually buy and unpackage their own product.  -Also, the plastic stays probably end up in the ocean and poke fish in the eyes!",3
B07VPLC6CL,Should have thrown away the old socks and bought these weeks ago,5
B07VPLC6CL,I like my feet covered in the winter and from the ar condition in the summer. The 12 pair are  comfortable to wear. I would only buy this brand again.,5
B07VPLC6CL,"Comfortable, soft, and elastic like a sock should be.",5
B07VPLC6CL,"I wanted to try these no show socks, since my ankle socks have now stretched to ABOVE ANKLE socks, lol, but whoa, these are really short, so now I need to stretch these so they are just above the ankle bone.  No happy middle ground.  lol",5
B07VPLC6CL,"I found these socks to be a bit small. I wear a 12.5 to 13 shoe, and the socks I ordered were said to fit up to a size 13. Well, in my opinion, they don't. They fit with the tightness of a latex glove and aren't comfortable as a result, if you are at the top end of the fit range.That said, my son wears an 11 so I gave them to him. He finds them to be very comfortable and they are holding up well. Had I ordered a larger size, I would have had no complaints about these socks whatsoever, and they are so affordable compared to other brands that I plan to re-order and get the next larger size.I would recommend them, just be aware that I feel they are a bit smaller than expected, and buy accordingly.",4
B07VPLC6CL,"Great elasticity and sizing. They are totally great men socks, not too heavy, not too warm either, perfect for south Carolina.",5
B07VPLC6CL,Can't complain. They are snug and my feet can breathe.,5
B07VPLC6CL,Not as thick as some sport socks but comfortable amd wear well.,5
B08LP1BXNF,Warm and fitted but not compression this top works great under sweaters and shirts in cold weather.  Good price and quick shipping!,5
B08LP1BXNF,These shirts are great. Very comfortable fit and keep you warm on winter as a layer under both athletic clothes or under a sweater. They are great - plan to get them in other colors.,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Very breathable, and not suffocating tight. Great fit and very comfortable.",5
B08LP1BXNF,Perfect and keeps me warm!,5
B08LP1BXNF,"When this arrived, I didn't understand why this fit so much looser than the one I've had for several years.Then I did a little research, and realized there are more than one type of UA Cold Gear in turtleneck.My old one is a Compression style, hence the tightness, while this is a Fitted one.So, if you want a little looser, this is the one, but if tight, order the Compression, which Amazon also has available.The tightness of the Compression is not for some, but I like it, because it's warmer, closer to the skin, and unobtrusive under shirts and sweaters, having no excess fabric, i.e. folds, ripples or bulges.The worst part of this one is that the neck is loose, and nothing looks goofier than a saggy, flacid turtleneck, IMO.The Compression model fits tightly to the neck, and looks very sharp.I will be ordering the Compression soon, and just give this one away, probably, as I already washed it, before realizing.",4
B08LP1BXNF,"I rarely write reviews but this under armor has a tight neck (what I wanted) the videos show a loose neck but I took a chance , warm also which is what I needed  (I work in oilfields) well done , thanks",5
B08LP1BXNF,Did exactly what I needed. Good fit and definitely help wick sweat during hikes in the winter,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Use this for early season baseball.  Warm and still allows for full range of motion.  Only gave four stars because the outside of the shirt pills really bad after a couple of washes.  Doesn't matter if you wear it as a base layer, but would be noticeable if you wore it alone.",4
B08LP1BXNF,Awesome quality product and a great price.,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Good, warm",5
B08LP1BXNF,Fit great. Wash great,5
B08LP1BXNF,Husband loves for work and gym.,5
B08LP1BXNF,"I just got it. After a wash, I am already using it and loving it. It's soft and warm.I am usually an XL, but I got the XXL as all my clothes shrink slightly.I got the regular neck version before, and the quality feels the same.I do not give 5 stars to any product, just so you know.",4
B08LP1BXNF,Bought it as a gift and he loved them.,5
B08LP1BXNF,UA cold gear is the best,5
B08LP1BXNF,"I bought it big because I knew it was supposed to be tight, but...it's still tight. I'm also not the fittest person in the world so I'm glad I got a size bigger.It'll keep you warm and that's good enough.",4
B08LP1BXNF,My husband said it's very warm,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Great shirt, good price, good quality",5
B08LP1BXNF,"I love this coldgear wear.  This alone will keep you warm when jogging in subzero temperatures.  I have another one of these Underarmor coldgear that I bought many years ago (maybe 15 years ago) that had a dual color design.  I wish the newer ones also had a dual color option, but I did not fnd any.  The old one I have is still going strong with nary a blemish.",5
B08LP1BXNF,Great top to wear in cold weather to stay warm.,5
B08LP1BXNF,Great compression top to stay warm in cold weather.  True to size.,5
B08LP1BXNF,Keeps you warm during hikes in cool weather.,5
B08LP1BXNF,Great fit and quality.,5
B08LP1BXNF,very much midweight with a snug but not compression fit. Works well under a heavier layer.Usual UA quality.,5
B08LP1BXNF,Comfortable,5
B08LP1BXNF,I wore this while snowboarding in Colorado. It was 19 degrees and snowing all day and this layer kept me comfortable all day.,5
B08LP1BXNF,Very nice I like it,5
B08LP1BXNF,I'm 5'9 and 170 lbs. Got a medium and it fits great.,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Decent quality, decent warmth.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Runs a little large I'm 5' 10"" 178 and jacked.  Going to try the medium.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"It feels great and works well, Would recommend.",5
B08LP1BXNF,Item is good. It does run big. Im usually a XL in shirts and I had to order a medium.,4
B08LP1BXNF,"This shirt is perfect. Fits well, actually keeps you warm. Will definitely be buying more",5
B08LP1BXNF,All is as promised,5
B08LP1BXNF,I have a hard time finding long enough shirts. I ordered this as a 2XL for the length and it fits perfect.,5
B08LP1BXNF,"It's nice quality and a nice fit but quite long so you can't wear it out, I'm 6 ft 11 and 170 lb. Also, is it necessary to put a big white logo on my neck? My wife commented that I looked a bit like a priest. I took a Sharpie magic marker and colored the logo to tone it down. It's a nice shirt otherwise for athletics, I use it for motorcycle rides.",3
B08LP1BXNF,"Great texture on the inside, works awesome as a cold weather base layer or shirt for medium cold days.",5
B08LP1BXNF,This shirt is not bad. But if you've had one of these under armor shirts from years ago? Then you know they were much better made back then. I still have 3 of these from like 2008. And they still fit pretty good but wear and tear promoted me to order more. This shirt is not the same material. I suggest you guys go back to the way these were made years ago.,3
B08LP1BXNF,The color is good but much thinner than I expected.  Last time purchasing.,4
B08LP1BXNF,"The product is fine, as expected. It was delivered to the wrong address.",4
B08LP1BXNF,"Great quality, warm , comfortable, UA product",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Super fast shipping and great warmth, thickness and quality as well as fit",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Bought the OD to match my uniform. Wish they made it in Coyote. Looks like they aren't making it anymore, moving away from LEO and military customers. I guess they market more to the flashy and foofoo clientele and not public service providers.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"As above, these are great. Realize the fit is somewhat tight unlike traditional long underwear. Good looking shirt with just right thickness of fabric.12-11-24 revision: shirt pills, I now rate it a 3.",3
B08LP1BXNF,Works great for any sports,5
B08LP1BXNF,I always wore medium under armour cold gear but the medium was HUGE - so I exchanged it for a small (hassle free) which fits perfectly.Thanks for the quick exchange,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Generally, fits. Soft with elastic materials. Typically fits to the body",5
B08LP1BXNF,great for winter,5
B08LP1BXNF,"el mock lo adquiri para mi talla que soy L resulta que si me da, mi unica molestia es que es muy grande, queria algo que llegara a mi cintura o un poco mas, esto se va hasta mis gluteos mido 1.68 cm, pero supongo que es pensado para gente de mas alta.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Husband loves UA Mocks. Fitted, not compression is what works for his 5'11 height and 200 lb muscular frame. ( Bought XL)He likes the warmth they provide on cold NJ winter days, but he also likes the look under a nice flannel or 1/4 zip shirt.He wears daily under collared LS work shirts in the winter as some work locations are cold.This shirt in particular is exact same shirt that is currently being sold at Dick's Sporting Goods. I physically compared in person. No difference EXCEPT Dick's is $20.00 more costly.Ps, we also wear these as added warmth on motorcycle when chilly. So versatile. Highly recommend.",5
B08LP1BXNF,good seller. good product,5
B08LP1BXNF,Amazing product true fit and great quality,5
B08LP1BXNF,"An absolute must-have for cold weather.  This shirt is perfect for the onset of cold weather.  Wear it as a top or as a liner under your normal shirt or turtleneck for extra warmth on cold and windy days.  I first tested this shirt on the coldest and windiest day of the year.  It kept me comfortable in the face of a damp, cold breeze and was a big improvement over just wearing a jacket or coat.Likes:ComfortWarmthQualityFitColorDislikes:NoneRecommended to purchase!!",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Read some reviews for this item that sound like they  they were posted for the wrong product.  This is actual, brand new with tags, in an unopened package Under Armour.  As described by Amazon.  Received in two days as promised.  Not used, not dirty, not stained.  It's perfect and what I expect from Under Armour.  Will buy again.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Fit was spot on for me. Warm, quality is great, thick enough for winter warmth, great price and comfortable for me to wear as a layer",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Purchased to use under my jersey for those cold evening playing softball!  Glad I have it, it works, and I manage to stay fairly warm.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"I ordered this one because the regular compression shirt made me feel as if I was suffocating and It was so tight on my skin that I had trouble getting it off without ripping it.This fitted version is more loose, but still fits well under a jersey, is much warmer, and you can wear it on its own.Only downside is the sleeve cuffs being a bit loose, b they cover up the wrists on my batting gloves. Not a huge deal though.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"Looks great. Really handles the chill.  Very versatile, useful alone or layered or with a jacket.  Around the house instead of a sweatshirt.",5
B08LP1BXNF,I bought this for someone who works in the cold. They say it helps keep them warm and fits and feels comfortable.,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Great mock golf tee, very warm!",5
B08LP1BXNF,"This is the second Under Armor ""cold climate"" fitted shirt I've purchased. It wears well; doesn't bind or interfere with exercise and washes well. Great purchase at a good price. No complaints  at all.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"This shirt is exactly what I wanted, and I probably will buy more",5
B08LP1BXNF,Very good cold weax upper. Recommended,4
B08LP1BXNF,"Stylish, great fit and accessory to keep you warm. Bought 2 liked them so much bought 2 more",5
B08LP1BXNF,Keeps warm and fits great. Great price,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Great for a base layer, occupation requires outdoor working and this helps to keep warm, it is lightweight, not bulky.",5
B08LP1BXNF,Very comfortable and warm.,5
B08LP1BXNF,100% Recommended,5
B08LP1BXNF,"I have been a fan of UA for a long time, products do exactly what they are supposed to do.  Always wish they were a little cheaper but thats not the world we live in.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"I have several that I tend to wear any day I intend to remain out, in VT this December.My only concern is the neck opening diameter, the mock, it's tight.",5
B08LP1BXNF,Amazing quality comfortable and looks great after wash and dry,5
B08LP1BXNF,I bought these for my son who works in the city outside. I asked them if the shirts were warm and he said yes. He loves them,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Good quality, but pricey for me. Fit well, nice, snug neck, but doesn't choke. It has good length which is getting hard to find.",5
B08LP1BXNF,It keeps me nice and warm for those 30 degree F days,5
B08LP1BXNF,"Although the neck can get itchy after a couple hours and it's a bit pricey, it's overall a great material and keeps you warm. very stylish and great for the gym or work.",5
B08LP1BXNF,"You can't beat Under Armour for base layer clothing.  My husband loves it and has occasion to wear it in the winter.  We used to live in a colder climate and he wore one all the time.  We live in a warmer climate, but sometimes it still comes in handy on cold days.",5
B08LP1BXNF,Great shirts and they last a long time,5
B08LP1BXNF,Body Hugging fit. Under Armour Fit under any pants/jeans ect.,5
B08MBFGL13,"These are one of the only socks I have that I can say works pretty good for me. They are very comfortable, they go pretty high on my legs and don't squeeze my legs like other socks do. These don't leave grooves on my legs because of excessive squeezing and don't run down after hours of use. They don't seem to have bad smell after all day wearing them. I recently purchased another batch of the same socks but different colors just because I found these work very well for me. I'm am not a fat or obese guy but I am not skinny either(5'11"", 200lbs moderately build); my legs are not thin and these socks fit perfectly. They are very well made overall(colors, length, materials, antibacterial material, etc.) Great socks. I hope they don't start rising the prices to the roof like every other product in the market. That would take a toll on my reviews for sure.",5
B08MBFGL13,They do fit tight around the lower leg.,5
B08MBFGL13,Always good quality and they are a big man's size which makes them much more comfortable because they fit correctly.,4
B08MBFGL13,"Excellent price for great socks.  The socks stretch easily, are the right thickness for me, and are very soft and comfortable.  I got a pack of 12 pairs and was very glad I had.",5
B08MBFGL13,These socks fit really well. They are not tight around my toes so they are very comfortable. Would purchase again!,5
B08MBFGL13,"The fit of these socks was ok,  I'm a men's size 11 shoe size and my ankles and calves are more on the thin side.  However, the elastic aspect of these socks makes the socks very tight around the calves and ankles to the point of discomfort. The cushioning is not that thick and is mainly around the bottom and around the foot. The rest of the sock is quite thin.  I'm not keeping these socks.When I ordered these socks I also ordered the Hanes Mens Double Tough Socks, 12-pair Pack Crew Socks, White/Grey Foot Bottom, 6-12 and the EnerWear 10P Pack Men's Cotton Moisture Wicking Heavy Cushion Crew Socks (10-13/shoe size 6-12 (10 Pair), White.  By comparison:The Hanes Mens Double Tough Socks don't have as much cushioning as the Hanes Men's Max Cushioned or the EnerWear socks. But the Double Tough socks don't have the extremely tight elastic of the Hanes Max Cushioned.  The cushioning is mainly around the foot with the part of the sock that covers the calf being quite thin.  I'm keeping these socks as there are times when a bit thinner sock is needed.  Time will tell as to how they hold up.  The sizing for me was good for this sock.The EnerWear socks have the most cushioning throughout the sock (compared to the other two socks), not just the bottom or directly around the foot.  The elastic is snug without being too tight. Of the three the EnerWear socks were the most comfortable and cushy feeling. These are also probably the longest socks, covering more of the calf than the other two socks.  The top of the EnerWear socks have a blue line at the top of the sock on the inside, that when rolled over and down the leg is then visible.  The sizing of these socks was also good for me.  I'm keeping the EnerWear socks when a thicker cotton sock is needed.",3
B08MBFGL13,"The Hanes Men's Max Cushioned Crew Socks are a solid, no-nonsense solution for those seeking comfortable, practical everyday footwear protection. These socks truly shine in their commitment to basic comfort and functionality, offering impressive moisture-wicking capabilities that keep feet dry during extended wear. The max cushioning is notably soft and provides exceptional comfort, especially for individuals who spend long hours on their feet or engage in activities that require additional foot support.The odor control technology is a standout feature, effectively preventing the unpleasant buildup of foot odor that can plague lesser quality socks. Even after multiple wears and washes, these socks maintain their shape and cushioning, demonstrating remarkable durability. The multipack option makes them an economical choice, ensuring you always have fresh, comfortable socks on hand without breaking the bank.While they might not be the most glamorous or fashionable socks on the market, Hanes has clearly prioritized performance and comfort. The crew length provides excellent coverage and stays up well, preventing uncomfortable sliding or bunching during movement. For anyone seeking reliable, well-constructed socks that deliver consistent comfort and performance, the Hanes Max Cushioned Crew Socks are an excellent, dependable choice that won't disappoint.",4
B08MBFGL13,"Dynamite! A friend of mine who works hard labor was tired of his feet being in wet cotton socks all day. We looked local stores and the only moisture-wicking socks made of similar materials was $20 for ONE PAIR! Came home, ordered these, and he loves them so much he had me order 8 more packages immediately.",5
B08MBFGL13,I like the way they feel as you walk I put them on with my new slippers and I am on my way comfortable and warm feet,5
B08MBFGL13,I ORDER THE WRONG ONES WANTED THE SHORTER CREW SOCK,4
B08MBFGL13,"These were a good deal. Unfortunately, the entire package was too big to stuff in my husband's go-bah and I could only grab two pairs during the five minutes we had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire. The fire burned the rest, a long with our home.",5
B08MBFGL13,Best socks I've owned in a long time. Very comfortable!,4
B08MBFGL13,"Great quality, durable material. This was an excellent purchase.",5
B08MBFGL13,Good quality socks fit well.. will be buying more,5
B08MBFGL13,My husband really likes this brand and style they sale. It is currently the only type he wears.,5
B08MBFGL13,At the exact spots needed very high quality,5
B08MBFGL13,I like the over the calf fit.,5

B08MBFGL13,Perfect fit. Comfortable. Good Haines quality.,5
B08MBFGL13,Needed more  Crew socks,5
B08MBFGL13,Fast delivery and great quality!!,5
B08MBFGL13,Outstanding quality and comfort.,5

B08MBFGL13,Good,5
B08MBFGL13,Okay,5
B08MBFGL13,Soft and comfy socks.  Hubs loves them,5
B08MBFGL13,"I wear a size 13 American shoe, so I got these socks in 12-14, I have to stretch them into my foot.They are nice and comfortable though, they feel thicker than my previous socks so hopefully they will last longer. So if you don't like to stretch your socks over your feet find these ones in a size bigger than your shoe size, but if you don't care these are nice socks.",4
B08MBFGL13,"Great! Very warm, cushioned so my feet didn't ache at work. Nice thickness & didn't slouch down at all thru the day.",5
B08MBFGL13,"Nice socks ,soft and well padded bottoms without being to thick..",5
B08MBFGL13,Typical good socks,5
B08MBFGL13,The socks looked pretty good but were a little thinner than I would have liked. We will see how durable they are,4
B08MBFGL13,"Okay, so I really like wearing cushion socks around my clean house... I wear slippers a lot, but sometimes, I just want nice thick socks to do my things each day! So, I searched and searched for thick socks online, and hoped for the best when I ordered these. The women's athletic cushioned socks I have, are just not cushioned enough either, like men's socks are.So... I searched, and saw these have ""Max Cushion"" and thought, wow, these should be great, right? Wrong.My hubby wears cushioned socks, which got me into this whole thing, so I wanted to get some for myself, instead of using his all the time. I ordered these, and tried them out.... Results: The cushion on these socks is EVEN LESS than regular men's cushioned socks, and wow, I had tight painful rings around my ankles in two locations when I took them off before bed.I contemplated returning them, but thought about how gross it would be to return used socks. So, I decided to cut the tight ankle bands off, and just kept them. I can still use them, they are just not as cushioned as I hoped for.Sorry, but they are NOT ""Max Cushioned"" socks, and even with my normal sized ankles, I couldn't imagine anyone suffering the tight ankle pain of these socks.I wouldn't buy them, guys! Get what you know works, because these are not what I was hoping for.",3
B08MBFGL13,Husband needed a size larger which makes them easier to get on.,5
B08MBFGL13,I love the price and product!,5
B08MBFGL13,Fit good feel good,5
B08MBFGL13,My son absolutely love these! Great fit & comfortable.,5
B08MBFGL13,They are nice looking.  Look comfty.  Like the bottoms are gray so you don't see dirt.  In the future my husband says these are a yes.,5
B08MBFGL13,Purchased as a gift. Great quality and value,5
B08MBFGL13,Quality socks at dirt cheap price.,5
B08MBFGL13,Arrived as described and great quality,5
B08MBFGL13,"Another great product from Hanes. When you have to wear Black socks for work purposes and don't want to ruin high-quality dress socks, these are your go-to. Very comfortable and durable and doesn't retain moisture to keep your feet dry. Would recommend it to anyone.",5
B08MBFGL13,They are very comfortable.,5
B08MBFGL13,"Nice product quality, but a little tight.I was a little confused about the description, 12 socks or 12 pairs of socks.I ordered two packages, sent one back it was 12 pairs.",4
B08MBFGL13,"We will see if the odor fighting treatment wears off before they wear out.  If it does, I'll report back.  So far, so good.",5
B08MBFGL13,Keeps my whole leg warm,5
B08MBFGL13,These socks are amazing to wear the contracts are going to wear for a long time and that's practical you don't have to worry on your floors that you're going to flip,5
B08MBFGL13,These socks are thick enough to give extra comfort but not too thick that it makes your feet sweaty. The elastic in them is just the right elasticity as well to keep them up as far on your calf that they'll reach if thats what you prefer.,5
B08MBFGL13,"Very nice, but elastic a bit tight. Too high for crew.I ordered Fruit of the Loom at the same time. Prefer Fruit of the Loom crew.",4
B08MBFGL13,Decent and warm crew socks. Sizing was accurate too,4
B08MBFGL13,"Good quality, recommended, thank you!",5
B08MBFGL13,"I know they are just socks, but they are really good socks, they don't fall down your leg like a lot of longer socks do. The cushioning is really nice. Just as described which is really nice to find for a change. Thank you.",5
B08MBFGL13,They are higher than the last ones I had by about 3in making them a bit tight at the top.,4
B08MBFGL13,Perfect sizing,5
B08MBFGL13,no holes  no slipperiness  wear like a glove seam quality is great good product all around keep feet dry and wear like a glove,5
B08MBFGL13,"In all fairness, I'm a pretty large guy with a size 12.5 wide shoe. These are billed as fitting size 12 to 14. The quality is great and the foot part fits well. The calf coverage is entirely too tight for me. Possibly perfect for someone whose weight is low 200's or less.",4
B08MBFGL13,"Tight and snugg, they feel good to the feet",5
B08MBFGL13,Hubby loved them.  Fit well.,5
B08MBFGL13,brother got as christmas gift. much needed. great price.,5
B08MBFGL13,"If you are looking for some variety in your sock look no further, these are very comfortable too.",5
B08MBFGL13,"Nice crew socks, good quality, easy fit.",5
B08MBFGL13,"Husband works construction, his work boots are always rubbing holes in his socks. I throw away the holey socks, he then complains about not having socks. These don't have holes yet, and he's not complaining so its awesome!",5
B08MBFGL13,Socks are of very good quality. They were donated from the heart to our homeless Veteran's shelter. Thank you.,5
B08MBFGL13,Purchased as a gift for a friend that prefers this brand for support!,5
B08MBFGL13,Good quality and warm,4
B08MBFGL13,Comfortable.,5
B08MBFGL13,Reasonably thick. They fit well and don't drift downward excessively during the day.  I have placed a second order and replaced most of my tired old socks with these.,5
B08MBFGL13,The socks seem nice and well made but they are too tight for me around the top of the sock.  There is elastic at the top but the socks immediately start to roll down towards my foot and become too tight.  If they didn't roll down and become tight then I would have given a 5 star rating.,3
B08MBFGL13,nice socks for medium calfs or smaller.,5
B08MBFGL13,Great quality,5
B08MBFGL13,"These socks seem to be made for skinny legs. I wear a 10 1/2 - 11 shoe size, so I ordered the 6-12 size. I'm overweight, but most of my excess weight is in my torso with my legs being fairly fit. These socks feel like compression socks, they are so tight around my calves. The foot section is very comfortable, but they are too tight in the upper section around the legs.",3
B08MBFGL13,All 6 pairs arrived in perfect condition,5
B08MBFGL13,These socks are a good price and wear really well.,5
B08MBFGL13,The socks are good quality. They are a bit tight and reach up to the knee.,4
B08MBFGL13,Exactly item- fits well,5
B08MBFGL13,"not as heavy a material as the older hanes socks i have, but comfortable",4
B08MBFGL13,"They're not thin, but they do definitely have an airiness to them that doesn't make them particularly warm to wear in the winter.",4
B08MBFGL13,"My husband wears a size 11.5 shoe, these git tight.  Have worn ok, but he is getting holes in the soles after a few months. We've just not been able to find socks that last like they use to.",3
B08MBFGL13,My husband likes these socks but I don't think they held up very well. Less than a year later and I had to get him new ones,4
B08MBFGL13,Everything was in order.,5
B08MBFGL13,The quality of the socks are good,5
B08MBFGL13,"They feel good, soles are thick and comfy, the stretch is awesome.",5
B08MBFGL13,"These socks work great during spring, summer, and fall.  Thank You!",5
B08MBFGL13,Nice fit and comfortable,5
B08MBFGL13,What I ordered on time!,5
B08MBFGL13,"Seemed like nice socks. Feet fit and remained that way though, upwards of the ankles, after a few washes they seemed to shrink and became uncomfortable, left a waffle pattern on my not very wide ankles/lower legs!",3
B08MBFGL13,Must comfortable pair of taller socks I've owned! They last!,5
B08MBFGL13,Very comfortable,5
B08MBFGL13,Super comfortable and helps with sweaty feet.,5
B08MBFGL13,"These are flexible, dry, comfortable and seem to stay in place... vastly better than the standard ones.",5
B08MBFGL13,"Socks are comfortable, nice and thick and keeps my feet warm.",5
B088JYX7YN,"My Dad loves these. It's his # request for Christmas. They are extremely comfortable super soft even after many washes. They keep you nice and toasty but they wick away so no sweat. The sizing is right on target.Highly recommend for seniors ,they have stretch so movement is easy. My Dad forget he's wearing them. He sleeps in them also. Great quality great price",5
B088JYX7YN,"These were a gift for my husband. He says the are snug, but not uncomfortable. He is amazed at how thin the material is and how warm they keep him. He loves them.",5
B088JYX7YN,"Sizes run small, I wear a 38-40 waist and a 2xl shirt. I ordered the 4xl size and the pants fit perfect but the shirt fits somewhat snug. Other than that they are nice and warm yet breathable.",4
B088JYX7YN,"I bought two sets of these for a recent trip to New York.  With temperatures in the 20's and 30's, I wore these under jeans and a sweater and they kept me plenty warm.  The material is soft and very comfortable.  After two washes, they still fit fine and the material is holding up like new.",5
B088JYX7YN,"Super comfortable, great quality, no holes, n keeps u warm!!!",5
B088JYX7YN,"I wouldn't call this fleece lined, maybe it has a different definition in China? Runs a little small too.",3
B088JYX7YN,"They work nicely for me in Alaska. Nice silk-like hand, good heat retention, breathes reasonably well (stays dry enough).",4
B088JYX7YN,love the way they fit no sag like most waffle weaves I have had. True to size. Arms and legs would work for someone taller than me but the bit extra length does not create to much bulck.  have wourn them now as low as 3 degrees F with minus 15 wind chill and are much warmer than others I have tried.,5
B088JYX7YN,"Great fit, keeps you warm.",4
B088JYX7YN,GREAT BUY WANT MORE!!!,5
B088JYX7YN,Fits well,5
B088JYX7YN,"This material is thick, stretchable , good quality and the fabric lining is well warm. I love this set I purchased a lot for members in my household . We love it.",5
B088JYX7YN,Product as described.fits very well. Keeps me warm in the cold weather.  Did not shrink after machine wash.,5
B088JYX7YN,I used these as my only layer under my hunting clothes and they kept me warm in low 30 and high 20 degree weather in the stand all day.,5
B088JYX7YN,"If you want to stay warm, I highly recommend this product",5
B088JYX7YN,Warm. Could be a little more durable. Overall good,4
B088JYX7YN,MY HUSBAND LOVES THESE.  VERY WARM.,5
B088JYX7YN,Good,4
B088JYX7YN,response was in headline.,5
B088JYX7YN,These got here just in time for the snowstorm. I had to plow snow the next day and these kept me very warm all day.Good quality and fit well under my clothes.,5
B088JYX7YN,These keep you warm all day. I only used the cotton one's for years  until I found these. Lightweight and keeps me warm!!! Worth the price,5
B088JYX7YN,Good product,5
B088JYX7YN,Ordered XL for a L man just in case the pants ran small. The XL is more like a M. They are an uncomfortable tight on him.  The inside is very soft while the outside fabric is silky. Nice color.  Time will tell if they will withstand the cold.,4
B088JYX7YN,I have had since 2022 I believe.  Very good product.,5
B088JYX7YN,This underlayer is perfect to stay warm in the cold.,4
B088JYX7YN,I work outside and these things are great!,5

B088JYX7YN,Good quality fabric. I brought xl size and perfect fit on me.,5
B088JYX7YN,As expected,5
B088JYX7YN,"Got my WEERTI Thermal Underwear for Men Long Johns today. Just tried them on. The single one thing I don't understand about this company is that nowhere is there a size chart which as GOT to cost sales.I made my decision by information I found in the comments. I am 220lbs, 5'11', 44 in the chest and 40-42 down below. My set of 3x WEERTI Thermal Underwear for Men Long Johns fit comfortably, just a little loose. If I were to reorder I would go down a size to see how that would be. Hope this helps if you're anywhere around my build.",5
B088JYX7YN,It soft,5
B088JYX7YN,The WEERTI Thermal Underwear are perfect,5
B088JYX7YN,liked the fit. wear to bed to stay warmer.,4
B088JYX7YN,Product quality is as expected. Sizing runs small.,4
B088JYX7YN,My husband loves them!,5
B088JYX7YN,Superior comfort and fit!,5
B088JYX7YN,"Tight fit, not warm",4
B088JYX7YN,Of the way the material feels on my skin. I especially love the way it keeps me warm in the coldest weather!,5
B088JYX7YN,"I live in a cold area, Ohio, and winter is not something I enjoy. Staying warm during very cold weather is very important to me. The thermals are doing the job to keep me warm and a little more comfortable",5
B088JYX7YN,"I bough this item with the purpose of wearing it underneath a kayaking DRY SUIT.And this works ok, here in Southern California but I'm not sure if it would be ok, by itself, in Northern Europe or Canada, or any other place( really cold ocean water).So I give it 4 stars, only because I'm not sure it would work on really freezing areas.but for southern , warm areas, this is really a good product...thin material, comfortable and warm",4
B088JYX7YN,gift,4
B088JYX7YN,I like the fleece on the inside.,5
B088JYX7YN,"So comfortable and light. Happy with this purchase, keep your body warm.",5
B088JYX7YN,"Made well, keeps me warm.",5
B088JYX7YN,THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND FITS TRUE TO XL= 170 LBS . JUST LOVE THEM AT 20 DIGREES IN THE MOUNTIANS NC.,5
B088JYX7YN,Works great,5
B088JYX7YN,Perfect! Having to order 2 more sets so the first can be washed! Lol  they love them.,5
B088JYX7YN,Great quality. They wash well. I recommend hang drying only.,5
B088JYX7YN,Pending cold-weather assessment.,4
B088JYX7YN,Warm and comfy. Would recommend. Great for winter layering.,5
B088JYX7YN,"I'm 6'1"", 225lbs, medium build. I ordered the XL thermals. The pants fit just above the ankles and the shirt fit perfectly at my wrists. Not too short like many other thermals. They feel very comfortable and breathable. Hope they keep me warm too.",5
B088JYX7YN,"I've used these on my winter trip into West Virginia Mountains for a week and I use these whenever it's very cold weather around here at home because the heat never reaches my bedroom. These thermal undergarments do their job excellently. They are thick enough and very effective. I can walk around the house in only them, 5 minutes after shivering in my full clothes. One of my housemates is tiny and isn't experienced in dressing warm and I WILL be buying her a set, for the sake of not having to watch her shiver and ignore my advice. For people who don't know, typically artificial fabric is much more heat insulating than natural fabric with the acception of Wool, Cashmere, Down, etc of course. What I saying is when you see that a thick snug garment is made of Polyester, you know it will be warm, especially the way this is constructed. Be careful of cotton, the moment cotton becomes wet it will not hold your body heat against you anymore, it will sap it away actually. There is a saying that goes ""Cotton Kills"". It will cause you hypothermia when wet. Wool will not, etc. So stick with man-made warm clothing (Polyester filling puffer jackets, Acrylic, etc) or Wool/Cashmere/Down Feathers(Down Feathers must stay dry too though). Stay warm out there! Stay safe!",5
B088JYX7YN,Como dijeron que era el producto,5
B088JYX7YN,wonderful. keeps my farts in.,5
B088JYX7YN,Are worthless against cold weather. Not worth the trouble to put on if your purpose is protection against cold weather.,3
B088JYX7YN,The item is perfect,5
B088JYX7YN,I have used the old long John's and these are very comfortable to the skin and they worked great!!! Very pleased with this purchase and product!!!,5
B088JYX7YN,Nice for cold weather,5
B088JYX7YN,"I ordered these in 4x and they're way, way too small.  As in the legs won't even go over my feet completely, with the last 4"" of material stuck below my ankles.  As a result these things are low rise... to the point that ""plumbers crack"" is an understatement.  Not that I can bend over without worrying these things will rip apart like Moses parting the Red Sea.For reference as to how small these run, I purchased some Fruit of the Loom waffle thermals in a 3x size and they're so big they literally fall off of me when I stand up.  I had to order them in 2x as they were way too big.  The WEERTI is probably more like a men's size XL and even then only if you have small feet.My impression is also they're not as warm as the old fashioned waffle-style thermals.  Maybe it's because so much of me is still hanging out from them being way too small but I think it's just thin material.  It reminds me of the material that Yoga pants for women are made out of.  Thin and stretchy but not much insulation.If you're a smaller guy and have little feet and skinny ankles and want an extra layer to go clubbing in the winter under your skinny jeans maybe these are for you.  If you're a big dude who wants to go out and run heavy equipment when it's 5F outside without your legs going numb look elsewhere.",4
B088JYX7YN,"Usually buy Med. , reviews suggested one size larger, so I ordered Lg. and they fit perfectly.",5
B088JYX7YN,Excelente,5
B088JYX7YN,I'm 5/8 225lb. I got the 4XL the Thermal Underwear fits good.,5
B088JYX7YN,Product well made but smaller than size claims.,5
B088JYX7YN,Excelente calidad,5
B088JYX7YN,True to size and keeps the warmth in.,5
B088JYX7YN,I work in ag and these things saved my butt. Standing in a cold wind for 12 hours is doable now.,5
B088JYX7YN,its the best thermal suit iv ever seen the inside material is diferent for the outside super comfortable the medium is basically a small thought just a heads up on that,5
B088JYX7YN,"Soft feel, good quality",5
B088JYX7YN,"Like the weight and hand feel.Have not worn it yet only tried on, so I can't speak on pilling yet.",5
B088JYX7YN,"True to size & warm, but after 1 wear, they were heavily pilled (worn under pants with no back pockets)",3
B088JYX7YN,Arrived with a tear in the sewing,3
B088JYX7YN,Not typical thermal underwear. It is warm but runs small,3
B088JYX7YN,good value,5
B088JYX7YN,Arrived in one day. Fit perfectly. Price was way better than Under Armour. Bought this for my son to wear under his marching band uniform once the weather goes cold this fall.,5
B088JYX7YN,"My husband drives truck and rides sxs in the winter in the snow. He needed something a little thicker than what he had. UA brand.These aren't super thick but they are very warm. He is a large guy with a big bottom and these fit great. They are stretchy but don't slid down when he bends over to do chains or what ever. They are thicker than the UA brand and much warmer.  He gets hot easy and he says they do not over heat him though. He thanks me for them every time he wears them.  He is 6 foot tall wears a 3x shirt and 44x 33 pants, I Ordered the four x size (xxxxl) and they fit great without being too tight or too loose.I will buy again if/when these wear out.  The stitching is good I didn't find any flubs. I have washed them a few times and dry on low/ultra low and haven't had any shrinkage problems.",5
B088JYX7YN,"I bought these while preparing for a vacation to the Rockies in Winter. Specifically Utah in December. I wasn't sure how cold it was going to be but I was recommended to pack thermals just in case. I'm glad I did. These were an excellent base layer to have on hand. They are very light yet they really helped keep me warm. My one complaint is that they seemed to tear really easily. The fabric is stretchy to a point but a few times while trying to straighten out the arms or the legs after putting them on my finger nail went straight through the fabric causing a small tear. I don't plan on wearing these as a top layer in any respect so slight visual deformations that don't greatly effect the performance aren't a big deal, but it is worth noting that these are not going to be extremely long term durable wear that will be with me for the long haul. But for the price and the effectiveness of the garments at doing their job, won't complain too much.",4
B088JYX7YN,Soft and so warm,5
B088JYX7YN,I work in the fridge a lot so these undergarments are great. They're also great pajama's. I like how they feel and I sleep like a baby when I use them. Heck I even bought two more of these because of how much I like this.One of my favorite purchases I've done.,5
B088JYX7YN,Warm and comfortable,5
B088JYX7YN,Fit well,5
B088JYX7YN,Very comfortable. Keeps me comfortably warm. Good value.,5
B088JYX7YN,"I bought these to have something with me on a fishing trip to Alaska. Tried them on in the house in California in the A/C and after about half a minute I was sweating and uncomfortable. Soft, stretchy, and VERY warm. No doubt that they will perform perfectly in waders in the Alaskan cold.",5
B088JYX7YN,The products work extremely well.,5
B088JYX7YN,"I purchased a pair for my brother-in-law for his birthday as he is an avid hunter.  He was skeptical at first as he had never heard of the brand but he spent the past weekend hunting and said he never got cold and he loves them.  Asked for more so now I know what to get him for Christmas.According to him, the fit was fantastic, definitely molds to the body and allows free movement.  As he is one of the harder people in my family to buy gifts for I consider this high praise.  Recommend for all hunters or fishermen who are out in the elements early in the day in the winter or outdoors during the winter foul weather.",5
B088JYX7YN,give feeling of warm but not sure after washing,4
B09PF7CGN1,"A couple months back I got on here and ordered some boxer briefs from Fruit Loom. Let me tell ya what crap those boxers were. Every single pair ripped exactly in the same spot in the crotch. I'm talking a massive hole. Like c'mon now. Those type briefs ain't for this dude. No sir. So I threw every single one of them away. I believe within 90 days all 6 pair were trash. These Champion boxer briefs are a different breed tho. They fit really well, they're comfortable, and they don't seem to be falling apart. So no complaints. Been a Champion customer since I was a little kid.",4
B09PF7CGN1,Best I've ever worn!Nice fit!Junk doesn't bunch up.Quality made.Ok value,5
B09PF7CGN1,Fits perfectly and comfortably.,5
B09PF7CGN1,"I have always been a Fruit of the Loom guy.  But lets face it their quality has not been close to what it use to be.  I tried Hanes and they were ok, wearable, but the consistency was not there.  Some were to loose on top or to tight on the bottom legs, and some just seemed 1 size to small all the way round.  I have always liked the Champion company's clothing (comfortable for a man).  So I tried these and they are really really nice.  Half the time I don't realize they are even there.  Excellent quality all around, I would not hesitate to enjoy your undercarriage again.  I will be purchasing these again for sure. As far as sizing I am not skinny 5'8"" and weigh 195, I got the Large and it fits perfect; just a little wiggle room for the boys.",5
B09PF7CGN1,Little tighter than expected.,4
B09PF7CGN1,Good pricing.,4
B09PF7CGN1,These fit well and feel very comfortable,5

B09PF7CGN1,They ride up but my Son still wears them because he likes them.,4
B09PF7CGN1,True to size,4
B09PF7CGN1,Good quality but I should have ordered a size up,5
B09PF7CGN1,Good fit,4

B09PF7CGN1,Were good,4
B09PF7CGN1,muy comodos,5
B09PF7CGN1,Good no complaints,5
B09PF7CGN1,They fit comfortably and last longer with out the grinding feeling,4
B09PF7CGN1,No problems so far,4
B09PF7CGN1,It's still all right.,5
B09PF7CGN1,Love the look of the briefs. Overall fit is a bit tight and they are not as comfortable as I hoped they would be. Fair pricing though and decent product.,4
B09PF7CGN1,"Good fit, nice look, and very comfortable.",5
B09PF7CGN1,"I usually don't spend this much on boxers but decided to spend a bit extra for something high quality and long lasting. I was definitely not disappointed once these boxer briefs have arrived. I was a bit worried about shrinking after washing them but they definitely have stayed true to size after several washes, the fabric is extremely comfortable and seems to be long lasting. I will be ordering another pack soon to cut down on laundry as well! :)",5
B09PF7CGN1,Very comfortable cut. while having a great look with lightweight material and a wonderful value.,4
B09PF7CGN1,This is the brand of cotton boxer briefs that my son has preferred for a while.He notes that these are comfortable  and work well with all the sports he plays.These were sold at a good price.,4
B09PF7CGN1,"My son loves the comfort of this brand. He likes the one that is more silky yet stretchy. We thought this was it. It looks different but will do. It is still well made, not too thick and doesn't ride up.I purchased a set and didn't receive it. I quickly ordered another set and received that set. I was also refunded immediately for the first set I didn't receive.",4
B09PF7CGN1,Fit perfect,5
B09PF7CGN1,Good quality underwear,5
B09PF7CGN1,Did not realize when ordered that these do not have a functional fly.,4
B09PF7CGN1,They fit me well and look nice. I am most likely going to buy another set.,5

B09PF7CGN1,"Maybe I'm just unlucky, my waist size is 30, so I went with small size according to the size chart. But they fit tight. I do like the product, and the price, but their size chart might not be accurate, so you might want to get one size larger if you want to buy it.",3

B09PF7CGN1,"LOOK my Step-son DOES NOT TALJK ABOUT HIS UNDIES WITH ME. However, he has not complained about them and I do the the laundry so they show up to be washed. What more could I ask from him other then to review them himself?? AND THATS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH A TEEN.",5
B09PF7CGN1,"Recently, I found myself in possession of a three-pack of men's underwear that simply shines in all aspects. This excellent product left nothing to be desired, thus earning a solid five-star rating.Right from the start, the superior quality of these undergarments is evident. They are crafted from a blend of fabrics that are soft, breathable, and highly durable, offering both comfort and longevity. The material is gentle against the skin, reducing the risk of irritation, making them ideal for all-day wear.Each pair fits exceptionally well. They provide the perfect balance between snugness and freedom of movement, preventing unwanted bunching without feeling restrictive. The elastic waistband offers a secure fit without digging into the skin, a quality often overlooked in other underwear.One cannot overlook the thoughtfulness in the design. This underwear comes in a range of tasteful, easy-to-match colors that look as good as they feel. The modern yet classic style ensures they suit men of all ages and preferences.A significant benefit is that these undergarments retain their shape and color exceptionally well, even after multiple washes. This suggests high-quality fabric and excellent craftsmanship, meaning you'll be able to enjoy these pieces for a considerable period.In conclusion, this three-pack of men's underwear excels on all fronts. With their superb fit, comfort, style, and durability, they offer excellent value for the price. They stand as an example of what every essential wardrobe item should strive to achieve. I wholeheartedly recommend these to any man in need of quality underwear. A well-deserved five stars for a product that ticks all the boxes.",5

B0CLR98667,"As an outdoor enthusiast who loves hiking, camping, and exploring nature, finding the perfect rain jacket has always been a priority.

It offers a comfortable and relaxed fit, allowing for easy layering over sweaters or fleeces during colder weather. The adjustable cuffs and drawcord hem further enhance the customizability of the fit, ensuring that I can seal out rain and cold air effectively.Additionally, the jacket features two zippered hand pockets, which are not only practical for keeping small essentials secure but also double as ventilation options if needed.In terms of durability, the Columbia Men's Watertight II Rain Jacket has proven to be highly resilient.

I highly recommend the Columbia Men's Watertight II Rain Jacket for anyone in need of a dependable, high-quality rain jacket for their outdoor pursuits",5
B0CLR98667,"I bought this for golf and it works very well.  It's easy to roll up and store in my golf bag and it's not too bulky to wear for golf.  It definitely keeps you dry.  The hood is a bit large, although it will keep your head dry which is what matters.",5
B0CLR98667,"Fits well and appears waterproof. I spent several hours in heavy rain and it didn't get through. My only wish is for an inside pocket, but other than that. Very good product.",5
B0CLR98667,"I have been in the market for a long time for a cheaper raincoat just to keep me dry in the rain. This coat does just that! Its light, but in medium and light rain this coat does the trick!I usually wear a M for everything, but with raincoats I like to size up. I ordered a L size. It fits nicely, but it is a bit smaller then a normal L. If you want a regular fit I recommend ordering a size up",5
B0CLR98667,"Going by the photos here I went for the black jacket, I like it. I find that they run a little big, thankfully Amazon swapped one a size smaller without much hassle. I ran my current one in the wash before I started using it because it had a bit of a factory smell when it arrived, the smell washed right out. I didn't really think it through when I washed it, it's a rain coat and it's not a fan of water. Threw it in the dryer on low and it was ready to wear. It's good for going to the car or wherever like a football game if it's raining, If I worked out in the rain I'd go for something a bit more rugged, it doesn't seem all that tough, but it does seem well made for general purpose.",5
B0CLR98667,Bought this for biking and hiking.  I own other Columbia products and have been happy with them.  Have used this a number of times in the rain and as a windbreaker normally with a sweater underneath.  I haven't experienced any issues with moisture/sweat build up underneath and it tends to breathe well.  I was so happy with it I bought three more for the family after a soaking wet trip to New York where cheaper rain jackets leaked.  This did not leak.  Skip the cheaper ones and just pay a little more for this one.  I'm very happy with it.,5
B0CLR98667,Comfortable fits great pockets deep water proof and wind resistant great price very happy with it.,5
B0CLR98667,"Really impressed with this Columbia Watertight II jacket. When first ordering, I wanted the MED size, but it was out of stock. Anticipating some rainy weather, I opted to deal with the large--and if it didn't fit well--I'd return it. For about $46+ (price has increased to $51+ as of this post), this jacket had all the right qualities I'd been looking for (water and wind resistant/proof, adjustable hood and price). Lucky me! It fits nicely (not as snug as I wanted, but good enough). It's good around the chest area, but a little generous around the waist. Not bad though. Used it twice so far, for riding the bike at night (commuting). I live in the Magic City, so the weather this time of year is often perfect (upper 70s during the day and 60s at night). Well, some nights are a bit nippier (upper 50s), and I'd already ""dealt with"" some cooler night rides. I love that weather too, but didn't want to increase chances of getting sick. Wind doesn't help, and the prediction of rain would really spoil the commute. Even a light mist will soak you in minutes, when traveling at 12-18mph (plus wind). Since we're talking about a hybrid bike with a rack, and not a road bike, the commute usually involves shorts and a shirt in daylight (with a change of clothes inside the knapsack--on the rack), and a return night trip with the possible addition of long sleeve, henley-style shirt. For all you folks up north, my apologies...this review describing relatively nice weather is not meant to cause any issues. Hopefully it can help when the Spring comes around.Well, the Columbia Watertight II packs nicely in a knapsack. There is mention (on the manufacturer's label) of some ""hidden"" pocket for packing it. The mysterious pocket is REALLY well hidden, for I have yet to find it. I decided to fold the jacket on itself, roll it up and stow it in the hood (possible missing pocket?), then stuff it in a 8.5""x11"" padded envelope (to save space in the knapsack). The padded envelope is not essential, but it keeps things separated. Though not very pretty, it works for now. I'm sure a nylon zip bag would be even better.So far, I've used the jacket twice. Both nights were clear and cool (upper 50s, maybe low 60s). With the flu going around, I didn't want to tempt fate. Well, let me tell you...this jacket ROCKS! When I first tried it on (at home, of course), it was a bit awkward. The zipper (a nylon flap covers the zipper making this a right-handed zip) is a bit smaller than normal (not sure why, since it's an easy fix), but comes with a cord attached to help pull it up or down. It zips cleanly both up and down. There are velcro strips (hook and loop, if you prefer) along the zipper line, to help seal the front of the jacket from wind and rain. The velcro can be a little annoying at first, especially to those of us not used to dealing with the zip+velcro combination. After wearing a few times, it's no longer an issue. When un-zipping with one hand, simply use the other to help un-stick the velcro.On the road, this Columbia Watertight II jacket blocks or diverts the wind completely. The material really doesn't let any wind through. The hood is adjustable, with a nifty tighten-loosen system. A stretchy cord woven into the hood has ends that exit at the base of the hood, on either side. Each of those ends fit through a small cylinder (on each side of the hood) that gently holds the cord snug and in place. Pull on the cord just enough, and it will either loosen or tighten. Pretty good system, since the material is light weight. There is a token lip/visor at the top of the hood, but no support or insert to keep its shape correctly. Ah well, not bad anyway. The jacket interior is lined with a mesh material that feels nice and it prevents your arms from sweating directly onto the inside of the nylon jacket material.On a cool night (upper 50s), this Columbia Watertight II jacket was immediately comfortable and retained body heat inside. Within seconds, I felt the difference between just wearing the two shirt combo (short sleeve + henley) and adding this very lightweight jacket. While riding, it was a pleasure to wear, by allowing me to keep comfy and preventing wind from buffeting my ears (the wind isn't bad at all, but seems to pick up tremendously while riding). After arriving home with some heat build up, the jacket was very easy to remove. My arms did not stick to the inside and I wasn't sweaty. As mentioned above, it's very light, so you can hang it anywhere. Due to the good heat retention, my guess is that it has limited breathability (Mr. Webster, is that a word?). For now that's fine. Am thinking that if it does become an issue, a trusty old henley underneath will solve the problem.I give this product 5 stars for wind resistance and heat retention in cool temps. I'm confident it would keep you somewhat comfortable down into the windy 40s, with just a long sleeve shirt underneath. For the 30s, I'd be sure to wear more layers (including a sweater). Other buying options I checked into were on Columbia dot com's website. It's on sale there for $59.99, but also involves ""points"".Keep an eye out for follow up review after the rains come...",5
B0CLR98667,"The rain jacket came in on time and properly packaged. I purchased this rain Jacket for a gift for someone that works around airplanes. The recipient liked the color and style , says that it is perfect for rainy weather and chilly nights.",5
B0CLR98667,"This jacket is lightweight and durable.  I've used it in several rainstorms, and it has worked fine.  I have not yet worn it in a heavy downpour or an hours-long rain event, so can't say how it will do but for short rain events it is waterproof.",5
B0CLR98667,This is comfortable. Highly recommend.,5
B0CLR98667,Really Waterproof,5
B0CLR98667,I was looking for a nice waterproof rain jacket for my trip to Scotland. In Scotland I only had to wear it one time (not complaining).  I left it in the rear of the tour van for several days. On the last day and drop off at the hotel I left if behind in the van. Long story short the tour company mailed to me (I paid the postage) to get it back. I have worn it a few times since and its a nice jacket.,5
B0CLR98667,"Lightweight, warm, well made.  Worth the money",5
B0CLR98667,"I went one size up, usually I'm XL, but went XXL based on reviews and glad I did since I wear layers underneath.  The hood holds up pretty well, unless the wind is clocking over 30 steady and I'm walking right into it.  On the Oregon coast, you can get some gnarly winds and sideways rain, and I'm happy with how it holds up.",5
B0CLR98667,Excellent rain jacket,5

B0CLR98667,Fits well.  Look forward to using it when it actually rains instead of a blizzard!,4
B0CLR98667,"According to amazon I got my first jacket back in the ancient times of 2003, they last 10-20 years of constant use in the rainy lands of washington state. Worth the price the bother and the wait to get a new one. I will cheerfully state I am a cheap bastard and utility for price should be noticed.",5
B0CLR98667,"really like this jacket up until it was stolen from me but whatever. works great against wind and light rain, dont expect it to keep you dry in a real rain storm",5
B0CLR98667,Must have for winters,5
B0CLR98667,"So, I live in the Seattle area and needed to walk more for my health.  Having said that, it rains in Seattle a lot in the winter.  I didn't want to use an umbrella and determined the best route was a waterproof rain jacket.  We've all had rain jackets before that work great, until it really starts raining.  I came across this Columbia ""Watertight"" jacket and decided to give it a try.  After wearing it almost every day for a month in the rain, I can tell you I come back from my walk dry on the inside every time.  If you are looking for something that actually keeps you dry - this is worthy of a look.",5
B0CLR98667,If you sweat in it you become wet,4
B0CLR98667,It is a great jacket. Great quality. Fits true to size.,5
B0CLR98667,Excelente  calidad buen precio  para tus viajes,5
B0CLR98667,Very nice raincoat/windbreaker. Very comfortable and fit well.,5
B0CLR98667,"Buen producto,  ligera y comoda",5
B0CLR98667,The style and material,5
B0CLR98667,"This jacket is great for a light to moderate rain - I live in Seattle, and 99% of the time it's perfectly up to the task because it rarely rains very hard here. BUT... if you do get a heavy rain, the way the jacket falls down your front (my front, at least) means that if you're not also wearing rain-proof bottoms, the front of your pants and everything in your pant pockets will be getting absolutely soaked. It's like there's a magical wicking property that takes all the water that touches the jacket and redirects it straight to the tops of your thighs. It's wild and surprising, because again, most of the time it offers perfect protection.Also, a minor gripe for everyday use: there's little velcro bits that hold a secondary flap all the way down over the front zipper. There's also exposed velcro on the sleeve cuffs. If you like to walk around with your jacket unzipped (as one does when it's not actively raining), the velcro from the zipper area will without fail find itself in proximity to the velcro on your sleeve, where it will 100% be getting stuck every few minutes until you zip the bottom of you jacket back together. It's fairly annoying.",4
B0CLR98667,"I was pleasantly surprised how lightweight, breathable, and water repellant this jacket is, even compared to a similar $400 jacket I own. I live in the Pacific NW, so I take my rain gear seriously, and this jacket is seriously good.",5
B0CLR98667,Excellent jacket,5
B0CLR98667,Excelente Precio- calidad  cumplieron con la entrega pactada,5
B0CLR98667,Me queda muy grande,4
B0CLR98667,It will do good in the rain for hours.  I work outdoors so I need one for heavy rain.  This will work for normal use & keep you dry,4
B0CLR98667,Really good quality and comfort.,5
B0CLR98667,"My previous Columbia jacket (Diablo Creek rain shell) was also made with ""Omni-Tech"" material. However it was both a nylon and polyester blend. It never wrinkled and even after three winters and two international plane/cruise trips it looked brand new. This jacket has thinner material and has a 100% nylon shell and feels more plastic. It came with moderate wrinkles/creases out of the package that are only slowly fading. This jacket will need to be babied and hung after each use to minimize wrinkles/creases. I almost returned it but winter is here and I needed a light-weight rain jacket, so I'll live with it. I don't see how they can call it the same Omni-Tech material when there are obvious differences in quality and composition.",3
B0CLR98667,"I used this for biking , yes it is waterproof and get me dry , but it only has 2 large pockets by both your sides by waist . Well that is fine but if you pedaling your biker your knees keep hitting what ever is in those pockets (like my phone)I was expecting a chest pocket or something not by waist high",4
B0CLR98667,"I bought a large. I'm 6'4"", 180lbs, thin athletic build with longer arms. Fit is a little baggy but for what this is (a rain jacket) it's perfectly acceptable as this allows for:1. An underlayer, which you're going to need if it's wet AND cold.2. Greater airflow to help with breathability and moisture (sweat) buildup inside the jacket when its rainy and warm...or you're just active in the rain. The netting helps by keeping the outer shell off your skin. For those complaining about it not fitting skin tight, you really dont want that with a rain jacket built with this type of waterproof material since it doesn't really breathe as well as gore-tex. Having it a tad bit baggy with the netting is ideal.As far as the claims go with this being ""fake"", I highly doubt it. I believe the listing hasn't been updated to reflect the manufacturers cosmetic changes, which companies do due to whatever reason. My jacket is still ""waterproof"" and performs as expected. While it does not say ""packable"" anywhere, it still has the function as intended (see pic). In case you dont know how, simply pull the left pocket inside out and stuff the remainder of the jacket inside the pocket. The zipper has a double sided pull tab and will close accordingly.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of it's velcro overflap for the main zipper. While the overflap is needed to help keep water from leaking through, the zipper constantly snags when zipping/unzipping the jacket (even after intial velcro seperation..it'll just restick) so you have to be mindful...not a quick fluid action.Everything else is great: velcro tabs on the cuffs to tighten up and keep water out, drawstring on the waist to help keep moisture and drafts out, hood fits well, velcro tab on the collar to keep out water, etc etc.Unless you want to spend alot more money on a super high quality jacket made of gore-tex, or are happy with the non-breathability of those cheap ""plastic"" rain jackets they sell at the box chains for $20, this is an ideal, quality compromise between the two.",4
B0CLR98667,Very nice jacket that fits great and looks great,5
B0CLR98667,"Some reviews here are stating these jackets are fake Columbia due to the logo not being embroidered, the omni-tech label on the sleeve being different, not having a tag that says ""packable"" in the pocket, etc.Prior to purchasing, I went to Columbia.com and in the photos of this jacket (across multiple colors) you can see the logo and omni-tech sleeve label are the same as what's being posted as ""fake"" here. So I'm fairly confident this is the real deal Columbia Watertight II jacket. I'm guessing Columbia just decided they could save a few bucks by not embroidering their logo, simplifying the omni-tech label, and not sewing a tag that says ""packable"" inside the pocket. Admittedly the updated logo and omni-tech label don't look as nice, but as long as the jacket performs as intended, these shouldn't be deal breakers (not for me at least).As for the jacket, it looks, feels, and fits pretty much identical to my older Watertight II jacket. I'm 6'2 and weigh 230lbs and the XL fits me fine and had plenty of room to layer a fleece underneath for some extra warmth without restricting movement in the jacket.I haven't tested the water repellency of this particular jacket yet, but anticipate that it will perform the same as my older Watertight II and will block the wind just as well too.I use these jackets for general use on rainy days (commuting, running errands, walking the dog, day hikes, etc) and they perform great for those purposes through spring, summer, fall. I also use them in winter with a fleece, etc underneath, but that's typically if I'm not outside for extended lengths of time or running errands and will be in and out from the car to shops and vice versa. I live in Chicagoland and have an above avg tolerance for cold, just to give a baseline.If you're a hardcore outdoors type, you may want to invest in a different jacket. However, if you're looking for a solid rain jacket for general daily life that will provide years of use and cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 (I got lucky and got mine for $30 after tax) this would be a good choice.",5
B0CLR98667,Very impressed with this jacket. Does a great job keeping me dry even with the heaviest downpours.  Put a sweatshirt underneath it and you have a nice windbreaker during the cooler days.,4
B0CLR98667,I like that the jacket compresses well so it fits well into my luggage for travel or mymessenger bag for carrying around town. It also doesn't weigh much.What I don't like is that there are only the two hand warmer pockets. I would have preferred that it at least had a breast pocket to hold my phone or other things. Even better would have been additional inside pockets.One positive is that the two packets it does have are zippered.,4
B0CLR98667,"Fits true to size, and the material feels good too.  A very nice jacket.",4
B0CLR98667,As advertised,4
B0CLR98667,"Got it for a long trip and big enough to wear over a warm, not waterproof, jacket.Fits well.",5
B0CLR98667,"Mine is a very bright orange and when I ride my bike people can see me from a long distance. Plus, it is water resistant, nearly waterproof, so here on the coast the jacket is my goto nine months of the year. I like the features that it has, however, were I do design this jacket I would add a detachable hood, a couple of front inside pockets, even a back pouch. Additional features would make it an even more attractive product.",5
B0CLR98667,"Light weight, waterproof and no interior sweat buildup. Great for hot weather rain.",5
B0CLR98667,Muy muy buena,5
B0CLR98667,Not worth price.,3
B0CLR98667,Good - not that great for the price,3
B0CLR98667,"I am very pleased with this Columbia jacket.  It is waterproof and keeps the wind out.  When indoors it does not trap heat, and I stay comfortable wearing it.",5
B0CLR98667,Does what it's supposed to and keeps the water out. Sleeve length fits like they're regular size and could use two or three more inches. The sleeves are notably shorter than other Columbia jackets I have in the same size and wouldn't recommend if you have average length or longer arms,3
B0CLR98667,Perfect jacket for waterproof layering over other wear. I ordered one-size larger for wearing over a fleece jacket in cool fall weather.,5
B0CLR98667,"The jacket kept me dry during a rainy trip to Scotland. I got the large size recommended, and it was a bit loose, but the medium, particularly with a sweater under it, might have been too snug. Not especially attractive, but utilitarian and easy to travel with.",4
B0CLR98667,It keeps you dry,4
B0CLR98667,"GOOD, I USE IT FOR OFF ROAD MOTORCYCLES. IT WITHSTANDS LIGHT RAIN",4

B0CLR98667,"We just returned from a week in Paris.  A couple of weeks before the trip I checked the weather and found we were in for lots of rain.  So much for April in Paris!  this rain jacket review appeared a week before the trip in NY Times Wirecutter, and I jumped.  I bought the Columbia Men's Watertight II from Amazon and it arrived the next day.  It worked perfectly.  We had umbrellas but I didn't need one, water rolled right off.  Despite the rain, the temperature was mild, so the light-weight jacket was just right.  When we went indores it was easy to roll up into my shoulder bag.  Merci beaucoup Wirecutter & Amazon!",5
B0CLR98667,"I've ordered rain gear before on Amazon, and I've always been disappointed with the cheap plastic feel of the off-brands. I decided to get the better quality Columbia jacket this time, and I'm happy with it. I went with the medium because I don't like an overly baggy coat. The fit is perfect. I'm 6 ft and slim build. The arm lengths are just right. It is a light weight sturdy jacket. Good for keeping you dry, but probably not too warm (nice for hiking).",4
B0CLR98667,"Good quality, lightweight and comfortable. You can take your regular size, but I sized up to have a looser fit. Also, I am 6.1 (185cm) tall, and the sleeves are quite long.",5
B0CLR98667,"Good jacket, runs large(r). I had a version of this before and it was water tight.",4
B0CLR98667,Great for wind resistance and rain. Wore everyday during trip to Ireland. Awesome quality. You can ball it up and stuff in bag then take out and wear and looks great. A XXL would fit perfect but I went up a size so I can wear a sweatshirt or fleece underneath.,5
B0CLR98667,"This jacket is a decent choice for daily use, such as commuting to work/school etc. It would also be a good choice for more laid back camping/outdoor activities.  Its light and packs down well. It is waterproof and has kept me dry in some pretty heavy downpours. And while technically the material is breathable, it is very limited and will definitely build up condensation on the inside quickly if exerting yourself. The wicking effect just takes too long on this level of material. You need to spend  at least 4 times as much money to get a truly breathable jacket, able to stand up to more rigorous outdoor activities.On a side note. I've read a few comments about these jackets possibly being knock offs, based on the logo not being a sewn on design, and some other cosmetic differences.  I have a couple of older Columbia jackets that also have the swn on logos etc.  If you go to Columbia's official website (which is what I did after reading comments about possible fake jackets) the images for this jacket (and many others) clearly show that the logo etc are some kind of printed on design. Not the sewn on kind. My guess is they switched to printed designs at some point, and some of the older stuff with the sewn designs is still in circulation along with the newer designs.",4
B09G8LCNHM,I ordered two packs of these t-shirts.  They are as advertised. Very comfortable and light weight.  True to size. The navy blue is so dark I confused them as being black. Nice shirts would buy again.,5
B09G8LCNHM,"Excellent, high-quality, comfortable and practical item. True to size.",5
B09G8LCNHM,"This set of three size Large Nautica V-Necked t-shirts were just delivered today.  My husband immediately went to try one on.  I have gotten him other brands over the years, but thought this year I would get Nautica, since I've been buying him Nautica underwear for years.  Well, the fit is great, it looks good, and is perfect for him to wear under his dress shirts.  The shirts are very soft 100% cotton and feel nice to the touch.  These were delivered at 1:27 pm, and he liked them so much, less than an hour later, now, I have ordered him a second set of three.  I would recommend these.  Of course they haven't been laundered yet, so I will update after that.",5
B09G8LCNHM,"Thin fabric, too short, over size. General medium",3
B09G8LCNHM,"The thickness, warmth an feel of this t-shirt makes for a nice first layer on winter work-outside days.",5
B09G8LCNHM,"This is the worst set of T shirts I've purchased in my life. Cheap fabric, deep feminine neck and horrible fitting. I'm shocked that a brand like Nautica could pass these products and a brand like Amazon could sell this in the marketplace. These T-shirts are not even worth $3.I tried to send this for refund but sending this back to Amazon from my country is just too complicated. It's sad that Amazon has stopped pick up services for its international customers. In past I could easily make a return and pick up request but now they've deleted this option.My money has gone waste. This is my last apparel purchase on Amazon. I will continue to order other products but never buy T- shirts here again.",1
B09G8LCNHM,Bonitos colores y buena calidad,5
B09G8LCNHM,La tela es excelente,5
B09G8LCNHM,easy to wash keep clean good cotton,5
B09G8LCNHM,"I am a female that likes basic black cotton v necks. I need to replace many black cotton V neck tshirts. I am 5'4"" and a bit curvy. I once upon a time liked the mosimo boyfriend tshirt, but the cut has changed and mine are worn out. I can go swimming in your average mens XL basic t. What I want, nice roomy fit (boob accomodation), a nice deep v, and booty coverage for wearing with leggings.SO far I have compared this product and the 2(x)ist 3 pack. I kept this product.I actually liked the 2(X)IST better as the black is true black and the fabric is a thicker. I returned this pack due to fit. These are long in length, almost 2-4 inches longer, but too ""slim fit"" to accomodate curves.The Nautica three pack fits wonderfully. The V is nice and deep, but not to deep. My least favorite aspect is Black was not available in XL. I went with ""New black"". Why would anyone aim for the look of a faded, slightly brown black t-shit?I want to order more as they fit nicely, but not happy with the color. I was also hoping for heavier weight cotton.ALSO these TShirts were so chemically soaked for shipping that I had a horrific allergic reaction to trying them on and having them in a laundry basket in my room. I had to wash them 2 times before wearing.",4
B09G8LCNHM,Value for money,5
B09G8LCNHM,Good quality. Good value. Flattering.,5
B09G8LCNHM,very comfortable,5
B09G8LCNHM,"I like the material but I don't like the size of  the V-neck, to wide..",3
B09G8LCNHM,"High Quality materials that feel very well put together, this is the first undershirt that I have truly LOVED everything from Day 1.The fit feels very tailored and looks very sliming, the colors are VERY strong and have not faded over time, and last but certainly not least --- the V Neck is the perfect size. So many times I have gotten other shirts where the V is so deep it looks ridiculous, and other times where it just isn't enough.This is the perfect undershirt and I refuse to buy anything different going forward.",5
B09G8LCNHM,"Excelente producto, sin embargo la talla es muy grande y tuve que devolverlo.",5
B09G8LCNHM,Nice shirts but they run big. Size down for the best fit.,3
B09G8LCNHM,Does shrink a little bit and a little expensive for that product,5
B09G8LCNHM,"They are a little big, but they are comfortable to be at home chilling.",5
B09G8LCNHM,Wow beyond my expectations.  I love the deep v cut not found on most v neck tees.  Fit is comfortable and just right for my needs.  Love the little Nautica symbol at bottom.  So tired of the overpriced name brand symbols and brands that everybody has.  These look classy as well as fit and finish is great.  Recommended,5
B09G8LCNHM,"I buy Nautica 100% cotton t-shirts v-neck & crew neck every year. The crew were fine but the v-neck are terrible quality.Must have got a knock off package of Nautica t-shirts. These are paper thin cotton (can see my skin through the material) and it's not soft cotton, at all. Washed them and the length shrunk up to way above belt level.Also purchase two 3-packs of crew necks and they were fine.",5
B09G8LCNHM,"This package of the T-shirts is great!  Best colors for me and the material is super soft. Fit is perfect,  as in a small fits well and is not too tight. There is a Nautica logo on the bottom left of the shirt that is felt looking. I recommend these T-shirts.",5
B09G8LCNHM,Nice lightweight tees for summer.,5
B09G8LCNHM,El material muy delgado,4
B09G8LCNHM,"My husband likes the length n color of these t shirts , length was very important , other t shirts would show some of his stomach, he did not like . We will be getting more of these",4
B09G8LCNHM,Soft cotton that's a comfortable fit.,5
B09G8LCNHM,What can I say? Nautica always does it right!,5
B09G8LCNHM,The large fit perfectly after washing. They do shrink after washing!!!,5
B09G8LCNHM,Each one came with extra shoulder bumps or notches like they had been hung on a hanger for 5 years and stretched out before being shipped out. And the v-neck part was VERY deep.,1
B09G8LCNHM,Not happy.  Appears as thin material tend to shrink,3
B09G8LCNHM,Showed too much of the neck /chest area,3
B09G8LCNHM,"I bought these for my boyfriend. They are very nice shirts, but after one wash they shrank down a size! I had no problem returning them and ordering a size up. Save yourself the hassle and order one size bigger than your usual.",4
B09G8LCNHM,I am not sure that it is original,4
B09G8LCNHM,"I like them so much, finally I founded a cotton very light and they fit very well!",5

B09G8LCNHM,Hangs great and material is super soft! Will buy more,5
B09G8LCNHM,Great package of t-shirts - very comfy and they are softening up with each wash.  Wish the V Neck had been a little deeper though.  Great value.,4
B09G8LCNHM,"I regret this purchase. These T-shirts have no shape, and they are really very thin.",2
B09G8LCNHM,"Bought these t shirts for my Dad. They are sift. They wash nice. Bought him a large, true to size. Washed them over 5 times,no fading on the black yet.",5
B09G8LCNHM,Good for what I purchased them for and that is a comfortable Cotton shirt to sleep in,4
B09G8LCNHM,Soft material and proper cut for undershirt use.,4
B09G8LCNHM,"The material is thin and good.The v-neck is too low for me, hope it will fit better after couple of washes.",4
B09G8LCNHM,Son camisas frescas y de buena calidad,5
B09G8LCNHM,This lightweight material shrinks/wrinkles slightly. I wouldn't recommend it for an outter shirt unless you don't mind looking below par,3
B09G8LCNHM,The product was good . Three stars for the manufacturer . The carrier service stink my package was opened my ring pic is working fine . Rush rush is costly .,2
B09G8LCNHM,Great set of shirts,5
B09G8LCNHM,"For the price, it's an OK shirt. For the brand, it's a big disappointment. It doesn't feel like a genuine item.",3
B09G8LCNHM,It's a pretty lame shirtsNot what I excepted,3
B09G8LCNHM,"Too thin , basically see-through, and too short for general wear. Can't be tucked in at all.",3
B09G8LCNHM,"Good product, good price,  I do recommend.",5
B09G8LCNHM,The fabric is soft and hubby is really happy with the materialHe wears it under his flannel shirts,5

B09G8LCNHM,"The shirts are very thin , feels like a translucent shirt. The  v neck is very low ,not what I was expecting .",3
B09G8LCNHM,The fabric feels good next to my skin. They wash up nicely.,5
B09G8LCNHM,"If you are looking for the old quality Nautica t shirts, look for another brand. These are very light almost transparent, they are not as long as they used to be and when you open the package, there is a strong chemical scent emitting from them. Some mentioned the printed logo vs the embroiled one, these are the printed one.",2
B09G8LCNHM,Comoda,4
B09G8LCNHM,Fits well and the quality is amazing. Beyond meet my expectations. Will purchase again.,5
B09G8LCNHM,N/A,4
B09G8LCNHM,"When I compared my new Nautica T-shirts with the similar ones I bought in November 2016 the new ones seemed more flimsey.  I weighed them.  The new ones weighed 120 grams; the old ones weighed 139.  The new ones are also more see-through.  When I back-lit both of them, the older ones let through noticeably less light, as you see in the photo.  The old ones were made in Bangla Desh; the new ones were made in India.",3
B09G8LCNHM,Wore all summer long... wash n wear pefectly!,5
B09G8LCNHM,I was hoping for better quality. These are average at best.,3
B09G8LCNHM,"shirts are cheaply made. the shoulders do not fit properly, looks like the puffy shirt in the seinfeld show.i kept them and hoped they would be ok after a few washes but one of them is unwearable. i will wear them for work but it looks too foolish to wear to go out in publc",1
B09G8LCNHM,"These are very soft and comfortable, but the edge at the collar does not stay in shape after a few washes and a couple of them developed holes after just a couple of washes.",4
B09G8LCNHM,"Buena tela, colores como en la imagen",5
B09G8LCNHM,"My brother if almost 6ft with broad shoulders and this shirt fits his shoulders waaay to big and has such a large V cut it made him look gay (like a woman with a deep v shirt) so my brother dave it to my mom who is a size D and the V cut finally looks nice but the shirt is still far too wide even though my mom has large shoulders too. I think this type of shirt will not fit anyone big or small. Size XL was too large and my mom is 3x and it's too large for her too. Sizing if just waaay off. But! Feels nice, soft, and airy. Just looks terrible on either gender.",1
B09G8LCNHM,"took XL, seems to be bit larger then other brands",4
B09G8LCNHM,Buen producto!,5
B09G8LCNHM,Good quality and a great fit.I purchased medium.,4
B09G8LCNHM,Material is very sofe and well fitted.,5
B09G8LCNHM,"I don't know what's up with these, because I've bought them before in white, but these are awful. The quality if the fabric feels really rough. The v is SUPER deep. It also runs big (might be better after drying, but I'm not interested in finding out). The quality of these vs the last time I bought a pack is crazy different. No way Nautica is trying to pass this off!",1
B09G8LCNHM,To low on the v neck,3
B09G8LCNHM,"I ordered size Large, unfortunately it's very big, extremely long, the arms are massive and long, almost like an XXL, Don't recommend.",3
B09G8LCNHM,The material is rough and thin. The v neck is a deep vneck. The George brand at Walmart is favorable to this,2
B09G8LCNHM,Great material absolutely smooth totally recommended,5
B09G8LCNHM,100% cotton,5
B09G8LCNHM,"I bought these shirts in 2013 and loved them. The fit, the quality, and that the logo was out of sight. After 8 years of almost weekly wear, they only just started showing their age. So I ordered some new ones. What a disappointment!! The material is so thin! I compared to my old shirts, and despite hundreds of washes, these new shirts are still thinner! Not what I would expect from the brand. Not worth it, in my opinion.",2
B09G8LCNHM,The size was too large,3
B09G8LCNHM,Shirts are of good quality but too wide on midsectio,2
B09G8LCNHM,"3 shirts arrived with a 'medium' label, but in reality one of them (the white one) was much larger than the others (as if it were an XL size)",1
B07B9FD9H5,The material and style are great. I'm a size 9 so I was at the top of the size range that I bought. They are snug but not tight. Very nice.,5
B07B9FD9H5,"Socks seemed decent quality out of the package, but are literally falling apart at the seams the first morning of the first day I am wearing them!  DO NOT BUY",1
B07B9FD9H5,"I have worn these socks most every day for about 6 months. They are A+. Not to tight, about medium weight., convenient to put on, marker on the bottom toe and permeant crease  So that you always put them on right.They also feel good to wear.",5
B07B9FD9H5,"I was looking forward to upgrading my collection of old stretched out dress socks and was excited when these socks arrived.  I washed them and they came out very soft.  When I put them on and went out, they were loose and scrunched up as I walked to the point where my shoes were very uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, these socks are going into the trash and I have to start all over.",1
B07B9FD9H5,Good socks,4
B07B9FD9H5,"Patterns are small and cute but, after being washed and dried, the socks twist out of shape, they do not lie flat.So, you must hand smooth them back into shape to fold and put away.Will not repurchase! (From the wife)",1
B07B9FD9H5,These socks are comfortable but the quality is dismal. By the third wearing holes had formed in the toe area. Not recommended.,1
B07B9FD9H5,The socks are warm and they look nice!The elastic stays up and does not slide down your leg.,5
B07B9FD9H5,"The styles are great, but literally from the first time I wore these, they showed wear at the toes because the fabric is so thin. There's no reinforcement at the toes like so many other brands. After a few wears, I'm starting to throw them out as they have holes already! I keep my toes very well manicured but these socks are so poor quality! I have worn other socks, and gotten years out of them. I have never ever in all my life had a pair of socks that blew out so quickly! And the Seller doesn't even respond to concerns! You will notice that most of the positive reviews were directly after receiving the socks , obviously most people don't go back and update it. Avoid and buy something better!",1
B07B9FD9H5,Ordered these socks to replace some old for Business and Casual use. Great price for a package of socks. Not too thin and or thick. True to fit and good quality. Elasticity is retained and performs as expected.,5
B07B9FD9H5,"These are perfect, no seams, super soft",5
B07B9FD9H5,Wore a pair of socks to the office and next thing you know I feel a breeze on my toes take my foot out the shoe and there a big hole in the sock I love the design but sucks it only lasted a few hours. Hopefully they can send a replacement,1
B07B9FD9H5,Thin and stylish.,5
B07B9FD9H5,"These socks are for one of several Christmas ""Angel Tree"" packages I put together for an assisted-living facility. This item was requested on one of the cards on the tree. Very pleased with the quality & am sure the recipient will be thrilled to have nice, new dress socks for the holidays.",5
B07B9FD9H5,Cuts off the circulation in my legs. I would have a ring around my calf for hours after taking these off and I never could pull them up like they are supposed to be. Made for skinny feet and calves.,1
B07B9FD9H5,"These 6 pairs of men's dress socks were a great value and the designs were stylish. The price was very affordable for the quality. My only wish is that there had been an option for a wider variety of colors, rather than just dark or light shades. Otherwise, these socks would definitely deserve a 5-star rating.",4
B07B9FD9H5,"Nice look, comfortable, good value. Well made.",5
B07B9FD9H5,ok,4
B07B9FD9H5,"They were a Christmas gift for DH.  Yep.  Socks.  But, he needed them, and he says they are comfortable and he likes them.  All is good!",5
B07B9FD9H5,These socks are a good % cotton.  Which is exactly what his preference is.  While being handsome dress socks.  They are stretchy yet breathable.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Good for the price and fits well.,4
B07B9FD9H5,They are very comfortable,5
B07B9FD9H5,Good quality product,5
B07B9FD9H5,A good price for great looking socks!,5
B07B9FD9H5,"I bought a pack of these eighteen months ago and another pack 11 months ago, and rarely wear other socks.  So I estimate each sock has been worn once every 1-2 weeks.  I haven't had any holes, including in my usual wear spots, in that time.  (I will note I always hang my laundry to air dry, which probably keeps them in better shape than if i was using a dryer.)",5
B07B9FD9H5,The sizing was correct and they fit like I wanted them to.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Great fit and just what I wanted out of dress socks!,5
B07B9FD9H5,I prefer a little thicker sock,4
B07B9FD9H5,Attractive and durable,5
B07B9FD9H5,Product received as ordered.,5
B07B9FD9H5,QUALITY PRODUCT,5
B07B9FD9H5,I have never really liked dress socks but these ones were a winner. Highly recommend!,5
B07B9FD9H5,Good socks. Stretch out a little bit at top of sock after use,4
B07B9FD9H5,Great value. Very comfortable and great material,5
B07B9FD9H5,this socks color little different than the photo.,3
B07B9FD9H5,Nice quality. Thin like my hubby needs.,4
B07B9FD9H5,My husband wears a lot of khakis to work and needed new socks to go with them. We couldn't find any until I thought of Amazon and this set of socks is perfect. The patterns are subtle but nice.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Good socks,4
B07B9FD9H5,"The quality of these thin socks is fine other than the fact that they shrink. I bought two sizes, and even the one hat is too big for me is now very tight on the legs (so they will stay up) and  significantly smaller--I am not overweight, nor do I have wide calves. If I had a man's feet of the right size, they'd be tight on my feet as well.",3
B07B9FD9H5,Nice comfortable socks,5
B07B9FD9H5,Not sure how long they will hold up for. After only 2 weeks of wearing they seem like they are already thinner than when delivered. Staying hopeful.,4
B07B9FD9H5,"Feel great. Great patterns. Ankle portion goes a little higher than I would like. A little thin, may have to darn at some point. Would purchase again.",5
B07B9FD9H5,"Socks look good but fabric is very thin and cheap. On the other hand, the price was low",3
B07B9FD9H5,"Good quality,  stay in place, right sized and are wearing well.",5

B07B9FD9H5,Not made in chinaGood qualityGood price point,5
B07B9FD9H5,Sock hold up until dog chewed them...so I bought another pack.Comfortable and maintain their structure.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Socks are of good quality.,5
B07B9FD9H5,The socks are for a 90 year old man for Father's day. I bought one pair at Christmas for him and he loves them so much he wears them all the time so I bought a 6 pack . Cannot wait to see his face when he opens his gift. They give him so much comfort and they are a very cool sock to wear in the summer as well.,5
B07B9FD9H5,"They Were for my dad, he told me they were great that he was happy with them",5
B07B9FD9H5,"Sock quality is as you would expect at this price point. However, they do run small. I am a size 8.5 and the 6-9 size is way too small to fit. If you are on the border of two sizes definitely go with the larger option.",3
B07B9FD9H5,Many socks I have ordered before did not fit my feet; these did.,5
B07B9FD9H5,I'll buy these again when I need them in another 5+ years. They're well built and they'll probably last much longer than 5 years.,5

B07B9FD9H5,Great material,5
B07B9FD9H5,Superb socks!,5
B07B9FD9H5,"These socks are comfortable , airy , and durable . Feels so great on my feet .",5
B07B9FD9H5,I don't know how well they fit.  I am sending them back because they are darker than they appeared in the product photos.  The photo is not a good representation of the socks.,3
B07B9FD9H5,Look and feel great! Would definitely buy more.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Fit well. Good design good quality washed well.,5
B07B9FD9H5,They are ok but they too thick for my liking.,4
B07B9FD9H5,Seem to be good quality. Much lighter than khaki.,3
B07B9FD9H5,Lightweight and fit wonderfully. Not too thick and keep feet cool.,5
B07B9FD9H5,High quality and nice design patterns. These pair well with my work attire.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Muy bonitos le gustaron mucho a mi hijo,5
B07B9FD9H5,Excellent socks,5
B07B9FD9H5,"Can no longer find proper size socks in stores., I ordered size 10-13 fit really good.I don't know why the stores i shop in only sell size 6-12/what makes them think a 12 foot will fit a 6 sock.I am order only on line now and can get the proper size. would high recommend them.",5
B07B9FD9H5,Many of the cheap socks I use smell after full day work. But this does not and I am so glad. It's soft and moisture absorbing.,5
B07B9FD9H5,Comfortable stylish yet simple. Got them in the blue set and the black.,5
B07B9FD9H5,For years I wore Gold Toe dress socks. They are not what they used to be. So glad I found these. They are very comfortable and look good. They stay up but don't choke my lower leg.  Noyt sure how durable they are but that almost doesn't matter. So pleased.,5

B07B9FD9H5,The socks tear after a few months,4
B07B9FD9H5,"My 18-year old son loves these socks. Comfortable, stay ""up"", and nice designs. He wanted black socks that had a little something extra, and these fit the bill.",5
B07B9FD9H5,"Quality is great, and they wash very well. At first I was bothered by the brand name emblazoned on the bottom of the socks, but it actually helps you put them on straight!",5
B07B9FD9H5,"Comfortable socks made from a good material blend; moisture is fairly controlled; thin and useful for my applications; I'm skeptical about long-term durability; pleased with the product, and I would re-purchase if I get a couple of years of wear.",4
B07B9FD9H5,Really comfortable socks love the color ski and the elastic is great. They stay up all day.,5
B07B9FD9H5,I received one pair of argyle one pair of dotted and one pair of diamonds. I received five solid Navy socks.  The argyle pair is all threads on the inside.So I received five and a half pairs of socks. The Navy either have white stuff on the inside of them or have dots and white stuff on the inside of them. This is after I washed them.I already threw everything away because they thought they were decent socks so I can't return them. Very disappointed.They feel like cotton they're not like thin dress socks.  They look like they might be a little bit small too.  There for a friend of mine that has a size 11 and a half shoe and I bought the socks according to that.  I don't think that these socks will last long.  I don't think they'll be real warm but they are thicker than some dress socks are.,2
B07B9FD9H5,"Time will tell how long they will last, but they look just like the pictures and fit great.",5
B07B9FD9H5,They look nice and the quality is good but they size a little big.,4
B07B9FD9H5,My shoe size is 14-15. These socks are perfect for me. Very comfortable. I am a returning customer. Bought these four times in the past years.,5
B07B9FD9H5,"My son liked the variety of the designs. They are simply good dress socks! He wore them to a wedding and for school concerts, so he isn't wearing them every day. They do the trick and wash and wear nicely.",5
B07B9FD9H5,Warm and comfortable! Very soft!,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I am 5'10"" and 230 Lbs. With a 38"" waist, broad shoulders and chest. The XL vest fits really well. It zips up without fitting too tight, leaving room for thicker shirts to be worn underneath. It arrived on time and in perfectly new condition.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"The color was very nice, true to size and a great extra layer for a little more warmth without being thick and bulky.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Very comfortable. Perfect fit.,5

B01BUJ9YR4,Very lightweight comfortable and nice fit,4
B01BUJ9YR4,"Warm and comfortable. A little tight around my middle - I'm not carrying a baby, that's just fat. I think that this vest might be a little warmer than my hoodie, but I'm not sure. It's nice to have the arms free. This vest completes my cold weather gear. I am glad that I bought this vest instead of something battery-powered.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Great fit! Doesn't make that annoying ""nylon"" sound when brushing against things. Provides adequate warmth and is a great casual or work vest.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Super comfortable and very high quality. Adequate warmth on a sunny but chilly day.,4
B01BUJ9YR4,"I bought this for my husband, who wanted a new vest for this winter on our farm. He wears it all the time, loves the comfort and fit, and it's stood up to wear and tear both from farm work and from the fact that my husband is just a nightmare on clothing items. No tears, runs in the fabric, or issues, and he loves everything about it.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,This is stylish vest that offer warmth and comfort. High recommended.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Lightweight, but with a hoodie or sweatshirt underneath it is an awesome vest!  Easy to move around in!  Upper front pocket is a plus!  Just wish the side pockets had zippers instead of snaps!",5
B01BUJ9YR4,My husband love this,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"This is the second one I have purchased. Lightweight and warm. Can move around in it, very comfortable.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Very comfortable love the pocket space will have every color! Also great in the snow elements keeps you dry!,5
B01BUJ9YR4,It's great. It's car quality like all things Carhartt generally sides down one. Other than that it's super light. Very utilitarian. Looks great over a hoodie.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Runs a little big, my husband sized down. Thinner but still warm. Can be dressed up or down. My husband loved this as a Christmas gift.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Great quality but tight fit.,4
B01BUJ9YR4,Well made and looks great on my husband,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Husband wears this 1-2 times a week. He loves it and it is holding up great.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,My husband loves it,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Great vest,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Fits great and color is niceKept me warm in CO without being bulky,5
B01BUJ9YR4,High performance- yet light weight,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"It appears to be a well made product, but the vest size does not align with their shirts. Its about one size lower than ordered.",4
B01BUJ9YR4,The quality and color is what I like the most,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"All was good with this product: color, durability, wearability, zipper quality, size, & value for money!Would purchase again!",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Vest is great but like all carhartt items it runs big. Normally wear a XXl sweatshirt and ordered an XL tall and fits perfect.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"As Carhartt does, fits perfect and is great for weather accy. Best color!",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"This is a great jacket, and a 8/10 design but it's lacking in the most necessary feature. I ended up buying the 5.11 version instead because it was extremely lightweight, rolls up into a ball and yet probably 4x warmer. However, this jacket had the better pockets, and arguably I like the horizontal stitching look better. Make the arms have a nice sinch mechanism, and use the special insulation in the 5.11 jacket and I think you'll be on top. The neck fabric is a little rough. I'd prefer a Sherpa or maybe micro rabbit hair feel, but it's not a deal breaker. Also, keep the XLT sizing please, extra cost isn't an issue, for whatever reason all men's clothing is either for a 1950s man, or women these days and never fits right. The XLT is about the same length as the default 5.11 XL.",4
B01BUJ9YR4,"Super quick shipping, better price than any other website.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas. The vest fits nicely, except it kicks out at the bottom in the back when he wears it. (That's what I dislike the most.) Most of his problems with the vest involve the openings to the pockets which are hard for him to get into if there is anything in his hand to put into the pocket. I think the openings are a little small for a larger man. He says the fabric is a little slick!  (I fear all remarks are tainted by his previous vest, which he liked very much and left somewhere. Next year I will get him sticks!)",4
B01BUJ9YR4,GREAT!,5
B01BUJ9YR4,My husband loves this vest.  Nothing else to say.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Stylish lightweight vest, perfect for layering under a shell or heavier coat as it isn't bulky. With most things from this brand I'm a medium but their small jackets and vests fit me better. The long tail keeps the wind from going up your back, the high collar keeps it from blowing down your neck. Oh - and it has FIVE pockets, two secured with zippers so your cellphone and wallet are kept on your person, the other pockets have a snap to keep them loosely closed. Great vest, and Carhartt steps up their wear into something stylish and for the hiker or trekker.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Nice light vest.  A little pricey compared to some other similiar garments.  Sheds water a bit so far so good.  Not as warm as something heavier but still works.I have an older one, same size-XL tall, this is a little better (thicker fabric, softer collar) but maybe a size larger, an inch or so longer.  Weird but true, still seems like a good buy.  The older one is very well made, worn it cutting wood, doing some heavy duty stuff outside, it shows a little wear but not as much as it should.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I really like the vest, color and features but I have no chance to provide an objective review of the water resistance, durability or comfort since I ordered a Large and the seller sent a medium. I sent it back and I'm waiting to resolve the problem. I may order another after my account is credited.",4
B01BUJ9YR4,"I've had this vest for 12 months and it's a shambles. It has a tear, and all of the threads are loose, all the time. The stitching is poor. If this is today's Carhartt, buy something else. This vest is not durable enough for work use.",2
B01BUJ9YR4,"Purchased this item as a Christmas gift however it never arrived.  I finally reordered the vest, after Christmas, and it arrived promptly.  Seems like a decent vest.  Not really heavy.  My husband likes it so I guess that is good!",4
B01BUJ9YR4,I gifted this to my husband for Christmas and he practically wears it every day. He said it is water resistant on rainy days. My favorite thing about this was the availability. It was sold out on the Carhartt website. Amazon shipped it to me in 2 days and the price was the same!,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I wear this all the time. As the main layer or a complimentary one. Solid, warm, rain resistant.Great inner pocket for phone.Would prefer zippered side pockets as in my last one (lost in my travels) but these latest iterations have snaps. So that's the one drawback, as I am often in active mode when wearing this.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Got this on the tail end of winter and wore all spring. Good value, flattering, and comes in tall sizes which is a rare find for a vest.Label picks right off with a few snipped threads.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,I have pieces of carhartt clothing already so I was aware but the vest does run big of what I would consider traditional sizes. I wear a large T-shirt but ordered a medium vest and it fits great and looks good!,4
B01BUJ9YR4,Looks great and fits perfectly. Plenty of pockets. Definitely one of my favorites. Highly recommend,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"This is a great Carhartt vest.  It is a large and I am 6'1"" / 185 lbs and it fits just right over a sweatshirt.  Anyone bigger would probably need the XL.  Also it has pulls to tighten the bottom at waist to keep wind out.  Two zipper pockets - one on outside and one on inside.  Also velcro pocket on inside.Carhartt makes great clothing.  Almost everything I wear is from them.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"One thing about this vest it holds body heat, great for cold weather. It's very lightweight but yet durable.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,This is a very stylish and high-quality vest.,4
B01BUJ9YR4,"This was purchased as a gift for my son and he really likes it.  Being a person who never considered wearing a vest, I wasn't sure if he would like it, but I knew he didn't like bulky jackets.  He's been wearing it a lot and said he doesn't know why he never thought to get one.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Warm for the fall or spring season.  I wish it was made out of a light cotton fabric for comfort.  This is a VERY thin nylon fabric with a VERY light poly insulating fill.  No sparks or snags from anything or it WILL tear, so no hiking or campfires permitted.",4
B01BUJ9YR4,"Used for everyday wear when temp required just a little something extra over swestshirt. Liked the material and pocket features. Fit it to size, and had good coverage on sides and back. Highly recommend",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I bought a navy, large tall for my guy. He is 200 lbs. 6 ft tall. He loves it.He doesn't like the puffy jackets or vests, so this was a perfect find.He said it is thin, but nice and warm. It is made well and looks great.Hope this helps.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,I am a big fan of carhartt because of their quality and value. This vest is no different. It is a little pricy but I think it is worth it. I got large tall because I am 6-4 230# with a long torso.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Just what was wanted, a little something for Spring weather when down is not needed and might be bulky.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"This is a comfortable light-to-mid-weight vest.  I wear it around the house and also as an outer garment when the weather is cool/mild.  The price was too good to pass up. The vest is comfortable and seems to be well made. Wanted to buy another in a different color, but not available at the pricepoint of the black version.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Durable, fits well, comfortable and fairly water resistant.",4
B01BUJ9YR4,This is my second one. First one lasted a couple of years. Than the seams inside gave out. Hoping this one last longer.,4
B01BUJ9YR4,"This is one of 5 I bought.I have black, brown, gunmetal, green and Carhartt brown which is kinda orange rust.True to size and thin but they keep you warm when cold and cool when warm out",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Bought this for my husband, based on reviews, I ordered a medium. Wish I would have gotten him a large, he would have preferred it to.Looks nice and well made.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Great vest to wear on chilly days! Easy to stuff in a day pack. Very light but very warm, also helps keep the wind out!  I got a small coffee stain on it that won't come out, but that seems to be very common with any of the polyester/puffy jackets or vests that I've always had. Seems to be an issue with the nylon shell; doesn't matter what brand, color, or item.  Make certain if you consider yourself a tall person that you order the tall sizes. The first one I ordered what is regular size and it was a little too short, had to return it for a tall and it fits much better. This is a 40 to 60 degree Fahrenheit vest. You will have to layer if it is colder or get a thicker vest or jacket. Another great piece of clothing from Carhartt!",4
B01BUJ9YR4,"I really like the moss color it is very nice and clean look. When I bought I wanted something a little tighter, so I bought a Large size and I'm 6'3 180lbs. It is very light weight it is mostly raining days and cool nights. Overall I would buy again",5
B01BUJ9YR4,My husband is usually a large. I got him a large tall and it was still snug when zipped up. I recommend sizing up for a more comfortable fit.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Comfortable with LOTS of Zipper Pockets I love it,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"The material is high-quality and the stitching is great. I love the color and fabric. The length, top to bottom, is bizarre. The back is fine but the front is way too short. Comically short. The bottom hem in the back of the vest rests right below the top of my back pants pockets. The bottom hem of the front of this vest, though, falls right at the middle of my belly button. So weird! Fits like a woman's baby-doll tee. Sending it back.",3
B01BUJ9YR4,"This was perfect for my husband for his daily commute - not too hot, but keeps his core warm. Def would buy again.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I actually like that this is a lightweight vest with very little bulk to it. But, it isn't what I was expecting it to be. It will be good for spring, summer and early Fall but I was expecting it to be a bit heavier.  It doesn't have the traditional ""heft"" of a Carhartt product. Which is positive and negative. The positive is that even my wife has said ""I really like the cut of that. It's really nice."" Typically anything I buy Carhartt she thinks makes me look like a construction worker. This vest could easily have a Columbia, REI or Patagonia logo on it and nobody would think twice. The negative is that it is light and I question if it will hold up as well as the typical Carhartt products and their heavy, durable weight. Time will tell. But, I really like it anyway.",4
B01BUJ9YR4,"I read a prior review that sizing ran large. I normally would buy a large, but because of that review I first bought a medium. It was too tight in the abdomen and waist. I returned it and replaced it with a large, and it was perfect. So I recommend just buying your normal size. I bought it in black, like it so much I ordered another in blue.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,True to size,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"Couldn't be happier with the vest, it's exactly as as described and the ""relaxed fit"" made it work for me 6'1"" 335. Just the right weight for our cool mornings and evening in NorCal but probably not heavy enough if you're working in the cold and all the pockets are the best, good product.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Looks great feels great lightweight very warm. Nice pockets my cell phone pocket five stars.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Great quality and fit! My husband has a few of them!,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Quality product that fits great as an outer layer that provides comfort and resistance to the elements.  You get what you pay for with the Carhartt brand and definitely worth every dollar.,5
B01BUJ9YR4,Nice fitLight weight & warm,5
B01BUJ9YR4,"My husband wanted a lighter weight vest for fishing so he didn't have to wear his Cinch vest.  This is a perfect lighweight, yet warm vest for every day wear.  The thickness is comfy for walking or working in the yard on the slightly cooler days.  Since he is picky about his clothes being a big man ( 6'4"") and thick around the middle.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for the ideal midweight vest.  He loves it.",5
B01BUJ9YR4,"I wore this throughout the fall and spring, and even during the winter under a waterproof shell a few times. I have zero complaints. It fits well and keeps me warm enough without making me sweat. It's nice enough that it doesn't look out of place worn over a button up shirt, but it's tough enough to split wood on the weekends without me worrying about destroying it either. Great vest!",5
B01BUJ9YR4,Handy to grab for short trips,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Very nice, soft materials.  Well made. True to size, so no need to worry about shrinkage.  Long enough.  Great price.",5
B06XCQSPKL,So far no issues. Fabric is good quality. They seem a little flat across the front- but fit decently. Love the open legs because I hate sweatpants that are gathered. Comfortable and seem to be built ok to last.,4
B06XCQSPKL,These run a little big but I bought many of these for myself and son.  I like they don't have a tight leg and especially they have a loose ankle fit.,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Too long, too thin, to much hassle to return. Don't bother with this particular item. I recommend paying a little more for a better-made brand and getting something that actually fits. I have never purchased a garment like this that was a full six inches too long in the leg. Ridiculous!!",3
B06XCQSPKL,"I ordered a few of this sweatpants because they are perfect for a person with limited mobility since the bottom is not tight and 5he waist is comfortable to take up or down, also the fabric is very comfortable to walk around even  in summer or winter",5
B06XCQSPKL,I needed something comfortable and easy to pull on after surgery.  These were perfect.  I have long legs and appreciate the extra length.  I do wish the pockets were bigger and had some type of closure.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"XL for husband showed winter-weight what is now called flannel (not the soft kind), so I purchased L for me (5 eleven, 140 lb). Worked well. Shrunk in length a bit in cold water washing, air drying on first wash. Glad I purchased. Has soft inner lining, much appreciated.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"I ordered these in a Large for my husband. He tried them on when they arrived and said they fit perfect, well then he washed them. They did shrink and now they are mine. I just ordered him an XL to try.",4
B06XCQSPKL,Like it,4
B06XCQSPKL,I love Hanes my go to brand.I don't remember why I was going to return them but I gave them to my daughter. 2 pair.,4
B06XCQSPKL,We can purchase these thru Amazon and have them shipped to us. No need to travel 20 miles in the bad weather to purchase them.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"As described. Dad hates the elastic closure for the legs typical sweat pants come in. This was a nice open, like a standard pant leg. They look and feel good. Great price! Will be purchasing other colors. Ppl did state they come in larger so i ordered down and tht was a great fit.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"I am 180 pounds 5 foot 11, male, and I ordered the large size. I had to take these in/up about three inches in the cuffs because they were too long. They fit loosely on me which is exactly what I wanted in sweatpants. They are very comfortable and they seem to be good quality.",4
B06XCQSPKL,"I use these for use in my Woodworking shop, so the value is good. They do have rather short pockets and the draw string is one continuous piece. I cut mine and flame the ends so they don't fray. The elastic seems sufficient, although I'm not sure how long it will remain that way. The legs are way over length.",4
B06XCQSPKL,"Hanes has a great product here.  They are made well, comfortable to wear and hold up well.  My son wears them doing freight for UPS and they hang in there.",5
B06XCQSPKL,Super comfortable pants and at an awesome price point but I was surprised at how thin these were! They're great to wear around the house but I don't think they would keep you warm outside.,4
B06XCQSPKL,Very nice fit except a bit too long.,4
B06XCQSPKL,Very soft. Size is what I expected. They are a little thinner than I thought they would be but that's good as they will work perfectly for the Spring and Summer.,5
B06XCQSPKL,These are nice weight sweats and work well for winter in the southern states.  One star taken off for the excessive length of legs.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"I bought my husband (who doesn't like clothes), a grey pair and also a black pair.  they fit perfectly and are very comfortable.  I assume he likes them since he wears them every week, washes them, and wears again!",5
B06XCQSPKL,"As advertised, nice material, good fit (use their fitting chart, it seems accurate to me). The only drawback is no draw string to be found but I do not believe that they advertised one so that's my bad since I overlooked it, but it would really help especially in the mornings when you're stumbling out of bed and want to put your phone in your pocket without it pulling them down to the floor.",4
B06XCQSPKL,ample fitheavy weightlove the pockets that some sweats are leaving off now.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"I normally wear an XL but had to return these for a L because the waist was too big. I bought these because I do not like the gathered cuffs on most sweatpants. I deducted 1 star because they are not as heavily fleece lined as I like, but otherwise they are fine.",4
B06XCQSPKL,Size was as expected.  Very durable product and comfortable to wear.  Color did fade at all either,5
B06XCQSPKL,Love them except they ran longer than description indicated.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"Bought these for my father who is always cold, but I wanted to make sure he could be comfortable while he works. I got them on sale, but would pay full price for them. Warm, cozy, and can be used in most situations. Would definitely wear them to play sports, hang around the house, or go to the mall. Great product for the price and would buy them again!",5
B06XCQSPKL,A little long for my husband however since he wears in the house only I did a quick hem and they work well for lounging. He loves the warmth and softness.  Hint:  A lot of lint on 1st wash.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"I sent these to my son who is stationed in wet dreary England and he, who NEVER hardy comments on clothes, unsolicited sent me back a message that said"" these sweats are to die for"". Yea! Put one up in the win column for Mom!  Knowing him, who doesn't like to change outfits, I feel he finds them warm and cozy, suitable for the apt, dog walks as well as the neighborhood pub.  (I'm just the Mom, that's all I can tell you...)",5
B06XCQSPKL,"So soft, great fit, and so so comfortable.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"My son 6' 2"", 200lbs, needed the XL and it fits great.  The legs go all the way down so his ankles aren't showing.  It looks like that heavy sweatshirt material but it is lighter.  He wears them in 7 degree weather but he is also 23.",5
B06XCQSPKL,Comfotable...love to lounge around in these,5
B06XCQSPKL,Perfect.,4
B06XCQSPKL,Apollo smelled awful bad smell,5

B06XCQSPKL,Great quality,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Got my husband a L in the pants and zip up for a Halloween costume, but we had to skip the pants portion because they ended up being on the high end of XL, really. They were soft and comfortable, as expected, but one star off for the vast sizing discrepancy.",4
B06XCQSPKL,Pretty good. right length and easy to wear.,4
B06XCQSPKL,There nice. They work.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"The drawstring slips out of a knot tied in it, needs elastic in the waistband.",4
B06XCQSPKL,Bought for husband since it became cold in FL. He wears a 38 in pants and these fit well.,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Material and fit is good - comfortable. Price is good value, so I ordered 3 more of these to the total of 4 pants.",4
B06XCQSPKL,"Did not like they how they fit, inseam is to long. Material is comfortable and soft.",4
B06XCQSPKL,Enough leg room goes over my sneakers well nice soft,4
B06XCQSPKL,"Bought a size up to make sure I had room, and they're perfect and cozy. Definitely buying a second pair!",5
B06XCQSPKL,"Well worth what I paid and a great value through Amazon. They are ok for around the house inside or sleeping. I have purchased many of these exact sweats in different colors, but I do wait until they go on sale. With amazons' sale prices they are a great value. They get those ""pills"" on them after only a few washes and they lose their elasticity quickly but at this sale price they are kind of disposable. I save them for when we go on vacation to wear around the condo. I do recommend these but not at the full retail price. They go on sale all the time. Not just here but even in the local stores. They always seem to be on sale.",4
B06XCQSPKL,"These pants are nice fluffy smooth and good to walk with. Only faults lie with riding on bikes as they tend to slip a bit from the waist. Gray is a fine color and it's slightly warm, not the warmest pants you could get for fall weather, much less winter. Washing it will not leave it unmarked as bunches of fabric on the pants fuzz up on the crotch area so be careful on taking care of the clothes so it won't tear up there.",4
B06XCQSPKL,These sweatpants fit well. I like my clothes to be roomy and these don't disappoint. The weight is good as well. Not thin & cheap feeling. The drawstring is hefty and won't break. I like the open bottom on the legs. No elastic to get stuck up past my ankle or to constrict my legs. There's a fair number of colors to choose from which is great too.,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Good quality, my pair seems to run a little big  in the waist for the size I order.",4
B06XCQSPKL,"I'm 6'1"", 180# and usually need to find ""tall"" pants for my 34"" inseam. Unfortunately, this sometimes means the clothes will also be for ""big"" men as well and will fit too big overall. These fit me perfect. Plenty of length, the legs fit loose and the fabric is thin which is exactly what I wanted. I like the open ankles and the tie at the waist. I will mainly be wearing these around the house so I didn't want anything that would be too warm and bulky. Bottom line, I like these and the price.",5
B06XCQSPKL,Product good and as advertised.,5
B06XCQSPKL,Run a little large. Order a size smaller than you usually wear.,4
B06XCQSPKL,Warm and soft. Bought as a gift. They like them!,5
B06XCQSPKL,I like lounging around the winter time with sweatpants on. These things are very light and very roomy. They're quite comfortable. They have a elastic waistband and a drawstring. Good stuff,5
B06XCQSPKL,Very soft and warm. True to size,5
B06XCQSPKL,"I like the fabric and the XL fits well in the waist (42 in waistline). The problem is they are too long. I washed and dried it in hot water, which helped a bit but still too long. I am 5'10' and have a 32 inseam.",4
B06XCQSPKL,"For men of a certain age and physical condition *cough* these are perfect, no kidding. Lots of room and forgiving material. I will buy more.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"Great value. Warm, fit well, durable.",5
B06XCQSPKL,These run big!,5
B06XCQSPKL,Fit well and comfortable,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Great quality, awesome fit . Deep enough pockets , very comfortable.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"My husband loves the softness of these pants. They are true to size, great material that keeps him warm.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"They make these very long and without elastic on the legs. I think you are supposed to roll them up depending on your height. I would rather have them with elastic foot/legs holes like they show in the pictures. They are also pretty baggy. I know sweatpants are not a fashionable item, but walking around my house I feel like a gangsta rapper. I would buy another pair of something else if I could go back and do it over.",3
B06XCQSPKL,"I bought the Hanes ComfortSoft EcoSmart Men's Fleece Sweatpants, which are well-made but tend to be oversized. My husband, with a 47-inch waist and 44-inch hips, found the 2X size a bit too roomy around the waist, and the drawstring was excessively long. While he can wear them, a shorter drawstring would provide a better fit. He appreciates the open bottoms and the pockets, which are definitely a bonus, but a smaller size might have offered a better fit. Although he usually wears a 2X in pants, these were loose yet comfortable.",4
B06XCQSPKL,Fit OKShed dreadfully,4
B06XCQSPKL,Nice quality too big. I just got the wrong size gonna try again.,4
B06XCQSPKL,"They are size accurate, comfy and feel well made.",5
B06XCQSPKL,runs very large,4
B06XCQSPKL,fit well,5
B06XCQSPKL,The only fault with this item is you can only buy one length.,4
B06XCQSPKL,These are inexpensive sweatpants but always do the job.  Most important for me is that they have a tight Band to keep them up and not just a string.  I own several in different colors.,4
B06XCQSPKL,price,5
B06XCQSPKL,Quality,5
B06XCQSPKL,"For the price, they fit my husband perfectly and are super soft",4
B06XCQSPKL,IT was just what I wanted,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Had a surgery that left one arm a bit less than usable and these pants, with the elastic waistband have made getting dressed one-handed much, much easier.  They are soft and comfy and look nice.",5
B06XCQSPKL,"Great value for the money, good durability, warm, many colors and sizes",5
B06XCQSPKL,Soft warm and comfortable,5
B06XCQSPKL,I was so happy these were a really comfortable easy fit for my s.o. The size is true and the cut is pretty great.,5
B06XCQSPKL,Really like the fit and great material.,5
B06XCQSPKL,Bought for a gift,5
B06XCQSPKL,"Fits good,the pockets are good.easy to wash",5
B06XCQSPKL,"These pants are exactly as described. Roomy, medium weight, my only dislike is the pockets are so shallow/small... I rate them a 4.5 Star only because of the pockets...",4
B06XCQSPKL,These sweatpants are great.  Look good and the fit is just fine.  Price was right.  A good value and very comfortable.,5
B0BV241H3F,"I absolutely loved this shirt! The COOFANDY Men's Linen Short Sleeve Casual Shirt is the perfect choice for beach weddings and a variety of everyday occasions. Its lightweight and breathable fabric keeps you comfortable even in warm weather. Made from high-quality linen, this shirt not only looks fresh and stylish but also resists wrinkles, making it an excellent option for travel or long days out. The casual fit allows for easy movement, while the short sleeves offer a relaxed vibe that is perfect for summer outings. Overall, it's a versatile addition to any wardrobe! In fact, I got it in different colors.",5
B0BV241H3F,"Wearing a light colored shirt out to dinner while on vacation is a bit risky. Is there a good chance I manage to not get wine or food or dessert on it? Yes. Is there a good chance I get one or possibly all three on it? Also yes. So it's important to look good without being too pricey and ideally with the ability to withstand how I am. This shirt hits all of those points.Now, this is not a fully linen shirt, it's a linen blend that has the appearance of linen. For me, this is perfect because it means most things will wash out if they don't set, it's got a little bit of flex to it, and it doesn't wrinkle quite as easily or severely as linen. The fit is an athletic cut, which is what I was looking for. I'm 5' 10"" 192 lbs, medium frame, but bigger in the shoulders, 33 waist and the Medium was perfect. If you're a larger frame, go larger because the arms were a bit tight.I have it in white and blue. They were purchased for vacation/beach wear, but I think they may join the spring/supper rotation next year. Definitely a great value for what you get. I've purchased other items in the past from this brand and I've yet to be disappointed. The ""linen"" pants that match these shirts are also highly recommended for all of the same reasons, if you need to complete the look.",5
B0BV241H3F,"I seldom purchase clothes online due to numerous past disappointments. However, I decided to give this shirt a try, and to my surprise, it's a great fit, comfortable, and I believe it looks good on me. Encouraged by this, I ordered three more in different colors. I chose size XX Large, and they fit perfectly. As someone who usually wears t-shirts and jeans, I appreciate the shirt's simple design and solid color. The fabric is lightweight, which is ideal for Florida's summer heat. After about eight washes, I'm writing this review, and I'm pleased to report that the shirts have neither lost any buttons nor have any loose threads, which speaks well for their quality and consistency, especially since all four shirts have held up well in the wash and dryer without any problems.",5
B0BV241H3F,"I love the way this shirt looks with the hidden buttons and texture of material on my husband; however, the first wash and dry caused a thread to pull. Too soon!!",3
B0BV241H3F,"I was worried about the fit for my husband but they fit perfectly. Air dry the shirts, they were pretty good about wrinkling, you just have to fix the cuff on the sleeve before hanging to dry.",4
B0BV241H3F,Love it,4
B0BV241H3F,Was what I expected,4
B0BV241H3F,My husband bought this for a stay at a resort. It was his beach shirt that also doubled as an outing shirt. He loved wearing it and it kept him cool and comfortable.,5
B0BV241H3F,"Husband/ loves the fit, very comfy nice to wear on an evening out",4
B0BV241H3F,Nice casual comfortable shirt. Arrived just as expected. No worries.,4
B0BV241H3F,"Todavia no las use, pero con seguridad seran unas de la prendas preferidas",4
B0BV241H3F,A lot of loose buttons,4
B0BV241H3F,Bought this for vacation in the D.R.. Super comfy shirt. Size is spot on. Plan on buying two.or three more for our trip.,5
B0BV241H3F,These shirts are amazing. Purchasing for a trip to Egypt in April and will be comfortable and fabric that will breath will make the visit enjoyable.,5
B0BV241H3F,"Comfortable shirt, fit was perfect.  The way it was shipped----in clear package with shipping label slapped on plastic.  Not happy with the way it was shipped",5
B0BV241H3F,"Vibrant colors, soft and comfortable, true to size.",5
B0BV241H3F,quality is great.  runs large.,5
B0BV241H3F,Shirt fits well and is very comfortable. I will order a few more.,4
B0BV241H3F,Needed a nice purple shirt for a wedding to wear under a suit coat this one fit the Bill and it was very comfortable to wear,4
B0BV241H3F,Feels like quality material and fits correctly. Haven't washed it yet but it is stylish and looks great.,4
B0BV241H3F,this was a 2 shirt order...1 came from vietnam and was wrapped nicely and fit perfectly.....this one..strangely did not come from vietnam..it came from china...it was terribly creased out of the package and took my wife 15 minutes to carefully iron it....so...not happy with the new condition of this shirt...,5
B0BV241H3F,"I would add one star if Ihad received a new, unused shirt.  I've ordered a total of 4.  The first was new, but was a full size larger than I woud expect based on usual sizing.  I returned it and got a replacement, one size smaller that was satisfactory.  I liked it enough to order two more.One of the two (in the same order) was fine, came packed with a cardboard backer, tags and was enclosed in a branded plastic bag.  The other was bunched into a small unbranded plastic bag, unfolded and heavily wrinkled. It was also missing one button on the front.  Obviously a return that was sold as new.",3
B0BV241H3F,"I haven't yet washed the shirt, but first try-on looks very good.  Waiting for Summer :)",5
B0BV241H3F,great,5
B0BV241H3F,Ordered in my size to tight  but good shirt,5
B0BV241H3F,Me gusta esa camisa,5
B0BV241H3F,These shirts are perfect for my husband. They look amazing. They are cool and light but well constructed. Easy wash no shrinkage. Price matchesvalue.,5
B0BV241H3F,i'm a wide chested fellow and the xl fits nice,5
B0BV241H3F,Look and quality looking for a special event,5
B0BV241H3F,"Great Linen shirt no button show, very clean cut. It was a gift for my son and he has raved about it.",5
B0BV241H3F,I liked for a all black occasion for the holidays I will be dressed for any occasion during the holidays,4
B0BV241H3F,"I'm quite happy with this shirt (and ordered two more) but have a couple of issues to report:1. The shirt started out in the factory neatly folded but packing and shipping came full of creases that needed touch up with a hot iron to go away. After the touch up, now a wash in cool water, a few minutes in the dryer and hanging up to finish drying is all that is needed. So I'm happy ...2. Three of the buttons have come off in the last week and had to be sewn back on. Not so happy about this. I'm hoping my two other shirts, that have arrived, don't have the same problem.",4
B0BV241H3F,"Shirt is really nice but the small is bigger than what a small usually is. My husband always wears smalls, but it fit him like a medium!",4
B0BV241H3F,Great looking shirt quality is superb  fits as expected,5
B0BV241H3F,Described as pictured... Very nice quality and feels comfortable.  IMO. well worth the price.,5
B0BV241H3F,I love this what lightweight shirts. Great for the summertime in Florida.,5
B0BV241H3F,Product was as described digitally,5
B0BV241H3F,Beautiful shirt!  Good fit.,5
B0BV241H3F,"Nice shirt, but it could use a pocket.",5
B0BV241H3F,Came quickly. Fits well . Good material,5
B0BV241H3F,"The material and design are very attract. If you go with a ""standard"" size chart, as opposed to the one shown here ,you should be okay. I'm usually on the border of L and XL and the L fit okay. The cuffs look great in the ad. However, with the first wash, the crease came out a bit limp and uneven. The description does classify them as adjustable, but I don't they'll hold outside of the original crease. On the other hand, after one wash, some of the creases created by folding for packing/shipment remain to some extent. All in all, it's a good shirt for the price.",3
B0BV241H3F,Shirt fit perfect,5
B0BV241H3F,Love the color and the fabric is nice enough - ordered a xxl but its still a bit too tight in the girth...need to lose weight.,4
B0BV241H3F,"Only problem I had was the top bottom loop was sewed shut. Other that that nice shirt, nice fit. Happy with the purchase.",5
B0BV241H3F,really nice shirt,5
B0BV241H3F,Great style.  GREAT FABRIC  !!!!,5
B0BV241H3F,"Fits really good,",5
B0BV241H3F,"Exactly as expected, it is a great shirt",5
B0BV241H3F,I loved the style.,5
B0BV241H3F,Fabric is a little thick and has no stretch but super cute,4
B0BV241H3F,This shirt is very comfy. The material is great and it is breathable. The fit is true to size,5
B0BV241H3F,Perfect fit and nice quality fabric,4
B0BV241H3F,"I bought this for my husband. The size, and color is outstanding. I will definitely order again from this seller.",5
B0BV241H3F,"This shirt looks very nice. The fabric is not stretchy, but if it's good.My husband is 5.11 and weights 175 and normally wears a size medium, so we bought a medium and it fit perfect .",5
B0BV241H3F,Todo ok igual a la foto,5
B0BV241H3F,I wish it came with a pocket. Good looking shirt,4
B0BV241H3F,"Nice quality, good value",5
B0BV241H3F,Bought for my husband for family photos in the beach. Looked very nice and he got lots of compliments!,5
B0BV241H3F,My husband loved the shirt. And fit loose and Chloe and is a great going up shirt.,5
B0BV241H3F,I bought this shirt for a Christmas present for my brother. It fits well and looks great.,5
B0BV241H3F,"This was one of my Christmas presents for my grandson, he really likes it.",5
B0BV241H3F,Good quality.  Looks great!  Maybe runs just a little on the small side.,4
B0BV241H3F,It was a gift. It fits perfectly and he loved it.,5
B0BV241H3F,Hermosa camisa y de buena calidad,5
B0BV241H3F,Fits well and looks good on him,4
B0BV241H3F,"This shirt is perfect for that dressy casual look where you want to wear it on the outside of your pants, so it's not too long.",5
B0BV241H3F,"I really liked this shirt but I returned it because it was a little tight across the shoulders and belly. It looked good, it wasn't visibly too tight but it just felt a little restricting and I was going for the ease and mobility. I am 5'11 and 230 lbs.",4
B0BV241H3F,Just loved the fit and feel of the material,5
B0BV241H3F,Bought for a Mexico vacation. My husband usually wears XL shirts. This was very boxy and unflattering. I returned.,3
B0BV241H3F,"Slim fit, great quality, lightweight and comfortable - definitely worth getting",5
B0BV241H3F,"Love this shirt, feels nice when on and looks great with jeans or pants light weight too",5
B0BV241H3F,It's a good fit; it washes well and I hope to have it for a long time. The only negative for me is that the 'invisible' buttons take me longer to put on and take off.,4
B0BV241H3F,Looks great on him,5
B0BV241H3F,"Looks great,feels great,too small. Size Guide say's 44 in chest.No ,41 in maybe.Will return and get next size up.",4
B0BV241H3F,"While it is a good-looking shirt, the rayon content can make it very hot for a summer day. It is wrinkle resistant, which linen is very much not. We like the look of wrinkled linen, rather than the artificiality of this blend. Much like the ""Bamboo"" fabrics, this shirt is just another rayon product, only with a bit of linen to lure you into buying it!",4
B0BV241H3F,"theses are nice shirts, amazon recommend large, they fit perfect for now, but one wash would have been too small, returned it. xl would have fit perfect.",4
B0BV241H3F,Good fabric and the shirt is a nice color is well made. I got a few nice compliments from women about it and what more can you ask from a shirt?,5
B0BV241H3F,"My boyfriend loves this shirt. Such a cute color. I ordered a Large, the material is not thick but not too thin breathable for Florida weather. Lol",5
B0BV241H3F,It is a nice shirt but it fits more loose in the waist than the pictures and it is also longer.Note also that despite the title of the item it contains only 30% linen (as stated in the descrption),3
B0BV241H3F,"Great shirt, I bought one Coofandy shirt, it was so comfortable and looks great, versatile, I liked it so much that I bought several more in different colors. Good quality and fair prices. And they look great especially the price.",4
B07S18XZT5,"THis coat is Heavy Duty and very well made. buy one and you are done.forever  Great pocket options and I feel very snug and warm in the coat.  I love that I can get this carhart in BLACK , so much nicer looking  Its lining is a soft wool blanket feeling and the outside is tough canvas ...",5
B07S18XZT5,"You can never go wrong with a carhart.Best quality they always fit true to size. You get warmth, rain proof and comfort. Sure you can find coats that look the same and may even cost less but nothing compares to a carhart! They are indestructible.  The only reason I purchased this one wasI was tired of seeing my husband in the same coat for twenty years.  Literally...LOL",5
B07S18XZT5,"The Carhartt brand always delivers on excellent quality. This jacket is stylish, warm and I like the fit. I live in Alaska, and I've been working outside almost daily, trying to finish renovating a shed before it snows. I have occasionally needed to take this off in 30-40 degree Fahrenheit temps because I get so warm. I love how deep the side pockets are, and the inside pockets are perfect for stowing my phone so it doesn't get damaged or full of sawdust. I look forward to wearing this jacket for years to come.",5
B07S18XZT5,"The jacket fit perfectly. The arms were a little long, but not a problem. The quality is very high as it is with all Carhartt products I own. Carhartt Men's Relaxed Fit Duck Blanket Lined Detroit Jacket seems to always stay in style. I am 6' and 180 pounds and ordered a large and it fits great and has a lot of room to move.I highly recommend this Detroit- style jacket!",5
B07S18XZT5,"This jacket fit in every way except the arms are too long, when I put it on you could only see my finger tips.I have worn a 2xl tall most of my adult life and never had a problem with fit until this jacket.It seems like a nice jacket other than the long arm length.",4
B07S18XZT5,I ordered the wrong size jacket.  They let me exchange for the correct size and I received the replacement jacket in less that 24 hours.  Top notch service. Very well made jacket. Thank you.,5
B07S18XZT5,"When I tried it on after delivery, I was disappointed by 2 things...The sleeves are really long. I wear a 34"" sleeve and these were probably 2"" longer than my max comfortable length. The stiffness of the material made the buttoned sleeve feel like it was pushing on my hands when at my sides. Slightly uncomfortable. If I kept the jacket, I would have had the sleeve altered. I suppose this may be a ""feature"" for those that extend their arms when working, it just wasn't for me.Also, the arm holes seem a bit high (aka narrow, as in how a suit fits) making it feel like there wasn't much room in the underarms for anything thicker than a long sleeve T.What I loved. The material is thick giving  the impression of long lasting durability. The insulation was decent for late Fall weather in Michigan. Its lining is thicker than the Re-engineered Rugged Flex version of this jacket and extends down the arms. I also appreciate the weather flap behind the zipper. All of this spells quality to me. The bi-swing back is great, no constriction when reaching forward or up with your arms. Great value but I just couldn't justify keeping it if I needed to have it altered.",4
B07S18XZT5,"The small fits me well. Has the snaps for a hood on the collar. Warm without being too hot for spring and fall, nice to layer under in the winter. Comfortable to drive in. The back gussets really do work great range of motion in this jacket.",5
B07S18XZT5,"Does your boyfriend always insist on wearing his work coat to events and places that are not work? Give yourself the gift of this jacket, in black. No staining, warm to his specifications and the collar/ relaxed fit with a pair of boots and jeans is perfect. I was not impressed with the presentation/ packaging of the jacket for the price, mine might have gotten beat around in transit but I would have preferred it be shipped in a box for the price. Great jacket, only lost a star for the packaging issues!",4
B07S18XZT5,My favorite jacket of all time.,5
B07S18XZT5,Perfect fit,5
B07S18XZT5,Good,5
B07S18XZT5,My son loves this coat and I would say that the quality is excellent,5
B07S18XZT5,"Great jacket with fit and function that is world class.  Material, stitching, lining and zippers are all top notch and ensure years of comfort.",5
B07S18XZT5,Bought for my boyfriend as a gift and he wears it everyday Coming from someone who used to only wear hoodies. Great quality & warm. Only downside is it attracts lint very easily.,5
B07S18XZT5,Fits good durable warmJust as advertised,5
B07S18XZT5,"Our 16 year old is obsessed with Interstellar and had to have this jacket. It fits well, is going to last so long and is warm. Love it",5
B07S18XZT5,Really like the fit and comfort of this jacket.,5
B07S18XZT5,A gift,5
B07S18XZT5,What else would a working man want. This is a great jacket,5
B07S18XZT5,Grandson loved it,5
B07S18XZT5,Heavy duty material. Great lining. Fit was perfect for size.,5
B07S18XZT5,"I'd never hard of Carhartt before in all of my 60 years. I wish I had, this is a rugged jacket that's plenty warm. I expect it will last a very many years. I washed and dried it per instructions (shipping wrinkles) and it's none the worse afterwards. I would purchase again.",5
B07S18XZT5,Very good material,5
B07S18XZT5,This jacket is warm and rugged.  Been in style forever.  Back on trend with college students,5
B07S18XZT5,Awesome Product,5
B07S18XZT5,Nice jacket very warm and comfortable love the blanket lining,5
B07S18XZT5,The coat is great and fits perfectly,5
B07S18XZT5,"Hi! Seller, this was a christmas gift but it didn't work and I can't see the return status. Please confirm ! Thank you so much!",3
B07S18XZT5,"I had a brown Relaxed Fit Duck Blanket Lined jacket that I loved and wore all the time. I finally had to retire it after 20+ years. This is a great replacement, the only difference with the old one and the new one that I liked better was the old one was a button down so I could button the middle ones while driving. Wish this had a bottom up zipper to accomplish the same feel while driving.",5
B07S18XZT5,Son in law loved it.,5
B07S18XZT5,fast delivery,5
B07S18XZT5,Satisfied with jacket,5
B07S18XZT5,".... i bought one of these last year with a hood in xxl but it was huge.so sent it back...  purchased this one in an xl and fits perf... im about 127 and 6' 3""....  material is a little stiff as expected but looking forward to breaking it in....",5
B07S18XZT5,"It's the classic Carhartt jacket and it performs just like all the others I've had, except the zipper is kinda difficult to get started.That may fix itself as I get a little more wear on it (or I just learn how to fiddle with it quicker).The Carhartt canvas work pants I oet fit and wear great. I expect the same from the jacket",5
B07S18XZT5,"Got this a young man's birthday gift, he absolutely loves it. The jacket is his all-time favorite and that is all he wears now.",5
B07S18XZT5,I bought this jacket for my son's 26th birthday upon his request. He wanted the black one. I got him a medium as that is what he normally wears and it was true to size. He loves it. It looks really sharp on him. Would definitely recommend.,5
B07S18XZT5,Very durable jacket keeps you warm great price would buy again,5
B07S18XZT5,My husband is obsessed with this jacket. It blocks all cold wind. He loves it,5
B07S18XZT5,This is my second jacket of  this style.  The jacket is a good fit and feel in the body.  The zipper seems to have smaller teeth and hard to find the end to start.  The sleeves are almost two inches longer than I would like or my previous jacket.,4
B07S18XZT5,Fits but not long enough.,3
B07S18XZT5,"I had used the old Detroit Jacket for work for a long time. After it fell apart I purchased this and people are right; its not the same quality. The zipper isn't the same thick brass one, the linear is softer but not has tough and not attached to the canvas like the old one, the adjustable buttons are gone from the hips area. The biggest thing is the canvas isn't as thick and I ended up tearing the sleeve on some fencing pretty easily. They have made some good improvements with the buttons to add a hood and the pockets are stitched in away that even they rip you wont lose anything.Despite this, I still believe this jacket is worth it. I ended up waxing the canvas which has made nearly bullet proof for rips and tears now. Hopefully they will listen to the customers and fix these issues in the future. The thick duck canvas is the biggest thing they need to bring back.",3
B07S18XZT5,In the return and replace cycle. Zipper will not work.  The zipper looks like a cheaper version of what was on my older Carhartt jacket. Is Carhartt going downhill on quality?,3
B07S18XZT5,"I bought this jacket to replace one that was worn out.  I also bought the optional hood, though I wish the jacket came with a hood.  The jacket is very warm and I like the trim fit.  It is sized to accommodate a layer or two, but still is not huge on me.  I like the lining, pockets, etc.  I am not impressed by the zipper, however.  It works ok, but it is impossible to start it with gloves on, and the zipper does not appear to be as sturdy as the one on my previous Carhartt jacket, which was a heavier brass colored YKK zipper.  It may prove to be very durable, but a warm jacket with a failed zipper is really not much use.  Time will tell on that.  So far, I am very happy with this jacket and have worn it many times already.",5
B07S18XZT5,"It fits perfectly...  Although I placed my order fairly late in the day it arrived just after 12 noon the next day. I've been searching for this particular Jacket for a good while,  and when I saw it was back in stock, I snatched it up immediately. (paying no attention to the fact that it's the summer season).  I'm Very happy with the Jacket and the transaction. 5/5 stars",5
B07S18XZT5,feels a bit stiff at first but it's meant to last,5
B07S18XZT5,Nice! jacket fits well and looks good !!,5
B07S18XZT5,Authentic item. Very nicely packed.Will serve me for many years.,5
B07S18XZT5,"Another great Carhartt product. I'm surprised I haven't found this sooner, given how much of their clothing I wear. This is about as heavy of a jacket I would wear, plus a hoodie, and I'm good to go in Minnesota. I keeps out the wind very well. I don't like heavily insulated ""puffy"" jackets. It fits snugly, has a good trim and fashionable look to it. The ability to add a separate hood is a bonus, I'd rather not be forced to have a hood at all times.Over all a great quality, tough jacket. Slim fit, yet still warm enough.",4
B07S18XZT5,I had one of these jackets years ago and it was one of the best jackets I ever owned. It got lost moving. I decided to buy a new one and went to a large because I normally wear a large shirt/sweat shirt. I got it and the sleeves were way too long and I felt like I was swimming in it.  Double check your sizing because I feel this jacket runs big.,5
B07S18XZT5,This is a great looking high quality jacket. The jacket has a cozy fit from a well known trusted brand.,5
B07S18XZT5,"I received my order today. The material is very heavy which will keep me warm. I ordered a small and upon opening my package, one of the sleeves had COBWEBS on it. The cobwebs caught me off guard, but the jacket itself still had tags on it. Overall, for the price, I would expect the item to be new and not with cobwebs.",3
B07S18XZT5,"I'm 6'2"" 215 lbs and I normally wear fitted size Large shirts. I initially bought an XL thinking it would fit like other non-Carhartt jackets I own, but it was too big. A large size fit me perfect - just like the model in the product picture with the body of the jacket falling at your belt line... that is, if you're not one of those interesting types that wear their pants above their belly buttons.If you need a jacket that is tough, heavy, and warm, while making you look awesome at the same time, then this jacket will do.",5
B07S18XZT5,"I read the reviews and was worried; I'm a carpenter and I've worn the Detroit jacket as my work coat for many many years.The short fit is perfect for wearing with your tool bags. And it's tough, and not too expensive.Since I work in the rainy state of Oregon I will wax my Carhartts, like a Filson. So it's always been about function over fashion for me.The changes: It's softer material, not as stiff.The blanket liner feels less like a horse blanket, more like a fleece blanket.The waist tightening buttons are gone.The insides of the pockets is softer, too.The outside chest pocket is bigger, good for my huge ass phone.There is an additional inside pocket, so two total inside pockets, one with a velcro tab, one with a full zipper.The main zipper feels less substantial, as it is a little bit smaller (the pull, and the ""zips""). This makes it harder to zip blind, I have to see it to guide the zipper around the material of the jacket. The old style the zipper stood out from the jacket more, now it's kind of buried in the material.The result of the changes is that it's less ""tough working jacket"" and more ""comfy lifestyle jacket"".It is definitely more comfortable. It feels a little bulkier than the old one, which was pretty thin and not what I considered a warm coat, more lightweight (but it qualifies as my main winter work coat here in the temperate coast).I bought the Navy color; it looks sharp.Time will tell if it is also a tough working jacket like it has been.",4
B07S18XZT5,Great motorcycle coat. My husband is very pleased with this product,5
B07S18XZT5,"Jacket was a present, perfect for cooler weather, he loves it.",5
B07S18XZT5,"Top quality, rugged jacket! Warm flannel lining. Made to last! I highly recommend this jacket.  Fair price and fast shipping!",5
B07S18XZT5,"Quality I've come expect. Very well made. Material, sewing, fit, liner all as good as most and superb for me. Priced competitively. Warm, resists wind, the collar really helps. I like this jacket as it has no hood. A coat that should last for many years. I have 30 years of carhart clothing wear time. I am a carhart fan because carhart is the best for me.",5
B07S18XZT5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The reason I took one star off is the workmanship. After wearing it in 2 weeks I found the lining at where cuff joins the sleeve  becomes exposed and this will not survive years of washing so have to return it.,4
B07S18XZT5,Love it,3
B07S18XZT5,"This is my third Carhartt jacket and second Detroit.  I liked that the last model had buttons to cinch the waist because these are pretty wide jackets.  Don't know why they added the extra length in the back area to cover your butt, either.  Anyways, the extra width gives you the ability to wear a sweater underneath at least.  These are lined with a nice insulating layer too.  Overall, it's still a great jacket.",4
B07S18XZT5,"I love Carhatt product, but these jackets are beyond heavy in a normal sense. You use it as military vest.",4
B07S18XZT5,This is my first Carhartt jacket I've' purchased so I have no views to offer for previous models. I purchased a medium black. I like the jacket for the durable exterior shell and free movement provided by the pleats at the back. There appears to be no insulation in the arms. The jacket feels heavy at 3lbs 2.4 oz. The sleeve length is a little long. I can fit my IPhone 12 mini in the front and inside pockets.,4
B07S18XZT5,Great jacket and great price. Fit is pretty accurate. Would order again.,5
B07S18XZT5,Decent jacket for the money. Zipper quality has declined over other carhartt products. Good car length jacket. Overall good product.,4
B07S18XZT5,Glad I found these for they are always sold out with the size I wanted. Felt comfortable and I know the jacket will last long. Provided the heat and it sure can resist wind when I took it for a motorcycle ride.,5
B07S18XZT5,"This is easily one of the most durable jackets I have ever owned (the other one is a Carhartt also). What else would you expect from a Carhartt? I will say though, that normally I wear an XL in shirts and jackets and originally ordered this one in XL, but it was WAY too large. I sent it back and ordered the Large size (that would normally be too small for anything else I've ordered) and it fit perfectly. Keep that in mind when ordering. If ever this jacket wears out (I seriously doubt that will happen) and need another jacket of this type, I wouldn't hesitate to order this one again.",5
B07S18XZT5,Description was vague,4
B07S18XZT5,My grandson loves it and he likes not having a hood,4
B07S18XZT5,Great jacket to work in the outdoors during winter.,5
B07S18XZT5,"I had been eyeing the Detroit jacket for a while. Decided to get it in black because I already had a few brown/khaki jackets. No regrets! The jacket fit snug(I usually wear shirts in XL, but know from past experience that Carhartt jackets run big), but got it in Large but it's not tight. If I lived in a colder climate, I would have gone with an XL so I could layer up underneath. The jacket is comfortable with a thermal or a thin hoodie underneath if needed, but it's warm enough on a cold winter night in Southern California as it is. I purchased an attachable hood for when I need it and it fits well(I wrote a separate review for that). From past experience with Carhart jackets. I know I'll have to wash them both together as the dye will fade and I want to keep the color matching as much a possible. Once my other brown jackets start to wear out, I'll definitely consider getting the brown Detroit jacket. I'm happy with my purchase!",5
B07S18XZT5,"Just got this jacket this morning, and I love it already - it feels substantial, without being stiff or restrictive. I normally wear a Medium jacket, but got the Large for more layering room, and it provides that, without being awkwardly roomy. Probably my new go-to outerwear. And it will last forever.",5
B07S18XZT5,"4xl Tall, torso is short and sleeves are extremely long.",3
B07LFYM6BZ,"Nice socks at a great price. Exactly what I was looking for. Fit well, extra thickness in the right areas to help with durability and a little compression support in the arch.  Very comfortable to wear but breathable for all day or athletic use. Highly recommend",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Socks are soft but not too thick. My husband wears a 12 and they fit good.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I have now bought 2 sets of these amazing socks. Anyone that works out or is on their feet for long periods of time need to purchase these socks. The pressure feature is amazing and they super comfortable! Exactly as described and more than worth the price.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I got these for a gift.  They absolutely love the fit and how good they feel..would certainly purchase again,5
B07LFYM6BZ,They are actually pretty comfortable and sized well.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Worn these for working out and golfing for the past year and am impressed.  Great fit, comfortable, inexpensive, and no visible wear and tear even after 12 months of wear.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Great socks at a great price !Comfortable and affordable absolutely nothing to complain about, would buy again.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,"I like them, however they seem to run small. If I were to order again, I'll order one size larger",4
B07LFYM6BZ,"Thick very durable socks. Look nice,  will definitely last.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,"I bought these socks for my grandson over a year ago and he liked them very much, but his feet have grown-again!-so he needed to move up to the next size. He was very happy to have great fitting and comfortable new socks.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,"they are thicker, stretch nicely. A little thicker style.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Really good product.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"I think I 've had these for 3 years now. They're very comfortable and are great for when you want low cut socks with shoes that would otherwise rub the back of your ankle too much. They look like they'll stick out when wearing them and have a weird sort of shelf in the back, but when wearing them, it's less emphasized.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,"The largest size is a little bit snug on a size 13 (US) foot, fyi. Otherwise good socks!",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Very comfy.  I wear a size 12 shoe and the S-M sock fits me fine.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,It is so hard to find socks that are extra large. Bought these for my husband for Christmas. He wears a size 14 shoe and finding socks for him is kinda hard in regular stores. He wanted new socks because his old ones kept slipping down into his shoe because they are to small. Very happy with this purchase and he has asked to get some more.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Socks were as was described.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Thick, decent - no issues after first wash/wear. Second wash, one has a hole lolol but das ight, dey cheap lmao",5
B07LFYM6BZ,As a cancer victim I need to have heavier than usual ankle socks that ride just above my ankles that will keep my feet warm but will not deter circulation to my feet as retention of fluids which can cause discomfort as well as having feet swell from chemo implementation.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Very nice ... like them,5
B07LFYM6BZ,excelent prodcut,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I love these socks! The cushioned bottoms feel very nice on hardwood floors. I will only be wearing these socks from now on!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Nice socks. Arrived quickly.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Super comfy socks,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Nice quality,extra cushion and style for the money.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Durable socks and good fit,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"the quality was good but the size was not a large as ordered....I wear a wide 10-1/2 and they were too tight, if you wear a smaller size they would be great (in large)......I gave the rest to one of my sons with smaller feet....",4
B07LFYM6BZ,Will try some others to see if I can find more padded and softer socks.,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Hubs says they are comfortable and true to size!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I have previously ordered these socks love them.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Love these socks. I don't itch. Comfortable. Second set I ordered and won't be the last!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Hubby thought these were the perfect size to fit his feet where a lot of socks are too small so the fit is great and they are also not too hot on his feet. Very soft color is true black,5
B07LFYM6BZ,come on time and just what i expected,5
B07LFYM6BZ,My grandson requested socks for Christmas.  He request was they fit his fit. He wanted heels.  These fit the request and he loved them. Immediately changed into these new socks.  Lots of smiles and thank yous.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Very comfortable and fit well. I definitely recommend them,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Comfortable and seem to be well made. Love the ankle height.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,socks are a need,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Quality is good,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I have bought this product several times prior and I will purchase then again. They have a good fit and they are very comfortable,5
B07LFYM6BZ,These are extremely cheap socks. Some reviews are saying they are thick and comfy but I completely disagree. I bought the XL size and it says XL on the sock but it feels like a medium-small. Maybe they mean XL in Asian sizes. The material is also very thin.With that being said if you are looking for cheap disposable socks or something casual to wear around the house in winter then these do the job.,4
B07LFYM6BZ,"Thick but not to thick.  Breathable, comfy, true to sizing, and great support.  I like them so much I'll be buying another set and getting rid of my other athletic socks.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Best fitting socks,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Great,5
B07LFYM6BZ,They are socks and they cover my feet.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I bought these just to use it at work since i walk for 10 hours so i needed this plus they're very confortable socks. I really love the support for my feet plus thickness was enough.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Great price on quality product. Thick socks  for the cool weather and com,fort for feet.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Very comfortable,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Socks fit,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Very soft and comfortable socks. I have big feet (11.5-12ish in womens) so I ordered the largest size and they fit well. I have not worked out in them yet so not sure how much feet support they offer but for everyday use they work fine.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"I read the reviews,  how awesome the socks are,  and I bought my first set two years ago and then another,  then I noticed that they came in 2 sizes I've been ordering the wrong size, I ordered xl and Bingo my feet feel great. Thicker and more comfortable",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Comfortable stays in place great for walking or running,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Golfed 27 holes in them with old shoes and the socks were the difference maker.  Must have for golfing,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Soft....what I expected,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I purchased these socks for my husbands size 13 foot and he is very pleased with them and states they are comfortable.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,The most comfortable socks I ever put on my feet by far!!! They don't cut into your ankle!!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Good quality comfort and design.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Used them for a stocking stuffer for my grandson that wears a size 12 shoe.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Gave these socks as a Christmas gift - and my boo-friend LOVES the plush quality fabric!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Got these as a stocking stuffer & they loved them!!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,The socks are great! Thick and durable,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I bought these for my husband because he loves this style of dock. Very durable and slip resistant with no shrinkage. Nice light weight sock.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,My husband says they're good and thick and great quality for the price,5
B07LFYM6BZ,These socks are so thick and soft and comfortable and a great price!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Great for the price. And I like the cushion on the back of the socks,5
B07LFYM6BZ,These socks are holding up well to washes.Very pleased,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"They are the perfect height and thicker than I was expecting, which is the primary reason for my 5 stars. My wife and family think no-see socks look best but I like a little of the sock to show. I would - I will - buy these again.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Highly recommended. Material keeps my feet warm during cold winter days. Prevents slipping on wooden floors. No wear and tear from machine wash.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Out of the box these socks are comfortable and cushioned. Obviously will not know durability until after a few months of wear and washings. Looking at the inside of the socks you do see 1/4 to 3/8 inch bushy threads sticking out. I assume where along the lines where material is sewn together. They are comfortable with shoes and I also used to walk a golf course, so a good test. Yes, perhaps a little warm but potentially no more heat retention than other socks that I had which were primarily cotton, unlike the material of these.But the main reason for this review is to help with sizing. The description indicates medium is for shoe size 6-12 and large is 13-16. Well my shoe size is a 11.5 Extra Wide. So I had no idea based on comments from others which size to choose. I ended up going with the large and glad I did. I believe the mediums would have been too small/tight for me. Having said that, these were a tad bit long so I tug them up slightly, but this size works fine for me.As of right now, prior to any washings and multiple wearings I can recommend. Time will tell on durability.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Great for price would buy again,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I liked that they fit well and had good support. Very durable and think. The colors are spot on.,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Best socks I've ever owned!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Good socks,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Just received them. Seem good,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Item is as described very comfortable,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Well made and comfortable.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,I love it,5
B07LFYM6BZ,LOVE HEM SO SOFT!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Good quality for the price.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"These are very comfortable, they have good support and are just the right amount of tight. And the back of the heel has extra padding for comfort too.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,Usually wear 14-15 and normal socks are somewhat tight from heel to toe. These give a very comfortable fit.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"I'm a size 12, so I ordered the small-medium, which is sizes 6-12.  These were too small.  I did get a size 13-16 afterward and these were good!  I'd order up to the next size if you're in between.",4
B07LFYM6BZ,"Well made, looks like they will last a long time.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,My son has large feet and finding quality in larger sizes is tough. These are very nice quality.,5
B07LFYM6BZ,He loves them,4
B07LFYM6BZ,My husband says his socks are comfortable and fit his big feet just right. He likes the arch support too,5
B07LFYM6BZ,"Have not worn yet, but arrived early, appear good quality and as expected.",5
B07LFYM6BZ,These socks are great and seem to hold up. P rice is a little high why I put in 4 stars .,4
B07LFYM6BZ,Fit perfect!,5
B07LFYM6BZ,Everything,5
B07HDLPVLH,Comfy and warm! These are great to wear around the house. The material is soft and thick. Good quality jogger and fit and flattering style.,5
B07HDLPVLH,"The midweight fabric is comfortable, and the waist/length are good. My only minor complaint is that the legs are baggier than I expected. That being said, I will probably buy another pair, as they are a good value for the price.",5
B07HDLPVLH,"Nice soft material and thicker than I thought. Reviews said this is too thin, not so. Not baggy at all butt a tad big. Washed it once before wearing and shrank just a little bit and ended up a perfect fit. I am 5' 11"" and 175 pounds. I bought a medium black. If they still fit the same after the second wash I will buy more. The waist will not slide down when bending over cause the waist band comes up to my belly button. The waist band is 2 1/4 inches wide, so I folded over one time for a waist fit. Good waist band. No need to thigh strings. Why not 5 stars? Because the cuff has no real elastic.  They use some kind of expandable material I do not believe it will stay tight for time to come. I could live with that.",4
B07HDLPVLH,"I bought a couple pairs of these pants for my adult son for Christmas. He absolutely loves the comfortable, soft fabric and the ease of the elastic waistband. The fabric is a little heavier than normal t-shirt fabric. They wash very well with little or no shrinkage. They are the perfect weight for lounging pants. He is 5'10"" with 33"" waist. Size medium was perfect.",5
B07HDLPVLH,"Good fit, good price, material is a little bit on the soft side and will wear fast but the price is good",5
B07HDLPVLH,comfortable and soft but baggy and too long. I was hoping the ankle parts would have elastic inside but they are too baggy. I chose 36 because that's my size but it had no choice of length. I have them rolled up to not step on them. Again I love how soft and comfortable the material is.,3
B07HDLPVLH,"The fit of the small was perfect (I'm 5'9"" 150 lbs) some may find it a bit small in the waist and for that a medium would be fine. The small leg length is also spot on, not too warm for inside but warm enough to go grab your mail in December. Very comfortable and I will order again",5
B07HDLPVLH,"I ordered a medium. They are giant. I ordered another light gray Hanes and they are more true to size. You can see in the photo these dark gray are so much longer than the medium light gray. They have an elastic waistband with a drawstring.  They have 2 deep side pockets along either side and a back pocket!  They run long.Update: I just washed and dried my husbands mediums, the inseam measures 32"" which is an inch longer than the size chart says. They are higher waisted too.  I did not measure before I washed them, so I am not sure how much they shrank, but they still are big, just not as big.",4
B07HDLPVLH,My teens love these comfy sweats. We even ordered another 2 pairs. Very functional and true to size. I do wish they came in different colors.,5
B07HDLPVLH,It actually looks good but it was only too big for me. Should have ordered large instead of extra large.,4
B07HDLPVLH,True to size. Nicely made. Washes and dries great!!,5
B07HDLPVLH,Super soft joggers. There is a pocket on the back that looks nice. Perfect for around the house!,5
B07HDLPVLH,Bought for husband. He loved them. True to size,5
B07HDLPVLH,Fits well,4
B07HDLPVLH,These sweatpants are light weight enough to wear around the house during cooler weather. I like the fact that they fit as advertised. They have a drawstring if you need to tighten them a bit around the waist. The pants are also made with elastic cuffs that keep them neat around your ankles. The only negatives at all are with the cotton/polyester blend the pants are a little baggy in the butt and the pockets are not deep enough to keep from pulling inside out when you remove something. I like them well enough thought that I bought three pair for daily wear.,4
B07HDLPVLH,"This was a gift for my husband and he loves them, very comfy and he loves this kind of cuff.",5
B07HDLPVLH,"For $14, these are a really good value. Very comfortable and even though they're thinner than I expected, they do a great job of keeping warm. I'm going to order another pair in a different color.",5
B07HDLPVLH,"I ordered a gray one for my husband, he liked that the material is soft, not too thick or thin.Warm, true to size.",5
B07HDLPVLH,1st impression is that it can keeps you warm inside home but it cannot last long outside winter killer cold. It can protect for some time but not for long in open air. Cloth Material is so good and thick. Perfect choice to keep you warm at home. Fitting is bit loose choose the correct size as per your need otherwise it looks bit odd.,4
B07HDLPVLH,Nice soft and warm,5
B07HDLPVLH,Very good fit.,5
B07HDLPVLH,"Great fit, comfortable",5
B07HDLPVLH,Weak Elastic,4
B07HDLPVLH,"If your a woman between 5'8 and 6 feet tall, on the leggy side you'll understand the pain of finding joggers that don't turn into capris.Since the average US man is 5'10"" use my little lifehack and orde these. They aren't a tapered as I might wish and the colors aren't my first pick. But the price can't be beat!These do the trick",5
B07HDLPVLH,"Fits perfect, very comfortable ; will order again!",5
B07HDLPVLH,Run a bit small,5
B07HDLPVLH,So so comfy!!,5
B07HDLPVLH,I bought these for my husband and sons last year. They have literally lived in them! They loved them so much I bought them each another pair for Christmas this year. Good price as well. Highly recommend!,5
B07HDLPVLH,"I am pleasantly surprised at the soft feel of these on the inside. I was skeptical when I got them that they are 50/50, but the 50 that's not cotton is on the outside, not on the inside or overall throughout the fabric. Well now see what you've gone and done? Now I need to go order some more. Fibromyalgia approved! Oh, btw, 5'2"" female with 31"" waist about 140 lbs fit perfectly in these.",5
B07HDLPVLH,Got for husband. Fits well and very comfortable. Good quality material!,5
B07HDLPVLH,"I searched for lightweight sweat pants, was supprised with the price.  Very good quality I'm 5' 10 & 160 the medium fit perfectly, practically no shinkge.  Omefind the pockets oo shallow ,but I haven't had any problems with anythingalling out.  I'd highly recommend if you want a lightweight sweatpant",4
B07HDLPVLH,These light weight sweatpants look great and fit perfect! Easy on the billfold too! Will buy again,4
B07HDLPVLH,Great fit and fabric,5
B07HDLPVLH,I like that they have pockets and are very comfortable,5
B07HDLPVLH,They are so warm and comfortable,5
B07HDLPVLH,Size length and wearable,4
B07HDLPVLH,Easy simple and feels great,4
B07HDLPVLH,"I got this sweatpants for my husband.He likes them ,he says they are super comfortable,super warm and he would buy them again and again.",5
B07HDLPVLH,Warm and comfyGood quality,5
B07HDLPVLH,these are very comfortable lounge pants for cheap!,5
B07HDLPVLH,"Soft, comfortable, made well.",5
B07HDLPVLH,It came in today and its comfy. It doesn't itch like most pants does. It feel so good. Lol The legging is a little long though if you're 5'5.,5
B07HDLPVLH,Brought  it for my son he likes it when going shopping especially now when it is really freezing cold.,5
B07HDLPVLH,"I'll be buying these again, great quality",5
B07HDLPVLH,My BF loves these! Good price and great quality. Will purchase again.,5
B07HDLPVLH,I liked them so much I got a second pair because I have issues finding sweatpants that are long enough.,5
B07HDLPVLH,Waist fit good legs a little long.,4
B07HDLPVLH,Nice sweats with pockets but the small is to long and they are a little big but I am very short and little for a man or woman really!,4
B07HDLPVLH,"These quickly became a frequent wear of mine.  The thick material provides warmth for times of cold, and the size/fit is slightly baggy to provide a sense of comfort. This blue I got was a beautiful navy blue that pairs well with many of my outfits, so I'm very happy with the selection of colors available. This is one of those hidden gems that give you a bang for your buck. Does everything it promises and more.",5
B07HDLPVLH,This was a perfect fit for my husband. The length and fit was perfect,5
B07HDLPVLH,"After trying on my partner's old Hanes sweatpants, I decided it was time to get my own. I searched in stores but found their stock was limited, so I turned to Amazon and purchased these. My main criteria were that they be oversized, soft, black, and not thick since it's still warm in Texas. These sweatpants checked all those boxes!Unfortunately, they started pilling in the thigh area after just one use, which was disappointing. To clarify, I only wore them for lounging and wasn't working out in them. For sweatpants in this price range, I expected better durability.While I like the comfort and fit, the pilling issue is a major letdown, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.",3
B07HDLPVLH,looks good fits great,5
B07HDLPVLH,Sweat pants fit good,5
B07HDLPVLH,"Great, threads come out easily.",4
B07HDLPVLH,Great pants for lounging around in or wearing to town,5
B07HDLPVLH,I love them! Wished I had gotten more than one pair!!!,5
B07HDLPVLH,Comfortable sweats. Great for a cold weekend morning lounging with a cup of coffee.,5
B07HDLPVLH,"True fit, soft, wash well. Bought another color.",5
B07HDLPVLH,"Comfortable, true to size, just like the picture and description",5
B07HDLPVLH,Bad: shallow pockets.,4
B07HDLPVLH,"Pants fit well, very comfortable. My wallet has fallen out of my front pocket twice and back pocket once. Luckily, the one time I didn't realize it right away, someone turned it in. Around the house pants only now.",3
B07HDLPVLH,"They're good for what they are, but they're not remotely snug around the ankles or tapered (and I'm a big dude, 6'2"" @ 220 lbs with tree trunk legs). I'd call them regular sweatpants not joggers. I bought a size large which is normal for me and yeah, not what I'd call a jogger fit.",3
B07HDLPVLH,I wear medium and the medium pants are too big.,3
B07HDLPVLH,"I bought the Hanes Men's EcoSmart Jogger Sweatpants for my son, and he really likes them! The midweight fleece is soft and cozy, perfect for lounging or casual outings. The style and fit are great, and the eco-friendly fabric is a nice touch. However, they could use a bit more length for the size they are. While they still fit well, the length feels a bit short compared to other joggers.",4
B07HDLPVLH,I love these pants and own several pair already that fit perfectly. I wear large. This pair was like extra large plus. Returned after trying on for refund.,3
B07HDLPVLH,ordered medium...normally works great...legs too long,4
B07HDLPVLH,But...a tad lighter material than I hoped..but OK...nice fit..nice price!,4
B07HDLPVLH,"Bought XL -- seems a little large, and feels... plastic-y? Just not that comfortable compared to a pair of L sweatpants I bought from them a few years before (and still have). I think their quality may be slipping.",3
B07HDLPVLH,"good price, fast delivery, but a little oversized. I reccomend ordering smaller size",3
B07HDLPVLH,"The fleece material is good. Received in good condition, no seam tears as some comments stated.No pilling after washing and drying them. The legs are slightly baggy, but overall a good fit. I am 5'-4"" , length a little long, but after adjusting the leg with tapered cuff, fit is good.",4
B07HDLPVLH,Still fits after washing,5
B07HDLPVLH,"Too large. Bought a size large a few months ago, fit fine. These size Large are probably an XL.",3
B07HDLPVLH,Comfortable and fits well. Soft and holds upafter wash.,5
B07HDLPVLH,Legs are longer than normal. Drawstring is made out of cheap material. I'm replacing mine with a heavier cord that doesn't Fray. Baggy legs. Not your typical Hanes product.,3
B07HDLPVLH,"Pros;1 Material is thick, reminiscent of the traditional sweat pants.Hanes makes the best sport socks, calf high (almost knee high)on earth imv, but they don't get all of their products right.2 Calf area is perfect, for thin, not quite skinny calves, cuffs are nice, but I have to fold under, I'm a 28 waist 28/29 inseam,the elastic is perfect for a 28 waist, nice and snug without needingto tie, but inseam is if worn correctly at waist the inseam is almost 40'', lolseriously, and you don't hem up sweats that are cuffed.3 As mentioned, these are definitely on the thick side, which iswhat I wanted, they would be prefect in the winter, as Inotice that for summer, they will deliver the 'sweat' feature ofsweats. Very happy with the material composition. The overall finishof the waste band is top notch, though sadly, I need to roll it overat least once, due to the super long inseam to top of 'rise' as shownin picture comparison.Cons;1 ( I asked and got lots of helpful replies about thigh areas) The calf areas are perfect for thin, not skinny calves, butthe thigh area is a big disappointment, they are way toobaggy, which makes it look like my legs are stuck togetherat thigh area lol, like I have massive thighs, which I don'tand don't want that look. If I tape the excess in the thigharea so there is about an inch of play, not 4'' , they lookfantastic, tapped, the look is representative of my size.Why they had to balloon them out in the thigh and notjust continue the natural taper from ankles up, is beyondlogic imv. If you have thick thighs, really thick, I thinkthese will be fine for you.2 Noting the photo I included, I compare the 'rise' of thesesweats with the rise of a pair of 505 levis, levi having thenatural, traditional rise, not overly high, and not hip huggerlow rise.The sweats Rise is an astonishing, almost 15'' rise (lol) sothey would come up to the middle of my chest if I worethem as designed, not naturally secured at my waist level.The traditional, standard rise like that of the 505 shownin my size is about 10'' , which is absolutely perfect, andhas the top of the pant, the highest part of the beltedarea, about 2'' or so below the belly button, normal,and comfortable, not hip hugger, low rise, and notchest level xxl high rise.MY guess is that Hanes is using ONE PATTERN for3 or 4 sizes , to save money, and then cutting themlong or short at the ankles, borrowing from theONE SIZE FITS ALL theme.This is the 3rd time my privacy has been disrespected,what I purchase should be my own business,not anyone and everyone who handlesthe package, I got them in a clear plastic bag, not thestandard Amazon, discrete bag, or box, very unhappywith this repeating policy.I wish Hanes would take a hint from people that know theirsize and what they prefer and make them available, includedimensional drawings of what they are selling us;InseamWaistThigh width when flatCalf width when flatI don't think that is a lot to ask, and should bea boost to sales, particularly repeat sales.As mentioned, their athletic socks are the bestever imv, they are the only ones I've been buyingfor decades.",1
B07HDLPVLH,"I thought i was buying brand new sweat pants, but I'm wondering why there were a lot of animal hair on both legs.",3
B07HDLPVLH,One leg is clearly longer than the other lol,3
B07HDLPVLH,Great fit,5
B07HDLPVLH,Perfect light weight joggers,5
B07HDLPVLH,Se ve de buena calidad perl es enormeCreo tendre que devolverlo talla m es como talla L,5
B07HDLPVLH,"Sweats fit well, but the fleece back of these sweats pills and sheds a ridiculous amount. Will have to see if the navy blue fluff stops shedding after washing.",3
B07HDLPVLH,"What you would expect from Hanes. Quality,  soft, very comfortable. However, I have a 32"" inseam and the legs at the bottom ride up on me while I sleep.",5
B07HDLPVLH,Pants are warm and cozy but it feels like the pockets are all sown in backwards,3
B08LTC498Q,These fleece joggers are very comfortable and fit me very well for my size.  I seem to have problems finding a sweat pants my size as 6'0 267lb Size 4XL.  Perfect for the Fall to Winter season for warmth without the need to wear thermal pants underneath.,5
B08LTC498Q,"I ordered these sweats because they had zipper and hopefully deep pockets(I keep my wallet in my front right pocket).  They arrived on time, and I tried on a pair on right away.  Oh,  ""no zipper"" on the pockets, they were deep and upon further examining them found a ""zippered side pocket next to the regular pocket"", but only on the right side.  Looks like it is for a cell phone but could hold other items.  The pant sizes run a bit small so order the next size up.  The material is thick, very warm and will be great when it gets colder.  I was happy with the sweats, the price and was going to order another set but decided to wait to see how the hold up after being washed.  Good deal!",4
B08LTC498Q,"The pants are great for working out. The Athletic fit is nice but the groin area is tight so size up. The zipper is for decorative purposes only, and will fail if used frequently. The stitching for the most part holds up except for the ankle area.",3
B08LTC498Q,"These joggers fit just right.  The fit is athletic, so slimmer with less bulk.  Material is nice and the pants seem well made.",5
B08LTC498Q,"I do like them. They're pretty nice and I didn't have the fit problem other people seemed to have, but they are definitely quite cheaply made. It's falling apart at the seams and there are a ton of seams going down the leg. I'm afraid eventually they're going to turn into shorts at this point.",3
B08LTC498Q,"I bought XL for my husband who is 250lbs &  6'2. First thing he mentioned was the comfortability, and warmth. They fit everywhere else except the waist. The pants get lose oftent and fall down to expose his underwear. The ones he has worn most are beginning to get little fizzies on them. Otherwise a good product for the price.",4
B08LTC498Q,"These run small. Had to return the first set also since 2 of the 3 were one size and the other was another., even then they run small. Other than that good quality",4
B08LTC498Q,These sweatpants are a thick soft material and overall seem well made. I had to return and swap for a bigger size as they run small. I usually buy men's sweat pants because the woman's sweat pants are too tight on my thighs and backside. These are fitted very similar to woman's style joggers.,4
B08LTC498Q,"I usually buy my bf a 2XL in this type of pants, but with this brand, I had to get Large. So order 2 sizes smaller than u usually wear.",4
B08LTC498Q,There is a large zipper pocket down the leg and the actual zipper is a bit annoying and the pocket is not useful.,4
B08LTC498Q,"Nice jogger, warm, stylish. Immediately wore first pair and loved them (Christmas day)! The next day he went to put on the 2nd pair and we noticed a seam in the back of the thigh was never fully sewn (a section of about 3-4 inches).  I'll repair it myself (since already wore a pair) and we will move forward.",4
B08LTC498Q,Good fit,4
B08LTC498Q,Very nice fleece pants that are good for winter. Warm and comfortable.,4
B08LTC498Q,Very comfortable.,4
B08LTC498Q,Muy confortables,4
B08LTC498Q,Super comfortable and fit well. They do seem to rip easily on the seams.,4
B08LTC498Q,Very nice pants,4
B08LTC498Q,My son absolutely loved them and they look great on him. They were also thick as well with great material.,5
B08LTC498Q,Exactly what I was looking for. Thick and well stitched. Fit great and are perfect for everyday or at the gym.,5
B08LTC498Q,Fit a bit small to size but I'm happy with purchase,4
B08LTC498Q,Pockets feels nice,4
B08LTC498Q,Very good value for the price. Did have one pair that needed a small mend to the seam but it was a simple fix that took mere seconds. No complaints from the teenager so major plus for this mama!,4
B08LTC498Q,Super useful to go to the gym,5
B08LTC498Q,The men I bought them for love them.,5
B08LTC498Q,Nice product but I expected 2 zippered pockets not  one HUGE pocket which unzips all of the way to the bottom of the pocket. If you're cool with that these are nice.,4
B08LTC498Q,"They arrived in good time and in good condition.  Have worn all three pairs as of recent, only complaint is one of the pair faded after wash, the dark blur turned a charcoal looking color.  Other than that the fit is very good and would and will but more.",4
B08LTC498Q,Heavy materal,5
B08LTC498Q,"Love the fit, keeps you warm and nice fit",5
B08LTC498Q,son loves them great product and quality. has pockets and has held up well so far with teen son.,5
B08LTC498Q,Delivery was on time.But why don't the drivers ever ring the door bell.A picture is nice. A ring is better.,4
B08LTC498Q,True to the size I'm loving my purchase,4
B08LTC498Q,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Has cool pockets.  Good value for three.  Fabric feels kind of cheap on outside but super comfortable on inside .,4
B08LTC498Q,My Son loved them he even wants more,4
B08LTC498Q,Purchased for my son who is 6'0 and weighs 190. They fit good!,4
B08LTC498Q,"More of a pj feeling material then jogging pants, the actual material feels good but I had one of them with the right side pocket barely attached so it gave me the impression of it being cheaper.",3
B08LTC498Q,They fit like a charm and are warm and comfortable to wear,5
B08LTC498Q,They fit my 12 year old son perfectly! Great purchase.,5
B08LTC498Q,These fit great! Better than the typical baggy sweatpants. These are stylish enough to not feel uncomfortable going out in public in but comfy enough to lounge in all day!,5
B08LTC498Q,"I got these for my husband who is going for a knee replacement in a couple of days. I received them and they are great sweats but they had a super strong chemical smell. I had to wash them 3 times, run them through the dryer with lavender scent, and leave them hanging on a line outside overnight. I think the smell is finally minimal... I did NOT expect to have to go through all this!",3
B08LTC498Q,The person I got these for really liked them. They are thick and durable.,5
B08LTC498Q,Good,5
B08LTC498Q,These are so soft and comfy. But the waist line is a little low for my liking. They are warm and feel well made.,4
B08LTC498Q,Fabric was soft and they fot exactly as expected. I have washed them several times and they have not shrunk.,5
B08LTC498Q,Very great feel and good for working out,5
B08LTC498Q,Super comfy !,5
B08LTC498Q,Bought these as gift for my son-in-law.  He loves the fit and quality.,5
B08LTC498Q,My son love theseThey have zipper on pocketsPerfect length,5
B08LTC498Q,"I was specifically looking for joggers where the pockets have zippers. The title says the ""pockets"" (plural) have zippers, but it's actually an additional pocket on one side that has a zipper. The fleece seems like good quality, but wearing these for one day reassured me why I need zipper pockets. I kept losing items in both pockets while sitting. Please either fix the item name or (preferably) actually have zippers on the side pockets.",3
B08LTC498Q,The pockets in each pair of jogging pants was ripped they didn't have any pockets just big wholes in them.,3
B08LTC498Q,They fit great. Stylish and super comfortable.  Size is accurate and they're very soft. Only bummer is one came with a hole in the ankle seam.,4
B08LTC498Q,"These get really warm, so it's not for casual wearing and these don't look as nice as in the pictures. Too loose in waist area but tight around thighs. Overall, these are just okay for the price.",3
B08LTC498Q,"I like the sweats, however they took several weeks to arrive. After opening the package, instead of the black, blue and grey I ordered, I received 2 grey that are exactly alike and a black pair. I like the quality, they are very comfortable.",3
B08LTC498Q,"Good fit, low price, uncertain longevity of  pants.  Material and quality of construction may not hold up over time.",3
B08LTC498Q,"You get what you pay for. Fabric is nice. Seems on one pair I had to reset after one wash. Suggested size is ok maybe go one up (Especially if you have dangling bits).They are around the house lazy wear for me, so it's fine.",3
B08LTC498Q,Love them would buy more,4
B08LTC498Q,"Looks decent for something cheap, keeps my son warm but gets dingy fastFits perfect",3
B08LTC498Q,"Ordered the right size for myself, but it turns out to be a little loose on the thigh area. Doesn't look anything like the picture. It's pretty warm and comfortable though.",3
B08LTC498Q,i ordered a 3 pack and all 3 have different problems and seems coming loose and undone.and its been hard hard hard to get any type of compensation from them,3
B08LTC498Q,"The pants fit nicely when standing but when i sit or lean over the rear rids down a lot. I work out a lot and was hoping to use these at the gym in the winter, but every time i bend over it feels like the rear is trying to pull down. I thought it may have been a flaw with only one pair, but all 3 have the same issue.They are still comfortable and warm though.",3
B08LTC498Q,"i am so comfortable with, and also it is so soft.",5
B08LTC498Q,"I bought these for my grandson. The material is of high quality, and they are a perfect fit. He loves them.",5
B08LTC498Q,Great quality! They look nice and my husband says they are very comfortable.,5
B08LTC498Q,The fabric and quality fells really good,4
B08LTC498Q,"The zippered takes some getting used to. Over all very pleased with size, comfort, color I chose, and delivery time. Would get again.",5
B08LTC498Q,"Very comfortable and warm,my boyfriend loves it!",5
B08LTC498Q,Muy buenos para el uso diario de mi hijo con necesidades especiales ir a su programa.,4
B08LTC498Q,"Bought these pants for my slim teenager,  got a size small. They fit perfectly, are very soft and warm. I was surprised at how thick they are. Very good quality,  I'll be buying more colors for sure!",5
B08LTC498Q,"I can't post a picture, because I had them sent to my son as a gift.He has told me several times, that he really likes these joggers and how comfortable they are.I will probably order another set of 3 pair of the Ultra Performance Joggers for him, for Christmas.  He especially likes the camo colored ones.  He told me that they launder very nicely.  They are his first joggers that have a zipper pocket and that's a plus, when he goes shopping.",5
B08LTC498Q,"Comfort, warmth, style",5
B08LTC498Q,Very good for the winter days very warm and the quality is amazing.,5
B08LTC498Q,Great joggers!! Husband loves them!,5
B08LTC498Q,"Requiere de mucho cuidado, de lo contrario se llena de peluza,es para poco uso",3
B08LTC498Q,Just exactly right.,5
B08LTC498Q,"Better than I thought, they're awesome",5
B08LTC498Q,I just got these joggers and i put them on and they are one of the softest most comfy pair of pants ive had in a while but a probelm i had with the first pair is the pocket. I put my hand in and the seam at the bottom had a hole. It wasnt a small hole that i could over look but a large one that kept growing the more it was touched. It is only one pocket in one of the pairs so it isnt worth returning as they are still usable but it was disappointing seeing the poor quality control as it was the very first of the three pairs that i put on that had the hole.,3
B08LTC498Q,I did not believe the feel of the sweats would be like this(I need to read description better) but if you live in the North with colder climates and snow these sweats are for you....5 star for you but down here in the South(Florida) not really a good feel.,3
B08LTC498Q,good feel,4
B08LTC498Q,Pocket with zipper showed up ripped. Other than that the pants look in ok shape.,4
B08LTC498Q,"Medium weight and super comfy.  They run a little large, especially in the legs.",4
B08LTC498Q,"I bought these pants since I didn't have any warm ones. And they are warm. However, the seams bust from very minimal very normal wear and tear. I don't use these for exorcise or even to go out really and I've had to sew all three sweats back up at least once.",3
B08LTC498Q,Yes! Fit was great and my guys are very happy with them,5
B08LTC498Q,My boys like the fit and versatility.,5
B08LTC498Q,Good fit and thick material. After 4 washes it is starting to pill.,3
B08LTC498Q,Love the sweatpants there soft and comfortable,5
B08LTC498Q,The grey pair pocket wasn't all the way sewed up the other pairs was.,3
B07MGJ1DM5,"My 20-something son loves these, which is a pretty high bar to meet. The medium fits perfectly. He's 5 -10 and a lean build. Good weight for keeping you warm outdoors while not overheating indoors.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,But not super snug. Keeps em warm with added layers.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Bought these for light hiking and snow blowing the property. Ordered an XL so they would fit me length wise and waist wise (33-34"" inseam) they're a teeny bit shorter than I expected, a little baggy on the calves and thighs but a bit tight at the waist. Which is weird. I'm not as slim as I used to be, but I have large, muscular legs and an average waist(35-36in pants). For the waist to be tight and the legs to be a little roomy is very, very uncommon especially for base layers. I almost always have a loose waist and tights because of the size and length.That being said, they're fine enough. I'm not doing yoga in them. I can bend over and stretch and crouch down all fine with little to no restriction in movement. I would say my biggest gripe is them being called midweight advertised for pretty cold temps and they're more light-to-mid weight. I wouldn't use them for a trip in the snow for more than maybe 2 hour or so at a time. I'd use them if I worked outside and made frequent trips in doors or inside of a vehicle. But I wouldn't use them to sit in a blind and hunt for 8 hours. Which I think is fair considering their price point. I'd recommend preparing to order and return at least one pair to get the sizing right. Other than that, not too bad. I like them and continue to wear them.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"Excellent quality.  Hubs is tall so I ordered the XL Tall, forgetting his height is mainly through his torso.  I can verify that this size will fit a really tall guy.  He loves them anyway.  Reordering the regular XL today.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,These are super warm and comfortable!,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Purchases these for my grandson who works in an unheated warehouse.  They have been a huge help for him..,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Nice longjohns, I was surprised reinforced in the thigh and the area nice and thick",5
B07MGJ1DM5,The first one was stolen but they were replaced quickly and I received them right on time. Very happy with the service. True to size.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Keeps warm. Little tight for 2 Xl tall.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,My husband likes them.  He is a big man. Material is soft and well made. Long enough also for his 6'2 height. Now to see how long they last and  hold up ...,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Excellent fit and quality.  Way cheaper than Milwaukee,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Great fit sizing is correct,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"It seems that they are well made but the fabric is VERY thin, much thinner than another brand that I have previously worn, so I'm not sure how much warmth they'll add as a base layer. Putting my hand within the pant leg and I can see my hand through the material. I expected more coming from Carhartt especially considering the cost per pant and considering they are advertised as a ""cold weather"" base layer. I decided to return them and go back to the 'other' brand I have previously worn.",3
B07MGJ1DM5,get what you pay for  tip name brand,5
B07MGJ1DM5,My husband loves these,5
B07MGJ1DM5,The description lead me to believe i was purchasing a combination top and bottom but received only bottoms.,3
B07MGJ1DM5,These work really well when wearing under my work cloths,4
B07MGJ1DM5,Usually when I wear long johns my legs feel at least a little warmer. With these long johns my legs felt colder. I don't know why. I never had 100% polyester long johns before. Maybe that is the issue or maybe it is the way the polyester is processed or woven. I bought the midweight. I don't know if the heavyweight would be better or not.,2
B07MGJ1DM5,"These pants are perfectly comfortable to work in. They stretch to move with you when you move so they don't fall down when you squat. It's soft and warm for basic Washington fall weather. But it's still hard to use the pee hole. If your going to make one, why not make it easy to use instead of having to fish yourself through multiple flaps while trying not to pee yourself. Why not have an open hole with a velcro cover patch? Undue the velcro to quickly get to your pee hole, while also making sure it's not constantly exposing yourself to the weather with this easy use pee hole... anyway,  I'm not the expert clothes manufacturer here, I'm just a customer, asking for something easier for me to use when I want to go pee. Thanks for your consideration.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"I bought a Large. I am 5'4"" and 160lb. Inseam 26"". Hips at widest point 43"". Waist at belly button 38"". I am wider at the hips than the shoulder, my body shape is not the same as the target market for these pants, so buying 'mens' clothes is always a gamble. And this time it turned out! Here are the things I love about these pants: they are so so soft, light, and warm. They stretch over my hips easily. I wear them as pajama/hanging around the house pants. My favorite part of the day is when I can put them on again. Here are the things I dislike about the pants but are not dealbreakers for me: they are a couple inches too long, I have to roll them up sometimes. And the elastic waistband is a little too tight and folds in half. Overall, very gender-affirming, comfy thermals. I have not tried to wear them under pants, but I don't think it would be a problem.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"This was a gift for my son who was heading to Colorado for a ski trip. He stayed warm and dry, without feeling weighted down with heavy layers. Would buy again.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"I ordered for a person that is non-Ambulatory that has issues with sores on bottom from seams in pants, because they are always sitting in wheelchairs.Even though the seams are on the sides of buttocks it still is uncomfortable for him.It is so hard to find pants without seams in the middle of back of pants or that is not so rough that it irritates the skin.They are a great product for someone who doesn't have this problem and were even easy for me to get on him.  They are real streachy so easy to pull on.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"I'm slim, 6'5"" and the Large Tall fits perfectly.  Normally wear a 34/35 waist.  Finally a pair of non-bandaid-colored long johns that are long and I don't need safety pins to keep them on.  Baggy enough in all the right places and tight enough they stay against your skin comfortably. Cant speak to the warmth or durability yet, but the legs cover the ankle and stop right at the foot.  Excellent!",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"So I bought these as a base layer to ride my motorcycle in the colder weather.  I have a short ride to work, about 5 miles, but on cold mornings or breezy mornings it can get cold and be an unpleasant ride.  I will ride if the temp is in the 40's but not below that.  Regular pants with these underneath work well for shorter rides.  If you are riding longer you will need pants thicker than cargo or jeans if it is in the 40's.  Now in the 50's it is perfect for any length of ride.  I would recommend these as a good base layer.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"When I first took them out of the package I thought there was no way these could be very warm. They're very lightweight. I work in EMS and wear these under my 5.11 uniform pants, and they make it feel like I'm wearing pajamas all day, while also keeping me warm.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"My husband works outside, hunts and fishes, even in winter the purchased him a set of these thermals.This brand makes the best products. I was not disappointed in the thermals has been lodged down, and I was able to find big and tall on Amazon..",5
B07MGJ1DM5,Super thin polyester. Definitely not medium weight. Really expected more from Carhartt brand and price. Might keep you warm in August.,2
B07MGJ1DM5,"Good fit, warm",4
B07MGJ1DM5,Fit is very good. Length is just right and is very comfortable in the cold. My initial wear was at work driving cars in/out of -15 degree wind chill weather.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,The Carhartt brand speaks for itself.  These are polyester and not cotton which means the color doesn't fade and shrinkage is generally extremely minimal. Polyester unlike cotton wicks away moisture which in return reduces bacteria and odor. These base layer midweight long underwear look nice and fit as expected and seem to be well constructed. The separate matching top basically gets my same re0view except the top is a bit short and doesn't allow much to tuck in. I highly recommend you purchase both top and bottom.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,It is hard from the pictures and description to tell just what weight of fabric the thermal pants will be.  These were a lighter fabric than expected and the cuffs of the thermal pants were looser than I thought they would be.  I have another Carhartt thermal pants that are heavier and the cuffs fit snug so that wind won't come up the leg.  I prefer the cuffs to fit snug; no matter what weight.  I would choose a heavier weight of fabric when I order another pair.,4
B07MGJ1DM5,Carhart has great quality. Gotta pay more to get a good quality.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Just a heads' up for those looking for thermal underwear that will keep you warm during sub-zero temps. These won't do that. I have a 30-year old pair of the old fashioned long underwear that work better than these for that.,3
B07MGJ1DM5,"Used for 2 winters now, not showing any wear and are great thermals especially for how low profile they are.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"I do love Carhartt! With that said, I was a little disappointed in this purchase. In Carhartt style, the quality is as expected and they will last as most of Carhartt products do. But these were not as warm as I epected in a medium weight long underwear and I should have gotten the heavier weighted set. I already have a light weight set I bought for cross country skiing and found these are about as warm as my light weight set. I can only surmise these are designed for a certin type of activity, and not sitting around an ice hole. So don't view this as a complaint but more of a recommendation.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,Wish it was. Xxl,3
B07MGJ1DM5,"I got these for my husband for Christmas and he has been wearing them once a week for the last 6 weeks.  They wash well, we have not put them in the dryer.  At 5'11"" and 160 pounds (he is built like a soccer player) he complains that the medium is just a little tight in the nether region. He would have ordered a size up. However, he likes them so much he is ""breaking them in"".  (I should mention he likes his long underwear ""old man droopy drawers loose"", but I can see why he would size up if he is wearing them all day).",4
B07MGJ1DM5,Awesome product that you can barely feel yet keeps you warm in windy cold conditions. Makes a huge difference in the winter.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Overall this is a great product. Quite lightweight and comfortable, yet also warm. However, after just one washing, the elastic waistband developed an odd defect (i.e., a permanent hard crease in the waistband). I have no idea how the crease was created, but despite my best efforts to remove the crease (which is like a hard ""fold""), I can't remove it. I suspect that the waistband must have had a latent manufacturing defect that was exacerbated by the washing process. Hopefully Carhartt can improve the manufacturing process for the elastic waistband so that other customers don't experience the same problem.",3
B07MGJ1DM5,"Fit is great, not crazy warm but not the worst either. Definitely a comfortable base layer",5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Me: 6'0"" - 240lbs - 34-36 waist - athletic legsBought: Large TallThicker than under armour, but only because of the traditional waffle design. These are very thin. I would say these are lightweight and not mid.More form fitting than traditional/old-school  Fruit of The Loom, but definitely not a second skin like under armor. They are a little loose, and the ankles are open and not cuffed.The saddle is comfortable. Not loose, nor tight.Yes, you can wear your boxer briefs underneath and still be comfortable. You might even be able to wear regular cotton boxers if that's your speedThese dont keep me much warmer than the standard under armour cold gear tightsThink about how you are going to use these before you buy them. Make sure your expectations are aligned to what the product actually is. These definitely shouldn't be your only layer under a pair of waders or something. Its your BASE layer. Remember that. So if you plan on putting something over it, you should be in good shape.",3
B07MGJ1DM5,"Works in cold weather, we will see how well they do in Alaska.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,Good fit and works good as a base layer,5
B07MGJ1DM5,I bought these in preparation for the Arctic winter storm that hit last week. The temperature got down to 17 F which is a record low for my area. (it usually barely even freezes) I lost power for 36 hours during the coldest part of the storm and had no heat source. I wore these thermal pants for the whole 36 hours. They fit great. They fit tight enough that they went well under my jeans but loose enough as to not be constricting. Some thermals tend to cling to your legs but these didn't do that. The quality was top notch and they kept me very warm. I highly recommend them!,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Many times products in my size say they are XXL but are not really.  This brand and product were perfect and what I would expect from an underlayer.  Hunting in snow at the peak was not a problem as these were the perfect base layer to keep me warm.  Would for sure purchase again.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Bought these for my husband and bought a large. They are not snug but fairly loose. He wear size 34 or 36 jeans and thermals (cheaper) I have bought in the past have been snug fitting so I wasn't sure how these would fit because this is 1st time I bought these. My husband is happy with the fit and especially happy with the ankle band NOT being tight . They aren't as heavy as other Carhartt force thermals I have bought but husband ok with lighter weight for cooler not cold days.Yes, I would buy them again.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"I bought husband a pair of these to help keep him warm on the cold days at work- he works outside and would wear pajama pants under his work pants to held keep him warm. He loves them so much I bought three more pair for him. They fit well under his jeans and work pants, keep him warm, and aren't thick or heavy. Now his pajama pants can stay as pajamas. He is 5'7 and 150lbs and size large fits him just right.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,Performed well in freezing temperatures.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,Fine product,5
B07MGJ1DM5,i love them so far very light weight keep me warm and no sweat keep me very warm,5
B07MGJ1DM5,veary nice,5
B07MGJ1DM5,But they are paper thin no insulation valueThese might be decent quality,3
B07MGJ1DM5,These provide no more warmth than a pair of cheap thermals from walmart,1
B07MGJ1DM5,"These are warm and feel like they're durable and if good quality. My only complaint is that the legs are too short. I'm 6'1"" 190# and these are about 3"" too short at the bottom of the legs. Every time I sit down, they pull half way up my calves, exposing my lower leg and making it get cold faster. Other than the leg length though, these are great.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"It's funny the request for this just popped up, I just came in from a 15 minute walk in -5 degree (feels like -20)  I wear them under some of those Adidas work out pants and im tellin ya, they work!  along with the UA balaclava i bought here, i am good to go...now just got to find some gloves that work better than my UA WR football winter gloves",5
B07MGJ1DM5,The fit is good. As an under layer it is not slick as you might want to put with jeans or cotton pants and tends to pull your pants when squatting. Not very bulky.  I would like more stretch for freedom of movement and a slicker surface.  I will probably not get another pair and go with an something less cotton based.,4
B07MGJ1DM5,These are not compression fit or tight to the skin so be mindful these will fit better under some looser fitting pants. They're pretty thin and wearing them on 40* days in a windy Georgia winter they do well. I wouldn't wear these in snow or anywhere that keeping warm means survival but for wearing all day indoor/outdoor I would feel comfortable in these.,4
B07MGJ1DM5,I got these because I work outdoors at the Cincinnati Airport for 40 hrs a week. Put these on under my work pants and I have no need for my work bibs. Must have if you work outside,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Pros:  These pants kept me warm and looked nice.Cons:  The pair I got was smaller than others I have of the same size and the fabric much stiffer than I'm used to.Because of the cons, I will not be wearing these or ordering any more of them (no larger size is available for me to order).",3
B07MGJ1DM5,It's fine so far.,4
B07MGJ1DM5,"very lightweight, gets the job done.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"My husband works outdoors most of the time and it can get very cold where we live.  Needless to say, thermal underwear is important to him. Now that I've purchased this third pair of Carrhart long johns for him, he says he will never wear any other brand of thermals.They are beautifully constructed and fit his thin frame like a dream.  We will be purchasing the matching tops for him for next.",5
B07MGJ1DM5,My husband works outside 3 mornings a week and in the cold cold mornings these work very well to keep him warm.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,They were too short in the length. I'm 6 ft 2 and they were 4 in above my ankle. I wished they offer a medium tall. I would have had to have gotten a large to get the tall. I have a 33 inch waist.,3
B07MGJ1DM5,Fit great nice and warm,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"I was disappointed when I put these on.  It didn't look like the picture at all.  Instead of powerful speedy legs, I got something more like Flamingo legs inside of a black gunny sack.  Very disappointing.  Maybe the wife is right.....I got bird legs!  Oh, and the long johns are fine, as expected from Carhartt.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,"I am a big fan of Carhartt products and this is far from my first purchase from them. The pants are light weight, reasonably warm, and fit very well. That said, I have had them roughly 3 weeks, washed less than 4 times, and they already have a thumb-sized rip in the seam of the seat. I wear these as a base layer for my extremely cold office job, so it's not like I'm putting them through rigorous activity. I'd think a seat seam could stand up to a few 10 hours days of being sat on, so I'm going to go with there being a QC issue with this pair.",3
B07MGJ1DM5,Very warm keeps the heat on you,4
B07MGJ1DM5,"Fits great, comfortable and  kept me warm all day playing a round of golf in the mid 30's",5
B07MGJ1DM5,I wear these under sweat pants and was warm in temps down to ~25F. Bit of a smell but expected from synthetics.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Very good product. A little tight for the size I ordered especially in the crotch region but other than that, a good product.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,I bought these for my son that works outside. He is very happy with the pants and top.,5
B07MGJ1DM5,"Tall size?  Wouldn't say that.  Inseam far to short, cuffs 3-4in from ankle.Tall/Large, I'm 6'8 215, other than being to short fir is pretty good.Waist isn't to bad, comes to belly button not to breast like some.",4
B07MGJ1DM5,I normally don't buy carhart often due to the fact they never have my size but these thermal underware were perfect. They are comfortable and lightweight. Perfect for the cold weather in Minnesota. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone.,4
B07MGJ1DM5,Nice if you work a job that requires you to wear a certain uniform.,4
B07MGJ1DM5,"These thermal base layer pants are very good.  The foot well have a strong waistband, and light but still warm. I'm very happy with them.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"As a wearer of a woman's size 7 shoe, these fit me very well, and they are cute.I suffer from foot, calf and hip pain since I was a teenager, which makesstanding for 8-12 hours a day at work unbearable.Then I discovered compression socks. Then I found out I can get CUTE compression socks that are well made.They don't compress as much as the ones I got from Walgreens (a single pair for basically the same price as this pack), but they are good for regular use if you are on your feet a lot. I'd say the compression is light to moderate. My foot and calf pain has virtually disappeared since purchasing these.They don't hurt me unless I forget to take them off before bed. They're comfortable so I forget I'm wearing them half of the time!They stay on my legs and are easy to put on... Just grab the inside by the heel and flip it inside out, put your foot in, then pull the rest of the sock up your calf.Mine have lasted a while but I must note that I do not run them through the dryer, only the washer with regular detergent.Also if you have pets, these don't pick up pet or human hair AT ALL, which is definitely a plus!I can't recommend these enough to my co-workers of all ages, definitely worth a try if you are considering buying them.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Supportive and pretty love these hose. Highly recommend. Colors are as pictured. Fits nicely, seem durable have only worn once. Legs felt super suppprtive.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Got these for my daughter. She loves them. The material is soft and the compression is perfect. These are so cute. They don't roll down and are a great value.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"These are very comfortable - not too tight on me.  I'm petite and as long as I don't pull up too far they come right below my knee.  I've worn them for a week now and have not had swollen ankles.  Even if they didn't work, they are an extremely nice sock!!  I've washed and dried several times and they don't shrink.  Just ordered another pack of them.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,They leave marks on your upper legs which can be painful at times ! Too tight even when you get the right size!,3
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"My docs look at these socks and always question if they are really ""compression"" socks (I have to where because my blood pressure drops). I bought a medical grade for my size per their request, however I put these on still.  These offer more compression, way more cute and stylish and I got more bang for the buck!!  Over all if you are just looking for cute compression socks these are well made and work great.  I can't remember size I ordered but I believe it was true to size because I wear a size 8-8.5 medium-wide and these fit up to my knee perfect.  I am only 5'2 but have a bigger calf than when I bought them 2 years ago. 2 years ago they did bunch slightly at the knee because of my shorter leg.  Have held up great for 2.5 years!  Still my fave go to!  Recommend!!",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"RE: Size, I really wrestled with size as I wear an 8 1/2 -9 shoe and I had post-op swelling.  The foot size for L-XL was too large for me, the heel sits high, above my heel, towards my lower leg.  Otherwise, great fit though the leg and very good quality.  I will buy again in size S-Med",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Love these compression socks! Started wearing them when I was had swelling in my legs and the doctor recommended I get compression socks. These are so cute and super easy to get on and off and actually worked! Swelling gone! I wish they made thigh high socks!,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I have large calves and have trouble finding socks that aren't constricting at the top. These are comfortable for all day wear and are cute enough when they peak through at the ankle.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I love these socks! I also brought my mother-in-law and father-in-law Sam and they are in love with them as well. They offer a good support and are not too difficult to put on!!,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Used for overseas flight. First two pairs used hubby and I both noticed seam at toes rubbed funny and left our pinky toes sore (no tear in skin). Second pairs we both noticed seam issue was gone so no pinky toe issues or rubbing. Both cases no swelling in legs.,4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I really like these socks...and they're so cute! The compression is light...not really tight as I had heard from other friends that wear compression socks. Sometimes my calf muscles ache...I stand quite a bit. They don't ache when wearing these socks. I'm glad I gave them a try.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Not bad. They aren't very snug, but they are like knee socks that don't fall down every few minutes. I don't have the smallest calves, but these aren't doing the job that other compression socks do.They are comfortable though.My main complaint is there are no washing instructions. Can these go in the dryer? Are they drip dry only? They don't say.",4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,They go on easy and stay up all day and they come off easy.,4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I bought these following a fractured foot for added support when I run.  They are good quality and launder very well.  Will repurchase.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Fit wash perfect after one wash. Great value for the money. Definitely helps decrease the swelling and pain in legs.,4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Recently needed compression socks to help with circulation in my legs. Along with elevating my legs, I could feel the circulation improving after just a short while of wearing a pack (bought pack of 6 to try). Even when I was walking around wearing the socks, they gave a noticeable improvement to how I was feeling! Definitely recommend!",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Loved these compression socks during my pregnancy. Never had a problem with them rolling I wore them for a straight 8 months.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"I love the fabric and materials, color choices",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Loved the fit and quality.  The colors and patterns were very cool.  I wear them everyday.  The compression is very mild.  Easy to put on.  Would have preferred more compression.  But overall a very good buy for the price.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"These socks are great! I use to have leg cramps from standing all day at work, but these have helped tremendously with that issue. Well worth the money for these. True to size.",4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,The color and fit are great.  They are durable and the colors are good.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,As a flight attendant I love these. It helps a lot.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Feel good all day,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Love these compression socks! They fit my legs well, are very snug and comfortable.The one downer but not a deal breaker is that I did not receive what the picture showed. The two shades of gray turned out to be a navy blue and a gray. The deep dark brown turned out to be a rust brown.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I purchased these to give to the nurses that take care of me they love them,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I like these,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Total of 6 pairs received.  Five pairs were inserted into individual wrappers: one pair (grey) was just shoved into the mailing envelope (unwrapped); seemingly at the last minute before shipping and appears to have been worn and is slightly soiled at the heels.  I am keeping the five pairs and discarding the one grey pair.  Since my doctor advises that I began wearing these, I'll just absorbed the small cost of the one pair. No need to return or replace.  Thank you.",4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Provides just enough support.  Not too tight, and did not slip after a full days wear on a lowkey weekend day.  The true test will be the condition of my ankles and joints after a full work day (I walk ALOT).  Will explore other colors and patterns if they pass that test.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Love these socks. I no longer have tied feet or legs when I get home. No more swollen ankles. But these. You won't regret it.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I love these compression socks they are super soft and comfortable!,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Comfortable and easy to put on,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Well made, nice colors and excellent price.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Very comfortable to wear all day,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"I recently started experiencing some discomfort in my legs, especially after long periods of sitting on an airplane. I decided to try the BLUEENJOY Copper Compression Socks, and I'm so glad I did! These socks provide excellent support and significantly reduce the discomfort I was feeling. They feel incredibly comfortable to wear and don't slip down throughout the day.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Exactly what I ordered and great price,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,great socks,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I'm pregnant and i get so tired at work from walking and I absolutely love these. They go right below the knee and area tight but not to right that they are uncomfortable. They do not skip down either.  They help so much and definitely recommend.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Gives slight compression without being difficult to put on or uncomfortable to wear. I use these when I walk, and as an added bonus, they keep my legs warm on the colder days. The color choices are decent too. Not exactly ""stylish"" but I don't plan on wearing them to any high class functions! Just around the neighborhood (mostly under pants, so you can't see them anyway) to walk.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Very nice and comfortable,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Looks great and works n fits like expensive ones.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I'm an ER nurse and have been wearing compression socks for at least 20 years.  These are the best hose I've worn!  I ordered another 1/2 dozen!  I advise every new nurse I train to start wearing support six.  They decrease leg fatigue and over the long haul help the wearer maintain the best circulatory health.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I stand on my feet all day nearly every day and these have helped with the pain! Highly recommend if you're a server,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"I just received delivery of these socks this week. I have not wanted to take them off. I love the cute designs and they make my feet and legs feel as though they are in paradise! I am thinking of ordering more, there were some more cute designs.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Easy to put on and very  durable,4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Selection and price!,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,They are well made comfortable stay up go up to knee come in many design choices and really work.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I worried a knee sock might be too tight at the knee but it is not. I am a RN and can honestly say these socks make a huge difference by decreasing my leg and foot fatigue after a 12 hour shift . will buy them again!!!,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"I have a size 9 foot and these fit perfect. They go beyond my calf, to the knee. They are comfortable, great quality, stay in place,  stylish and affordable. Will definitely purchase again in more colors.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Arrived on time and in great condition,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,These are comfortable compression socks.,4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,They feel good,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"quality seemed good, delivery is in time, to send as gifts.",4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Like them very much. Very comfortable..,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,The material and design is awesome. Unfortunately the size is way off. I have a 19 calf and ordered per their size guide. Way too tight. Hard to pull up n then can't leave on long. See the indents made by the style on my legs. Big calves? Don't buy. I can't return because I wore the same one for several days hoping it would stretch a little with wear...nope. Can't see them taking them back n getting me a refund. Maybe I can give the remaining ones to someone..,3
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Started wearing these after surgery and conjnute to wear them working 12 hour shifts on the floor as a nurse. They are cute and comfy,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Stylish and comfortable AND they work!! They fit tightly and I have no swelling at the end of the day,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Love these! Cute, comfortable and good compression.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Design is fun and classy. But the sock themselves are more of a nylon feel nothing like a cotton sock. They pinch at my ankle area and the toe works its way off the toes during wear.,3
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Good color arrangement. Very durable,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"These socks don't squeeze your legs so you have no circulation,they are very comfortable.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Fit well, helps with swelling ,easy to put on and wash without srinking .",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,These knee highs have just the right amount of compression and they wash beautifully. I really like them!,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Not as tight or precise as prescription socks, but adequate for casual use.",4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Colorful and fun,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"I did not recieve all the colors as advertised in the photo. After looking at more reviews once I recieved the socks, it is apparently a known issue with this variety. I am 5 foot and the socks went above my knee. I don't recommend for short women.",3
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Supports my feet & legs while standing up all day at work!!! Will buy more...,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Really good quality,foot a little to long, just a little to snug but good socks",4
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I used these to fly internationally and they worked well. Glad I got them...A+++,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I wear these stocking every day. They feel great. My legs no longer get crampy. I'm a nurse so I am on my feet fairly frequently. Great quality. They stay in place all day. From 530 am to 830 pm. Never have to readjust them. They wash great. I put them in the washer but let them air dry. No problems. I would definitely purchase again.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Great very comfortable a little tight at the top but most compression socks are but definitely durable and works well,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"I love this socks. Comfortable, good quality. Would purchase again",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Lacked in compression around my ankle where I also needed it,3
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Love these socks! They fit well and the compression is not too bad. I have painful leg spasms at night and put this on before bed the first night. Slept all night without cramps! So happy I ordered these. Now to see how they hold up over time.,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"Brought stockings for a gift . Very fashionable color and easy to put on. My neice love the fit, support and quality.  Would buy again.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,"These worked great during my pregnancy and were MUCH cuter than the ones the doctor wanted me to get, haha.",5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,Love them,5
B07ZFJ5RPJ,I like that they are warm and  comfortable.,4
B075JTR46M,"BOUGHT: Several pairs of size XXL sweatpants, in different colors, from this vendor.ME: 67 years old, 6'1"" weight floats around between 195-205lbs (weight not stable not matter how little I eat, ever since cancer-riddled thyroid was removed last year).  Both for the sake of Islamic Modesty, as well as for ""old man likes it baggy and comfortable"" these pants are perfect for me, at least!Material is thick, warm and comfortable. DOES NOT SHRINK or show ""pilling"" in the fabric when washed (colors setting"" and dried ""normal setting"".You get two strong SEPARATE tie-strings inside, with the ends ""whipped"" by plastic so they won't start to fray (look like the Jolly Green Giant's shoe laces). Not the continuous loop of small string, that once tied can almost never be untied (like most other MFG's sweat pants come like).  BIG PLUS in my opinion.The elastic waist is strong enough to keep the pants up (if your waist size falls within what they state a size XXL should fit) yet not so tight that it becomes uncomfortable.  For me, I can wear these from morning until just before bedtime, and they never leave a mark on my skin, nor ever feel uncomfortable.I'm in the habit of removing tags and washing my new clothes FIRST before wearing them.  I have 6-pairs in different colors. NONE of them shrank even a little bit. None of the colors appear faded - one pair was washed and worn 4-times (the ""test order"") before the other ones arrived, and even that one shows no color fading, shrinking, or pilling of the material.  Insha Allah these pants will give many good years of wear.I'm not one of these young guys who like to wear tight pants to show off their junk to the girls.  Nope, I want just the opposite - roomy, baggy comfort that lasts all day. These pants have PLENTY of space between the waist and the crotch, so ""the boys and their dad"" have plenty of room (and the girls don't see anything outlined).Another thing I like, there is PLENTY of room in the SEAT of the pants.  Unlike so many I have tried in stores (and returned here on Amazon) where the seat seems like it was made for a hind-end that is flat as a sheet of plywood.  Nope, not these pants, they are tailored in the seat area for plenty of room there as well.My inseam size is 34"" - these size XXL pants are perfect the way they come for me - wife didn't need to take up too-long legs. This made her happy too.I would totally buy more of these (except I already have 6-pairs). Well, maybe one day IF they ever get size XXL in BLACK in stock again, I'll buy one more.Years from now when these wear out and I need more, I would totally buy these again IF they are still made the to the same quality & fit in the future.",5
B075JTR46M,"I was pleasantly surprised when my new Amazon Essentials sweat pants arrived today.  Similar sweat pants sell for more than four times the price of these in some stores.  I normally wear a medium size in clothes, but I ordered a small after reading the reviews.  I am 5 feet 10 inches tall and have a 32 inch waist.  The small size is a perfect fit, both in length and at the waist.  The pants are warm and comfortable.  The navy blue color looks very nice; I have another pair in gray coming soon.  I highly recommend these.  They are good quality at a very reasonable price.",5
B075JTR46M,"I bought these for my son who is about 5'6"" and 120lbs. Based on the reviews and size chart, I ordered an extra small. They fit him okay, but in the sense that one wash and they would be too small. The deal price was too good to pass up and quality seemed nice. These will be returned but not sure if I'll reorder based on regular price and other brand availability.",4
B075JTR46M,"I wouldn't wear them outside. I would just keep these inside or for when I'm going to Walmart (actually no, I wouldn't wear them to Walmart either). Pockets are pretty small and no zippers and no back pockets but the quality of the stitching looks good, also I like the cuffs on the bottom though, double stitched and high quality. Basically it looks basic but very high quality, the thickness is decent, it's thicker than your average joggers but not thicker than your regular sweatpants. If you want the full dad look, wear some crocs and white socks with them.11/10/23: I really don't know why I'm bothering with this but I did want to give a one year update. These still look new to me. Granted, I haven't really abused them much, I have mostly been using them to layer under my pants during Texas winter and for that reason they are amazing. The small pockets don't bother me but I wouldn't put anything of value in there unless it's for a moment. Things hold but I wouldn't jog around with valuable things in the pocket, they aren't just small but they are at an angle that is too straight for my liking. Generally you want this style when the pockets are deep. So my biggest gripe are the small pockets but everything else about this is super high quality. I suggest just using them to warm your hands or rest your hands.Comparing this to my Premium Levi's Joggers, the joggers gave out and started threading around the hem line. These look just as new as they did on day 1. It's really baffled me. I forgot to mention that they have false waistbands. Which can be a good or a bad thing. Good as in you'll never lose the laces, bad because they don't really move so it feels weird and I feel like you can't tighten them too much without breaking them apart, however so far they haven't been ripped out yet (or heard any small rips) after putting a lot of pressure so maybe they're ok. The material isn't nylon (feels like microfiber like the rest of the pants) so it worries me that putting extra pressure might rip them out.As far as style, I was definitely not going to wear them on the outside but I did yesterday and I gotta say they're not bad if you're not already overweight. They look cute but not hot. But they can pass for the gen z baggy clothes look. So you'd have to dress accordingly: make the rest of your clothes baggy too. They work. Otherwise they're still the dad look and while I'm a dad, I definitely don't intend on looking like one. unless i'm trying the cute look and since I'm tall with a boyish body and look, they work.Last but not least, these are definitely very comfy. That's important because not all joggers/sweatpants are comfy. This definitely feels much more comfy than my other joggers/sweatpants. They are perfect for just hanging around the house or even sleeping in them (sort of like thick pajamas). Overall they feel like a tank. I haven't gone hiking with them yet or roughed them up at the dog park but having owned multiple brands, I can safely say that these will last me forever granted I use them for their purpose. But I'm not worried about them withering away or getting dethreaded after a few washes.",5
B075JTR46M,"I loved the fabric was beautiful but they were like 2 sizes 2 big for me. I'm female, usually buy XL incase they shrink when I wash them, but these would never fit me as they were so big. The fabric was a soft and very beautiful, the bottom was also open and the legs were very long. If I had been 6' or over, the pants would be fine. These are well worth the money, they were just 2 big and long for me.",5
B075JTR46M,Ordered these for my tall grandson and they were a perfect size (medium) but really too short.  He said he would keep them and wear to the gym.  I would recommend checking your inseam and comparing before ordering.  The pants are soft and look as if they will hold up to many washes.  They also seem to be well made with seams straight and no hanging threads.,3
B075JTR46M,Just bought a second pair! These are soft in side using high quality fabric.. there are pockets and the stitching is very durable with more stitching in pocket area. Fits perfect...highly reccomend these..,5
B075JTR46M,"These were huge and had to return. To compare if you wear an XXL in Blair pants then an XXL should fit in these. Sizing, fit are about the same. If you wear a size XXL in the Champions open bottom sweatpants then size down to an xl in these. Think you are between sizes just size down. Hope this helps someone not sure what size to get. Otherwise ok sweatpants for the price. Will probably reorder.",4
B075JTR46M,"Pockets longer now, but elastic waistband doesn't stretch as much now.As of Jan. 2024 they were made in Vietnam, with short pockets, and fabric that pilled. In attached 2 photos, top and tag not shown, respectively.As of Oct. 2024 made in Pakistan, with longer pockets, and fabric no longer pills. In photos, lower and tag shown, respectively.Also, the elastic waistband had more stretch in it.Dec. 2024, still made in Pakistan, but elastic waistband not as much give in it, so uncomfortable now.Plus, this latest version waistband shifts around waist almost constantly, causing unequal tension and twisting of pants.Overall, these still seem to be the best cold weather sweatpants.So, Amzn Mgmt, please fix waistband issue so it has a bit more stretch again.  TIA!!",4
B075JTR46M,"I've had bad experiences with Amazon Essential clothing as the fit is always bad, too short, too tight or awkwardly cut. these are a great fit and weight. I usually wear a large but I wanted a looser fit so I got the XL. and considering the price I thought the weight would be a little on the light side, but these are not. the cream color ones had a slightly heavier weight then the Navy but both have a good medium heavy weight. stove pipe fit",5
B075JTR46M,"The quality of these pants is stellar.  They feel expensive. They are thick & warm.  I've always worn Hanes or Fruit of the Loom, but never again.  These were exactly what I wanted.  I bought the men's medium they fit perfectly.  I also bought them in light blue.  I will be buying them every month until I have all the colors, except white...unless they come pre-stained (white clothes and I don't get along).",5
B075JTR46M,"These run large! I usually wear large but the size large was very baggy. Size medium fit me perfect. Im 6'1"" and 225 pounds. 32"" inseam and 38"" waist. And i normally never fit into a medium",5
B075JTR46M,"I bought these 4 years ago & still wear them constantly! They are extremely comfortable & have held up very well.The only downside was that for a while after buying them iirc there were little black fuzz balls that ended up all over them when washed, but that went away fairly quickly, so maybe wash them a few times in a row, or only wear them at home for a while when they are brand new until that stops. The comfort is totally worth it!",4
B075JTR46M,"Very comfortable. The black color seemed to fade rather quickly but comparing the price to other brands, this is a good buy",4
B075JTR46M,"I rarely write customer reviews but these pants deserve one. I'm 5'10"" and weight 210 and ordered the large. The waist fits great and the fabric feels terrific. They are a tad long  but I can live with that because they are so comfortable! Going to get another pair.",5
B075JTR46M,I ordered a 3X. Too big for me. Would reorder as a 2X. Will give to someone who can use. Not a problem. Thick and very soft. Would reorder.,5
B075JTR46M,"Finally found a pair of sweats that fit my 6'2, 350lb hubby perfectly. They are roomy (size down if you aren't sure), and not too long. Maybe they fixed the pocket issue, because these have normal pocket depth. Will be buying more pairs.",5
B075JTR46M,"I was expecting a flimsy poorly made item, but this is a pleasant surprise. Heavier material, nice thick waistband with a substantial tie string, good length inseam. Not often these days you get more than you expected.",5
B075JTR46M,Color is not the same as picture! Had to order this 2 times and still not the same color. Is more of a navy blue than a bright blue.1,4
B075JTR46M,"I hate to rate these 5 stars because I know they'll just raise the price! If you're like me and just like the old school Russel or Champion sweats, these are those, but less than half the price. I may just stock up now because these really are what I've been looking for. Not the cheap, thin stuff you normally get. Good for lounging or going out in the cold",5
B075JTR46M,These washed and dried well.  My husband said they were very comfortable.  Good buy.,5
B075JTR46M,These pants are soft and warm.  My husband is very thin and the XS was perfect for him.  I ended up ordering 2 more pair.,5
B075JTR46M,"Good material, nice color. Like that they don't have elastic around the bottom of legs.",5
B075JTR46M,"Bought these after a pair of sweatpants from a major name brand competitor fell apart in the laundry on the first wash. Wound up buying two more pairs. The BEST. I WFH f/t, so I am pretty picky about sweats since I pretty much live in them. Shout out to Amazon, you killed it.",5
B075JTR46M,"Pants are really soft & comfortable, however I noticed on my first wear the stitching on the left leg had come apart just below the knee opening a hole (see picture).",4
B075JTR46M,These are very comfortable and warm and with the extreme cold we are having I can already see these are going to be my go-to pants. P.S. Great price also and fast in-stock shipping. Thanks!,5
B075JTR46M,"They fit well, he loves them. No shrinkage when washed and dried.",5
B075JTR46M,"This Amazon Essential is superb.  I wear these Pants all winter as daily wear around the house.  This is heavier weight fabric, but not heavy enough to be uncomfortably hot.  Shorts in the summer, and sweatpants in the winter.  I have owned seral pair that I've purchased over the years, and still consider this my go-to winter pants.",5
B075JTR46M,I love how comfortable these are. They fit just right and are a good weight for me this time of year.,5
B075JTR46M,I'm a big guy. Like 400lbs big. These pants fit perfectly. Very comfy. And look great. I will definitely buy more.,5
B075JTR46M,"Feels awesome!Great breathing Or my berries and twig, and my tushy breathes beautiful thru the back!",5
B075JTR46M,Feels way better than what you expect based on price. Very very comfortable and chic even,5
B075JTR46M,These are a great deal for the price.  Good fit and finish.,5
B075JTR46M,"Wear them for lounging pants. Comfortable and warm. Decent price. Will see how the waist elastic holds up as that tends to be the failure point on this kind of pants.EDIT: kind of as I expected, the elastic in the waistband has pretty much failed after a couple of months of use and two washes.At least it has a drawstring.",4
B075JTR46M,Great variety of colors.  They wash up nice and are true to size,5
B075JTR46M,"I'm actually going to order another pair or two, but the first pair I purchased had a small hole in the seam on the 'rear end'.  It appeared to have never been sewn, and it certainly wasn't because of the way I put them on, or they were too small, etc.  It had never been sewn.  I really like the look and feel, though.",4
B075JTR46M,"Standard sweat pants fair. The AI collected review was right, they are tight in the hips. They almost feel like a tight pair of Wranglers (or other skinny jeans). Definitely puts a lot of pressure on the inseam, where I am positive there first hole will appear. That's why 4 instead of 5 stars",4
B075JTR46M,My father is in a wheelchair and needed a cream medication applied to his knees. These are amazing for the warmth layer while making it possible to apply the medication. 2 thumbs up.,5
B075JTR46M,"Great price, they fit great and seem like they will last as long as more expensive sweatpants,  I would buy these again.",5
B075JTR46M,Exactly as advertised. Totally satisfied with the fit.,5
B075JTR46M,great fabric.  Fits as described,5
B075JTR46M,Fit is exactly as expected! Soft and very warm! Don't think twice about buying a pair of these sweat pants!,5
B075JTR46M,Decent value. I would buy again,4
B075JTR46M,Thick and good quality and fit,5
B075JTR46M,"I purchased this along with the matching top. Couldn't be happier! During the past 6 months, I've been trying to find a sweat suit that fit properly & was warm but not too much. I'm 6'1' 195 lbs. Every other set I purchased had something I didn't like. Legs and/or arms too short. Polyester that is cold when first wearing on chilly mornings. A good value. This ""Amazon Essentials"" brand is exactly what I've been searching for while wasting money on others. It is a medium thickness. Not so heavy & thick like the expensive Nike one I have. This is the first set where the leg & arm lengths are long enough so I don't look as if I'm wearing ""high waters."" ;-) I'll be purchasing another color. Can't imagine anyone not liking these.",5
B075JTR46M,"I ordered a pair of these for my husband, says Amazon Basics.... when they showed up the were Under Armor, with a tag, but a small dirt spot on them????  Kept them because they fit and seem unused.  Just very strange",4
B075JTR46M,My husband was staying in hospital for two weeks so I bought this open at bottom pants for him.  He likes it then I bought another one for him.,5
B075JTR46M,The color is great. And so was the price,5
B075JTR46M,"I purchased these for my son, who does not like wearing long pants, and he said these are his favorite pants.  They are nicely made & not too tight fitting & not too hot to wear",5
B075JTR46M,No cuffs,4
B075JTR46M,"I've been out of the sweatpants game for a long time.  My first pair I'd ever owned was made by Balance.  They did it right.  Even a size small had plenty of stretch, a long enough drawstring, and fit, I dare say, perfect.  Now I'm trying several different brands and,  to my surprise, a store brand that costs half of name brand is putting the D in design.These are the perfect style for what's currently out there(at least what's showing on Amazon's  search results and it's draining trying to go through pages of crap you don't want.).  They are thick like sweatpants should be.  They don't have a back pocket(who needs a back pocket in 2024 when you can tap to pay.  Not everyone shops at WinCo.).  The pockets are very spacious with no uncomfortable zippers and I can fit a kindle with room to spare.  The fit is great on the rear and moving in any way offers plenty of coverage with no snags in the knees.  And finally, it comes with a drawstring that is long enough that you can tie it.",5
B075JTR46M,"I purchased a few different  sweatpants from different companies and the ones from ""Amazon Essentials Men's Fleece Open Bottom Sweatpant""  for $19.00 are outstanding. The quality, fit, comfort, and especially the draw string is superior to all the others. Will definitely buy more of this same brand for now on",5
B075JTR46M,great fabric. The pockets are too short. They won't securely hold a walut or standard sized phone. Pockets need another 1 inch length,4
B075JTR46M,"i bought too big, but didn't want the hassle of return/exchange",5
B075JTR46M,Nice fit and color. Soft on the inside and minimal shrinking.,5
B075JTR46M,Ok,4
B075JTR46M,"Really nice sweat pants. Good quality and comfort, however the tag in the rear elastic becomes irritating if worn for a few hours. I'm trying to decide if I should try to remove it or if I might make it worse...Do others have this issue?",4
B075JTR46M,"If you have a big ""posterior"" and big thighs these are perfect for you. Unfortunately, myself at 375-380 pounds I'm almost all fat gut, with comparative bird legs. But they are SO comfortable and warm for around the house, I just Love them. They do fit the waist too though. Nice and long also. A 6x IS a generously full 6X. So bare that in mind when/if you purchase a pair or 2. I bought a second pair at 5x size and it's perfect for me! I like them both immensely, for different usage!",5
B075JTR46M,Nothing to dislike,5
B075JTR46M,"I must say I am happy with these sweat pants. I got size XXL and They fit fine. I am 6'8"" with an athletic build and they fit well. My inseam is 36"" and these sweats are 34"" inseam. But because they rest just below my hips they hang just right. For the price I can't beat it. Didn't want to spend 30 to 40 plus dollars on sweats that I am just going to be wearing around my home on chilly days and evenings. The stitching and seams looked well done and it has a nice fleece lining on the inside. They're 35% cotton and 65% polyester, so they shouldn't shrink much if at all. I am going to get 2 more colors. This was a good buy for me.",5
B075JTR46M,"Nice quality, very comfortable",5
B075JTR46M,I bought one size larger but didn't need to as they are a little big but great for lounging around the house.,5
B075JTR46M,"1st impression:I am not easily satisfied when it comes to clothing that I cannot try on before I buy. Like in the box stores.However, this Fits as expected. Quality is fine. The package was delivered on time, as described on the site and as of this writing wearing properly and without any issues. If anything goes wrong in the near future I will update this review. (I will be ordering more of this exact item provided the current one holds up after 5 washing cycles)Received 12-19-24 - Purchased 2nd pair - same review applies - all is wellReceived 12-19-24 - Purchased 3rd pair - same review applies - all is well",5
B075JTR46M,"I use these for work, they're a very good quality, comfortable and durable. I wash them 5+ times a week for the past few weeks and have not had any issues with them.The comfort is great and the band is loose which makes it great when sitting for long period of time.",5
B075JTR46M,"Please get these! The most comfortable sweats ever! They are not cuffed at the bottom, the pockets are pretty good and they will definitely last you!",5
B075JTR46M,Great,5
B075JTR46M,"These are wonderful sweatpants, way better than the name brand I've always bought. They are heavier, really keep your legs warm when the wind blows. Wash and dry fantastic, no shrinkage, fading or color running. They run true to size with other brands.",5
B075JTR46M,good enuf,5
B075JTR46M,"Bought for my husband as a gift.  He is very difficult to buy for because of his size.  These pants fit him perfect, look great and are good quality.  Very happy with this purchase.  Great deal.",5
B075JTR46M,These are great value and feel nice. They are pretty plain but that's ok for the price.I usually wear a 33 inseam and medium is a bit longer than that it seems.,4
B075JTR46M,These sweatpants are good quality and nicely made. The only caution is that they seem to run small. Needed to return for a larger size.,4
B075JTR46M,"Nice pants, but the drawstring could be a little longer.",4
B075JTR46M,I like how comfortable these are but they could be longer in length,4
B075JTR46M,"Very comfortable. But after using them for a year or so, they started sliding down even when I tied the ties fairly tight. I fixed that: after washing them, I put them in a hot dryer to shrink them a little. Also I sewed a big zig-zag pattern on the waist band with my sewing machine and that helped, too. I would buy these again.",4
B075JTR46M,Lounging,4
B075JTR46M,"The material is good quality, fit and finish is very good.",5
B075JTR46M,"Like it all, just got send a big of a size to big, on the waist.",4
B075JTR46M,The last 2 of these pants i bouggt were very warm to wear. This order the pants are not. Very disappointed.,5
B075JTR46M,These are the best thing I bought on Amazon. The quality is far superior to all the other sweats I've purchased. They are warm and the fit is perfect. Well done Amazon Essentials.,5
B075JTR46M,"I loved the style and very good quality. Nice and thick and cozy. Just a bit long for my dad who is 5'9"". Will buy these again in a different color. Very happy with them.",5
B075JTR46M,These sweatpants are a great fit love the length on them and the straight leg bottoms. They go over my shoes great. I will be buying the rest of the colors soon.,5
B075JTR46M,My daughter loved thdm.,5
B075JTR46M,Super comfy and they fit me so well I don't even need to use the drawstring. I liked them so well I bought a 2nd pair. I may buy a 3rd. The neon burn-your-eyes-out green ones are calling my name...,5
B075JTR46M,"Previously I had purchased 2 other pairs- blue and black.  They fit perfectly 2X Large.  I really liked them so I purchased another pair Charcoal Heather and the waist band on this charcoal heather pair was/is at least 3+inches larger than the previous ones I purchased.  I really like the two previous ones, but this one pair really does not fit at all.  Same size etc.  Obviously size can vary quite a bit.  I must have been lucky on the first two pairs.  Not so lucky on this last pair.",3
B075JTR46M,"I've been buying Amazon Essential sweatpants and sweatshirts for years and happy with the products.But I had to add this review because of the very much improved pants and shirts fabric, fit and comfortability! The material has a much better ""hand"" than before and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I'll be buying more of both.",5
B075JTR46M,"I bought 2 pair of these pants in diff colors, both medium. The light grey ones are at least 2 inches longer that the dark grey size medium and a little bigger in the legs and waist. Much closer to the size large that I returned. Very comfortable though.",3
B075SGYNLT,"My wife bought this for me for a gift...and I've never been a ""robe guy."" I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was and how much I'd really been missing. LOL. I'm 6' and it is plenty long, the sleeves are slightly longer than my arms, which is nice. The cuffs are sewn in and add a nice touch.There's a couple small pockets and a tie. As big as I am, it fit around my waist, to my shock.Seriously a comfortable robe to fall asleep on the couch wearing. Not too hot nor bulky. I tried a snuggie before but the material was way different than this.Glad my wife gave it a shot. Good quality, very impressed!",5
B075SGYNLT,"Firstly,  Amazon shipping was very quick, I honestly don't know how they're able to offer what others cannot even come close to.I needed an extra bathrobe as I have 3 German Shepherds and they tend to shed a lot and I am always getting dog hair on my bathrobe. I was skeptical of a bathrobe being of high quality for under $20.00. I am not one easily impressed but Holy Cow ! The bathrobe is incredible, so much so that I went back to Amazon, just to check if I actually paid more than the advertised price. The price was $19.99 with free shipping, who does that ? Its size was actually a tad larger which is great in case I am wearing a sweatshirt underneath, very soft, warm and it's got a hood to boot ! I am not a cheap person but I know a great thing when I see it and if any of my close friends and family are reading this feedback, it won't come as a surprise, as to what I'll be getting you all for Christmas !",5
B075SGYNLT,"I like an oversized robe. Like wrapping up in a huge blanket. This did not disappoint. The color, fit, style, quality, and comfy softness of this robe is ON POINT. And, at a great price! I instantly loved it as soon as I put it on. I would definitely recommend it.",5
B075SGYNLT,"I got this for my dad and he loves it. Very soft, warm, and comfy. However, it did not come with a belt to tie the robe closed. Thankfully, we were able to find something in the house that worked for it. Seems like a huge hassle to send it back just for that. But be aware, make sure you take it out of the package first if you're giving it as a gift.",4
B075SGYNLT,"Replacement product arrived very timely and was a perfect  exchange from the original damaged and wrong size robe to a correct sized. great fit, style, color, soft and comfy robe. Washed and dried to perfection.",5
B075SGYNLT,"I got this for my boyfriend- he loves it! He loves how soft it is and that it has a hood. He also likes the length. He's 6' and it hits mid calf. Great quality, has pockets and it's super warm! Also holds up well in the wash!",5
B075SGYNLT,"Oh man, I love everything about it, style, comfort, material, color, size you name it, it's just great, I'm going to buy one for my wife and two daughters.",5
B075SGYNLT,"this is a mid-weight robe, very soft, feels great but not that heavyweight plush that is somewhat implied by the advertising.  As to fit ....  I'm a 6', 175# guy and the L/XL was HUGE on me.  I reordered a S/M and am very pleased with the fit.  However, once you remove it from the vacuum-packed sleeve, there's no getting it back into the original packaging for returns.",5
B075SGYNLT,This robe is super soft. I love the feel! It will keep you very warm. I start sweating if I wrap it around too much. I actually need to leave it a little loose for some airflow. The hood is great. I can keep my head (and ears) warm as well. The wine color is a nice deep red. The black accents are a classy touch. I would recommend trying this one!,5
B075SGYNLT,"I got this for my boyfriend who is 6'2 235. I got the 2x-3x so it fit oversized, and it does! He loves it and said it's really comfortable. I ended up buying myself one too because I like the oversized feel/look ( I'm 5'8 200+)",5
B075SGYNLT,"Because of the reviews I've read about this robe I got two one for my hubby and one for me. LOVE this Robe! It arrives all compact in a small box..(What?)  then I washed them asap (because that's what I do) and the outcome SO FLUFFY, So Comfy...Lightweight yet COZY! We Love the pockets and the hood... and for the price? It's a no brainer. LOVE THIS ROBE! My hubby LOVES this robe!",5
B075SGYNLT,"Not sure how much I'll use the hood when I'm healthy, but it will be perfect when I'm fighting a cold or flu.  Almost daily use for several weeks now, and it definitely keeps me warm, whether seated or standing.  It's much more than a bathrobe!",5
B075SGYNLT,"Bought six of these, all different sizes) for a bunch of my friends to wear as uniforms for a hockey tournament and I'm super impressed! It was in the negatives at said tourney and they stayed very warm and are super durable! Sooooo soft too. They do run slightly big though",5
B075SGYNLT,"Better than i had expected. I bought this for my 15 year old grandson who complains about everything, but he like this robe. Yeah....",4

B075SGYNLT,"This is a wonderful style, fit, not heavy, and love the hood",5
B075SGYNLT,"I haven't seen a better plush bathrobe for less. Warm enough to wear with only undies out on the back porch in cool weather (not freezing though).  The artificial fabric feels weird when you're damp from a shower, but great when you're fully dry.",5
B075SGYNLT,soft warm and very comfortable,5
B075SGYNLT,"Very pleased with how warm it keeps me. I can walk out in subfreezing temps wearing just this to quickly go grab something outside and never get cold. With the hood and pockets, it's a gem.",5

B075SGYNLT,"Great robe, washes well",5
B075SGYNLT,"This thing is super soft and long. 5'8"" and goes down to just above my ankles. Hood is great and warm on the head. Been cold this winter and this warms you right up.",5
B075SGYNLT,"Got this for my BF who never used a robe before!  He LOVES it, it looks great and it is so very soft!!",5
B075SGYNLT,"Bought this for my husband to use when going outside to our hot tub.  We live in Michigan and it's darn cold in the late fall/winter. Our hot tub is under our uninsulated gazebo.  Silly guy was just wrapping a towel around himself.  Bought this and he loves it. He's 5'7"", and this comes down past his knees.  Sleeves are a great length.  Pockets are handy for his phone to stay safe . It's not super thick but definitely has enough weight to keep him warm.  Just the standard tie closure which is totally sufficient.  Only washed it once so far but held up well. Can't even tell we washed it.",5
B075SGYNLT,"When I opened the box I thought it was going to be a cheap thin robe, but they vacuum pack it and once open it is a fantastic robe.  It is everything in the description.  I got the large and it is plenty of material, the robe tie has plenty of length.  Would purchase again.",5
B075SGYNLT,"If you're looking to buy a dressing gown, then this is the  item for you.",5

B075SGYNLT,"I was a little wary of the ""S/M"" sizing since I wear a medium in everything, but the robe was plenty roomy.I can wear it over my clothes when I am chilled in the house. I like the hood too for keeping warm. The fleecy material is high quality and seems durable. It's a great value for the price.",5

It's well-made, and looks really nice. He loves the hood (especially after a shower with a wet head) and deep pockets. And black and grey is his favorite color combo. A winner!",5
B075SGYNLT,Very pleased with this purchase.,5
B075SGYNLT,"Not too thick, not too thin, long enough to fit my 6'2"" tall son.",5

B0B62HGK2H,Was perfect for our football game! We ordered them for the color and they were thick too! Perfect orange for the game and kept us dry for the most part! Good buy and did the job ! Loved the oversized fit too.,5
B0B62HGK2H,Love the quality of the material. Definitely dries well and folds up into a small pouch. Really great for theme parks.,5
B0B62HGK2H,Easy to pack in a suitcase. Sturdy and easy to put back in bag. Hangs easily on a hanger in closet to dry. Kept me dry during rainy days. Long enough to cover butt when seated. Good value. Love the orange color,5
B0B62HGK2H,"I ordered two of these for a work event and I needed something super bright orange in a pinch. The price is great and the color is perfect, BUT I received an XXL and a L. I thought these were one size? Beware if you do order, they send random sizes (which is why some people reported them getting super small ponchos that barely fit them). The XXL fits like a large and the ""large"" size could probably fit a child. We'll still use them as we needed something ASAP but, I wanted to give people who are looking to purchase a heads up.",3
B0B62HGK2H,makes being in the rain comfortable and dry if you don't want to hold an umbrella.  rolls up into a nice carry pouch that can fit in your backpack easily.,5
B0B62HGK2H,"Nice product but not very tough. It's fine if you are a gentle person, but would not recommend it for rough work wear. it is totally waterproof, but seems like it may rip easily.",4
B0B62HGK2H,I walk to work. Regardless of any weather. This time it happened to be a downpour. It was perfect for it. My clothes were more dryer when I arrived. I say it served its purpose and it will for many years to come. It fit nice over my coat and booking like I hoped.,5
B0B62HGK2H,fits very well for a big and tall man 2xlt or 3xlt,5
B0B62HGK2H,"I liked it. It is really useful on rainy days. You have access to your clothes while you wear it. However, it has some weaknesses: The sleeves are a little short, which makes it wet, and the hat doesn't have enough space to adjust, and I have some difficulty adjusting the hat to cover my head.",4
B0B62HGK2H,"This item was a gift to my sister, and she loved it. To me, that ranks five stars!",5
B0B62HGK2H,"Excellent, great Pancho",5

B0B62HGK2H,Sith cover at a budget,5
B0B62HGK2H,"POST TRIP REVIEW:  The poncho held up really well.  It dried off quickly.  Unfortunately we had a number of occasions to use it.  This was in Italy and I can add an observation:  Only tourists use these.  The natives use umbrellas. I'm still glad I brought it.  As a tourist, I wanted both hands free and to keep my backpack dry without effort.  While my tourist status was loud and clear to pick pockets, I had a travel purse for all my valuables.  It worked for me.  Some people prefer the waist band money belt.  Everything below still holds true:ORIGINAL REVIEW:  First off, some reviews spoke of a really bad smell.  This had no smell, which is great.  I ran water over it in the sink and the water beaded and rolled right off.  Some reviews said that it lost its waterproof feature over time.  It that happens on our trip, I will update.  However, I only got this for one trip.  If it's in good shape I'll save it for the theoretical next vacation.  I'm hoping to not need it.  The bill of the cap is not stiff but it probably gives some coverage if you are wearing it w/a baseball style cap.  The neck has a proper cinch feature which is essential in the rainThis is not a fashion raincoat, it's a big square poncho that will keep you and your backpack dry in the rain (I hope).  It's ""one size fits all"" and I'm ordering a second one for my husband (I'm 5'7"" and he is 5'11"").  We are both medium build but it could also work for plus size folks.",5
B0B62HGK2H,Heavier than the cheap plastic ones on the Maid of the Mist,4
B0B62HGK2H,Excelente material y practica para alamcenar,4
B0B62HGK2H,I like and the material is good. I have several different ones and I bought this one for the safety ( orange and stripes ) and put in my car .,5
B0B62HGK2H,Bought for land scaper.,5
B0B62HGK2H,I love the color. I wear this poncho when I have to walk the dog. It definitely keeps me dry.,5
B0B62HGK2H,"You never know what the weather will do in Houston. With rain threatening our outdoor concert fun, I grabbed these as a just in case. Best decision I made all month. We stayed dry until the storm passed and the band went on.These are NOT thin cheap plasticy material, and easily as nice as other windbreakers in my closet. Being able to unbutton the side to slide the wet poncho off is clutch. The bags included fit a wet poncho no problem even if you just cram it in.Easy recommendation here.",5
B0B62HGK2H,Exactly what I was looking for. Durable,5
B0B62HGK2H,Thanks for your business,5
B0B62HGK2H,"Used for the first time when arrived to vote & had to stand in the rain waiting in line. The bag is great. Easy to open, easy to put the folded poncho back it. It's got some wiggle room. Got orange so it would be easily seen. Not the thickest thing ever, but it's great for when you need it.",5
B0B62HGK2H,Arrived on time and sturdy.,5
B0B62HGK2H,"kept me dry,  but the reflective stuff fell off",4
B0B62HGK2H,Was good for price but I my friend is short so it was too long for her,4
B0B62HGK2H,Put it to use shortly after receiving it at a football game. Kept me nice and dry. Was very glad I had it with me.,5
B0B62HGK2H,It does work however I couldn't even slip the hood back off my head the hole for the face is way to small. So all in all not very practical but in a pinch I will use it.,3
B0B62HGK2H,The color is as pictured and is a nice lightweight rain coat. Careful if your hiking and climbing its easy to catch underneath your feet. The only thing that would make this 5 stars if there was a bigger hole for head.,4
B0B62HGK2H,"If you live in Texas, you know the rain comes from every direction. Ot's great to have your hands free and your bags covered under the cape. It just needs a little bigger opening for the head, so your ponytail can get through easily.",4
B0B62HGK2H,"Bag broke rather quickly, but the poncho works well for commuting around campus and not having to carry around the weight of an umbrella.",4
B0B62HGK2H,"cool productit' s got a 'one size fits most' design, but I'm a big guy and it's just a bit narrow for meWearable but not as roomy as i'd hopedlove the reflector bands and the color!",4
B0B62HGK2H,"Wore this on the Camino trail last week.  Rained every day, but poncho kept me and my backpack dry.  The hood with visor was comfortable and wind proof.  The flame orange was highly visible and cheery on the trail!",5
B0B62HGK2H,"I needed something for the rain but also something I can easily put fabric letters on.  This thing works great!  I would advise being careful with it...  Don't pull or cause it to stretch because the material while strong enough, is not made of steel.  Probably will rip if not handle with care.Some people complained about the hole your head goes through but my head went through with no issues.  I guess it depends on the size of your head and not really the fault of the Poncho.I do wish it was less ""floaty"" with wind but all in all, works just fine.",5
B0B62HGK2H,,5
B0B62HGK2H,"For reference I am 5 foot 2, close to 200 pounds. I do like this poncho, it is very large on me, goes down to the middle of my shins, which adds more protection from the rain. The sleeves aren't as long, so if I am wearing a sweatshirt because it isn't cold enough to wear my winter coat, my sleeves get very soaked, especially if I am pushing my cart or my dog stroller. The hood is very big and unfortunately prevents me from seeing much in front of me when walking in the pouring down rain and I have tried to pull it back a little bit so I can see but it quickly moves back to where I can't see again and I end up taking the hood all the way off so that I can navigate where I am going. Overall I am happy with my purchase but I do wish I could see with the hood on, that would make the walk a lot more comfortable.",4
B0B62HGK2H,These are very nice quality and compact I've purchased several of these for storeages for different activities. One for the kayak one for the motorcycle and one for the glove box... never hurts to be prepared.,5
B0B62HGK2H,"Hurricane season is still on going, and thus it hasn't let me down. It is big enough for someone my size (6ft -ish, 240 lbs) carrying a bagpack with a laptop and bunch of expensive books. Anything and everything above my knee, even in the middle of a tropical storm, was dry as bone.Rating: 9.3/10.",5
B0B62HGK2H,This poncho runs large and is not as compact as I had hoped.,3
B0B62HGK2H,"Good quality and the XL fits well. I'm 6'2"" and 250 lbs, and it fits perfectly. The deep blue is more of a deep purple. Fine with me, as I'm a Vikings fan, but not the blue as shown on Amazon website.",4
B0B62HGK2H,Perfect and protected us from the New York rain and I love that it came in a pouch / bag it was amazing and easy to carry around when we wet .,5
B0B62HGK2H,"Hey, these worked. It only rained the one day we were there so nice that they were compact. Better than raincoats because could cover over bags",5
B0B62HGK2H,"This is nice,  comfortable,  durable and works great. Light fit and cozy. I'm 5 foot 1 and weigh 250 lbs. It fits me. It would also fit someone smaller and even bigger.",5
B0B62HGK2H,The hooded rain poncho was exactly as presented upon arrival! It is long and large. Should serve me well in the rainforest!,4
B0B62HGK2H,Material un poco fino pero cubre,4
B0B62HGK2H,Kept me warm and dry. Did not fly around. The visor on the hood was perfect. And it folded up perfectly back into the pouch,5
B0B62HGK2H,Loved the color and softer water resistance material.,5
B0B62HGK2H,"Wore this poncho at a concert where it was POURING rain. not only did i remain totally dry, but the little brim on the hood kept the rain off my face as well. As I looked around at other people getting soaked in the cheap plastic ponchos that I almost purchased, i was very happy I spent the extra money on this much better poncho. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",5
B0B62HGK2H,"Packs small, light.  It's comfortable and has been perfect for our travels.",5
B0B62HGK2H,Came quick and is a good product,5
B0B62HGK2H,Not the product but the delivery was one day after being informed.,4
B0B62HGK2H,it's a little bit stinky but otherwise all is good.,4
B0B62HGK2H,Perfect,5
B0B62HGK2H,I really like this poncho. It is nice and light. This packs down nice and small.,4
B0B62HGK2H,"I got this to try something different from my typical frogtoggs poncho and it's quite alright. I've had a frogtogg for several years and it has held up, surprisingly. Considering that high-end ponchos can easily cost $100, I'll give this poncho 5 stars if it lasts -- price considered. Definitely a good backup regardless. Recommended.",5
B0B62HGK2H,"room to spare. I was hesitant to buy this because there's no size given and I'm a plus size guy 3x. I bought it anyway and I had no problem getting into it. Matter of fact there's enough room to keep another average sized person dry, that is if it's as water replacement as some of y'all say. We'll see and I'll report back.",5
B0B62HGK2H,Good,5
B0B62HGK2H,Excellent,5
B0B62HGK2H,Love that you can just throw it on and ride,5
B0B62HGK2H,Got this for a Labor Day camping trip in WV. It rained 2 out of the 3 days there and this was perfect! Kept me dry and it was easy to compactly pack up for travel.,5
B0B62HGK2H,It is handy when rain comes,4
B0B62HGK2H,"Lots of material.  Covers body, allows ease of movement.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,The shirts are comfortable and the quality is good. But they are longer and slightly wider than most other brands.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,"was skeptical at first for 5 polo shirts for under $50.I needed a set of casual polo shirts to wear for work and figured these would do.To my surprise, these shirts fit pretty well.  I may have to go an extra size (size XXL) next time I order these as they fit great, but I would prefer a slight looser fit.  If you're a stocky guy like me (5'9"" and 225 lbs)  these shirts will fit a little tight.  So it's best to go 1 size over your normal size.  If you work out regularly, these shirts will make you look good highlighting your physical features.These shirts are fitted from top to bottom, which is cool because they dont hang loose on the bottom.  You can wear them tucked in or untucked and they fit very well untucked.  They are also good for warm weather as the material is breathable so you dont sweat in them as much.Can't beat this deal for 5 shirts under $50!  Well worth it.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"These are thin for comfort in warmer weather. The quality is excellent. They offer a nice color selection. Do the math when looking at the price per shirt and youll see that these shirts are a steal! No ironing needed. I like my shirts to have a collar in any weather as these do. Highly recommend these, don't hesitate!",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Great quality look and feel.  Have not washed yet but shouldn't be an issue.  Plan to buy more in other colors.  More people should buy these and less t-shirts. #dressbetter,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Great fabric quality, true fit, perfect for warmer weather or for layers, and the colors are compatible with those in product photo",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"These shirts feel amazing! The delivery was quick and they fit the casual to formal spectrum of clothing, and the are amazing fabric so in the hot sun in Florida, these are perfect!!",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,My son in law needed dress down shirts but they needed to look nice. These are great!,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Nice quality and fit!!,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"The shirts fit nicely, and made of a lightweight material so they feel good during the hotter days.",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,Bought as Christmas present for my dad! He loved it and threw all his other shirts away! He said they are comfortable!,5

B0B1TK5BZZ,Me encanto el polo se ajusta bien y se ve que es de muy buen material. La entrega fue en la fecha prevista. Todo excelente,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"**Real review,** straight to the point. Overall, Great shirts for the money. However, ifYour looking forms fitted shirt, I would size down. I bought an XL 5-pack, but I would highly to size down for a tighter, more fitted feel.",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,Very nice quality and sizing is  spot-on!  I would reorder this product without hesitation!,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,This was bought for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loved this!!,5

It keeps me cool and dry!",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,Nicely cool fitted shirts,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,These are great quality polos. For the price you can't beat it!,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,They do the job and look pretty decent for just a work polo.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,You cannot beat the look and the quality for the price.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Great colors, true size",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,"I bought a pack of Telaleo shirts before that were great! Soft fabric, breathable and moisture wicking, so I bought this pack of shirts to replace my cotton polos, but this pack of shirts is not moisture wicking. They just absorb the moisture like a cotton shirt. Still comfortable, but not as nice as the previous pack of shirts.",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,My son started playing golf and like most 15 year old kids they only have tshirts.  Light weight and great for golf.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Rim a little small perfect for summer,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,I ordered a 2xl set and they were really tight on me. I fit in most 2xl shirts so I was a bit surprised. Quality was good. These shirts are good for hot weather as they are breathable.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,My husband loved the shirts,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"This shirt is perfect for hot weather.It keeps me cool while I play golf under the summer sun.Even when I sweat, the sweat just dries away because of the thin material.",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,Quality shirts with spot on sizing,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"The shirts arrive well packaged, but in a zip lock translucent bag with a shipping label. The bag was opened a little when received but that wasn't a major issue coming from an Amazon truck. The length was nice, the material sturdy, and the colors crisp. I have worn a few, they fit well and were a good purchase.",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,AWesome value for basic business and casual shirts,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,As described,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Fit great, felt great but make sure you go up one size. Great deal. Would order again",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Material was thick, but not to thick, great color, size was perfect, held up perfect during washing.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Exactly as described. Great for work shirts or branded giveaways. I'll be ordering again.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Great plus and color assortment.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,These are really nice shirts. Very well made but kind of tight fit. Bought a 3 x size because I like a loose fix but are more of a size 2x or even smaller.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,"My husband loves the shirts, however, 1 (the black one) of the 5 was a medium, and I ordered a Large.  Overall the material is breathable and what he needed for work. Wish they were a little bit longer.",4
B0B1TK5BZZ,They are good quality but run a little short and snug.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Fit well, very comfortable",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Beautiful shirts. My only issue was that the shirts were a little smaller than the expected XL shirts I wear.  Luckily I lost some weight so they fit fine.  Shirts were a little hard to get unwrinkled.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,"The quality that you get for the cost is incredible. I wear polos almost daily for work and these were great to extend my rotation. These are just as well made as my new era, under Armour, and Nike polos. Would buy again!",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Wash and dry very well,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Camisetas bonitas, para trabajo o salidas casuales.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"I do not usually review products unless they impress me.  I typically believe you get what you pay for, but so far that is not true with these shirts.  They fit and feel better then expected.Only washed and dried 3 times so far, but no snags, wear, shrinkage, collar stretch, or weaken elastic (all things that I have had happen from higher end/more expensive dry fit shirts).If they had more color options that I liked, I would buy again.  Will update in the future if my opinion changes at all on these shirts.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"I got the medium 5 pack. The quality is very good and all shirts are a medium. The length is perfect for me, although I use shirt stays to really get a good fitted tuck into my pants. The material is great but the shape of my nipples are visible due to the material. This is easily mitigated by wearing an under shirt.Very happy with this product.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Great fit, light weight.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Muy buena calidad,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"I like colors , fabric feel and colors and priceOnly laundered once but the appear to be easy maintenance",4

B0B1TK5BZZ,Feels light,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Bought these shirts for my boyfriend. The shirts fit him perfectly and run true to size. He can wear them almost anywhere and look quite nice. I hang them to dry and don't need an iron afterwards. He loves wearing them and is extremely comfortable.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,These shirts are pretty cheap for what you get. They fit well in the arms and shoulders and aren't 10 miles of bagginess at the waist.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Camisas muy buenas y de buena calidad,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Good material and very comfy,5

B0B1TK5BZZ,Great quality shirts for the price,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Quality was great.  I have worn each of them two times and washed them two times.  Fit is good.  Fabric is cool and comfortable as advertised.  Would buy again.,4
B0B1TK5BZZ,Nice shirts and great quality for my husband to work in,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"The material is awesome, providing some cooling to the skin without coming at the cost of a professional look. I have a narrow neck, so there is a but of a sloppy look around the collar unless I button them all the way up, but that is a me issue, and not a knock on the shirts. All shirts were consistently sized and have held color and quality after several times worn and washed",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Just as comfortable as the name brands for a lot cheaper. Thin fabric and fit great.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"These are really nice shirts for the money. I sold cars for like two weeks and they wanted me to buy their shirts at like 50 bucks a clip. We average 100 bucks a car sale, so they could forget that. I bought these and they worked well and are nearly as nice as some name brand polos I have. Great for the summer.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,I like the sturdiness. The people I gave then to really liked it,3
B0B1TK5BZZ,I really like them.I order the wrong size.  I need large.  Need to return them and exchange them.  Same shirts just large size.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Nice long fit to lengthen your torso. Good sweat proof without feeling to silky or shimmery. Will buy more.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,For everyday there amazing thank you,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Ordered these not expecting much. Happy to report that these fit really well and seem to be of good quality. Definitely would recommend.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Great value for the money.  Like the fit and feel of the polo shirts.  More conforming in shoulders and arms but have a nice flex.  Wish they came in more colors but these are good for a base.  Seem to be better quality, no issues with stitching or anything like buttons coming loose. Overall, happy with purchase.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"It is like announced, size M is as expected, and quality is good for the price.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Wanted something light and comfortable for summer time golf in FLHad a lot of golf shirts but they all were to tight. These fit so nicely.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"These are great slim fit shirts. The fabric is nice on the thinner side, doesn't wrinkle, and great for men that are muscular and like a more fitted look. These are fabulous!",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,"Shirts are very nice looking, collars hold their shape. Fabric is soft.",5
B0B1TK5BZZ,Numerous compliments at the gym and elsewhere.,5
B0B1TK5BZZ,These seemed like a deal and so I bought the 5 pack. They were sized right and have NOT shrunk after washing. They are not overly thick and they are not see-through. A little stretchy and comfy. They seem to be wrinkle free and I may buy more soon. Go good with my slacks or jeans. I like them a lot.,5
B0874W4WR5,My husband loves these. Great quality material. Super comfortable fit. Just the right length. Great value and super fast shipping. Very functional shirts. Just the right weight and a sharp look. Nice shirts for sure.,5
B0874W4WR5,"These are really comfortable and provide the doctor-recommended compression I actually need due to an injury. I tried some less expensive compression shorts I bought on Amazon, but they did not fit nearly as well. I returned them, then tried these Under Armour shorts. Paid more but great decision. What a difference. Also, appreciate the pocket, perfect for my mobile phone. This is a case of, you get what you pay for.",5
B0874W4WR5,If you like snug no no math this is for you. Love the color. Material is soft enough. Mixed. Not cotton. Kind of expensive.,4
B0874W4WR5,"I've worn compression shorts for about 30 years now, to help prevent hamstring cramps during lengthy sessions of competitive volleyball or pickleball.  These Under Armor compression shorts are the best I've found.  They fit well, have a supportive pouch, provide good thigh compression, and have lasted through many wearings and washings.  I now own 3 pair.",5
B0874W4WR5,I like the way they fit well and hold your family jewels in place. The quality of compression short is made well and the stitching is not going to fall apart. Plus the sale price was good deal.,5
B0874W4WR5,Pocket size is perfect for my phone. Very durable and good value for the money. I love these.,5
B0874W4WR5,Under Armour is a quality name.  The item was new and as described.....it was a gift and the receiver was well pleased....,5
B0874W4WR5,This also helps a lot when running.,5
B0874W4WR5,My son loves these. He was having some major hip pain while playing soccer and his physical therapist recommended compression shorts. He is liking these but I feel they could do a little better on compression.,4
B0874W4WR5,I wear these to the gym and they are comfortable and not too revealing.,4
B0874W4WR5,Heavier than their underwear. Holds everything in place. Compression is good throughout.,5
B0874W4WR5,My husband loves these for working out.,5
B0874W4WR5,"I bought these as I needed something that would not only feel good, but compress to a certain degree and they are the best",5
B0874W4WR5,Best compression shorts that I have tried. Definitely more than I would like to spend on one pair... But I end up going through way more pairs of the other compression shorts I have bought. You definitely get what you pay for. These last me forever so I end up saving money. Great for gym/post gym.,5
B0874W4WR5,They fit well and are ok but every pair when it goes rips in the same spot. The outer edge of the seem on the left side of the crotch.,4
B0874W4WR5,Fit well and provide necessary support.  Wash well too!  Fits true to size.,5
B0874W4WR5,"These are the best undies I have ever purchased. Comfort, check. Quality, check. Performance, check. Good looking, check. I don't see how anyone can be disappointed. Keep looking for discounts, they come often.",5
B0874W4WR5,I have bought these a couple of times the fit is great they are comfortable and breathable the quality is excellent price was a little high but worth the money,5
B0874W4WR5,"Excellent fit, true to size. It has held up to many washes without fading or elastic degrading after over a year of one day a week use.",5
B0874W4WR5,They fit well and the cell phone pocket is very handy. I now have three!,5
B0874W4WR5,Durable good quality material for workouts.,5
B0874W4WR5,These are great shorts under a wetsuit or skin. Instant dry capability perfect for water sports.,5
B0874W4WR5,This item is good but it is expensive,4
B0874W4WR5,Excelente,5
B0874W4WR5,My jewels have never been so compressed,5
B0874W4WR5,I bought them for my husband. He is very pleased.,5
B0874W4WR5,"Ajuste perfecto, la mejor prenda para hacer ejercicio y guardar el celular",5
B0874W4WR5,"They work great as underwear, they feel great, supportive, breathable, and have a pocket which is good at the gym. Thr material is perfectly thin & thick in the right places, being thin where chafing occurs, and thick around the crotch for support. The problem with them as a short is that they define the crotch a bit too much, and are not squat-proof. I got these on sale for 7$ a piece, but I would just buy something else because 20$ for basically underwear is pushing it.",4
B0874W4WR5,They fit as they should have.  Plenty of compression and no bunching up.  Great and will buy again.,5
B0874W4WR5,"This is the gold standard, great for compression when running or playing sports!",5
B0874W4WR5,My husband likes them. We'll be buying them again. Good value for the money and they fit as expected.,5
B0874W4WR5,"They are compression, stay put and keep shape after washing.",5
B0874W4WR5,I would by underarmour again,5
B0874W4WR5,Fits great love the compression,5
B0874W4WR5,Good quality,4
B0874W4WR5,"I love compression shorts, but these came in a little too short, and there was no way of telling whether they go above the knee or not. There seems to be two lengths when it comes to these shorts and it would be nice to know if they are the longer length or the short length in the future",3
B0B2NYFR9D,"These socks were advertised to me and I really liked the look.  I have new walking shoes that ""eat"" my no show socks, so the ankle length works well.  They feel great on my feet and have been warm during the cold weather.  I wear them around the house, during yoga and under boots as well as when walking.  I wear women's shoes size 8.5 and ordered the Medium - perfect fit!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,I saw these on deal of the day and thought they looked funky and cool so I read the reviews.  They seemed great so I ordered them.  They are great quality and super comfortable.  I'll be ordering more soon,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very comfortable.  I bought another pair at the same rime that is mostly rayon and these feel much nicer and seem to be very durable so far.  Colors are nice.  Just enough pattern and variety to look nice without being too loud.,4
B0B2NYFR9D,"Well made, comfortable, loved the color combinations!  Definte yes for this product!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,They're a little taller than expected but they're also men's socks. They're comfortable and don't fall off. I bought 2 sets and will now be buying some for my husband. Great value for the price!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Perfect fit and very, very comfortable. I highly recommend this product.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I'm female, saw these were on sale, needed socks, didn't care they're mens. Not too thick, beautiful colors, very comfortable. I'm buying more. I think it's a great sock",5
B0B2NYFR9D,It took me awhile to decide to get these. I had seem them before but tried a couple traditio al brands instead. I wish I would have bought these a long time ago. I absolutely love them. They match just about anything g as well. Super comfort and your feet can really breathe in them.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I bought them for myself - woman, size 10W shoe.  I loved the patterns and the size of the sock.  I just don't see how these could fit over a man's foot comfortably.  Did I miss the size chart?  Anyway, for me they are my favorites in the sock drawer.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,The reviews are correct these are very comfortable socks that stretch to fit perfectly and they are easy to put on and take off.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I love these socks. They aren't super thick, like hiking socks, but they are thick enough to feel the comfort they provide and feel like they will last.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Great fit, stitching doesn't rub and they're not too warm so you're feet don't sweat overly and stay dry",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Colorful yesFit  yesPadded  noMidweight yes,4
B0B2NYFR9D,"These are the softest, warm and cutest socks ever! My boyfriend actually get lots of compliments on them too! Highly recommend them!!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Quality Socks are comfortable and nice to look at,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Oh I love these socks; they are so comfortable and very soft!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Much thicker than most socks.  Bottom extra thick. I will never purchase another brand.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very nice material and collors...,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Comfortable, colorful, good price for these socks.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I needed new socks for trail running and these were on sale and looked good so I purchased the xl (size 12-14) since I have a 13 foot. Received yesterday and tried a pair out and knew right away that they were very comfortable. Five stars for that. Now, will they hold up to harsh conditions on the trails? I hope so.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Just as good as Bombas and very cool colors.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Comfortable and still good after wash,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very comfortable and good fit. Happy with this purchase.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,great fit,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Good!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very comfortable. High quality. Washes well,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Fit and colors comfortable.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Son totalmente confortables .,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Love them they are so soft. I wear them around the house,4
B0B2NYFR9D,"Great socks, very comfy!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Great socks, great price.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,I just put a pair on. Great sox for the price. Ankle high and thick enough to make it great. Have more in my cart.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Great colors and material,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Loves these socks,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I have trouble with some socks.  They twist on me so the heel ends up on top of my foot, very annoying. Very pretty colors. I was looking for Bombas and got sidelined by the great colors. I gave them to my roommate, we have the same size feet, 13-14. I'm a 6'2"" female and he's a guy.",4
B0B2NYFR9D,"I have always had a hard time finding an ankle sock that actually stayed up, these are the perfect length.  They are also the perfect weight, not too heavy not too light.  Finally, they wick moisture remarkably well.  Great product.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very comfortable,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Great fut, really comfortable",5
B0B2NYFR9D,thankful that they are what was asked for and good quality and that they donate socks also.,4
B0B2NYFR9D,I was tired of the no show socks coming off my heel so I wanted to try quarter length sox.  Bingo.Bioaum were the perfit 'fit'.  They are so comfortable I don't even know they are on my feet.  I highly reccomend them to those who want their feet to feel elite.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,These are perfect!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Love these,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Great socks. I would buy them again.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Not what I had hoped for!  Inside of sock has different strings of thread that one's ""toes"" catch on which is annoying when one is in a rush, painful if one pulls on the sock and tangles when in the wash so there are NEW places to catch your toes.  They were not soft as the cotton percentage implied.  The size posted is not at all as described, these fit my wife better than me with a size 11 shoe size.  Would not purchase again.",3
B0B2NYFR9D,Hope they are cotton.,4
B0B2NYFR9D,Great ship time. Great customer service. Great socks!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Bought these because the previous socks I'd bought were giving me blisters. These fit great and seem to wick moisture away from the feet.  However,  I noticed when putting my shoes on today that there was a mat of material built up in the heel on my shoe.  Worried these are going to wear through in the coming weeks and months.",3
B0B2NYFR9D,Excellent quality and so comfortable.  Maybe order a larger size than usual.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I just recently purchased these Bioaum men's socks. I was looking for something just above the ankle. I also have the below ankle socks, which I purchased first...That's why I bought these. Very comfortable and durable. Great products!!!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,These sock fit well and seem well made. That said I'll reserve my final comments after I see how long it is before I get a hole in the heel. Until then I'm happy!!,4
B0B2NYFR9D,Great socks. Fit well and have fun colors!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Wash ability, good quality",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Not as much cushion as the ankle socks. I have both and these are thinner for sure.,3
B0B2NYFR9D,Great sock nice thick nice patterns looks good comrd fast!!,4
B0B2NYFR9D,"Love the socks, unfortunately 1 sock in each of the 3 pairs came with holes in them at the seam at the heel.",3
B0B2NYFR9D,"Gotta get some more of these socks- so comfy! I wear size 14 mens, and its hard to find nice looking socks that are durable and feel great in my size.  Good price too.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Not as much sock as described, just above the ankle. Otherwise soft, thick and breathable.",4
B0B2NYFR9D,I like the socks they fit well but they're not as thick as I expected them to be.,4
B0B2NYFR9D,Nothing overly special but they do hold up after multiple washes,4
B0B2NYFR9D,I wear them everyday.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,They fit and feel good on my feet. There warm.I think there good quality.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,In every way!!!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Awesome designs and super comfy!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,Great pair of socks the look n style n materiel are very nice,5
B0B2NYFR9D,comfortable they fit well cute gifts love them this is like the fourth time I've ordered them,5
B0B2NYFR9D,The package was super cute and the feel of the socks? A massage for your feet good.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I was a big believer and user of BOMBA -- these are 1/2 the price and feel great, and dont ride down in my sneaker at the gym.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Terrific color and quality. A little too warm for shorties,4
B0B2NYFR9D,I really like these socks. Normally socks fit me tight because my shoe size is 13 and socks fit 10-13. NOT! The is smooth so no rubbing of the toes. Over all they are great.,4
B0B2NYFR9D,"They were a good deal, vibrant colours, and don't get super dirty super quick unlike other socks I have.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,"I've got big feet - size 14 and it's hard finding a sock that fits well.  According to the label, these should fit my feet so I took a chance and ordered two boxes, twelve pairs total.They are very colorful - much more fun to wear than an all white or black sock and they fit very well.  For the price, I wasn't expecting that there would be much cushion in the socks, but again, they are thick enough to provide all the cushion I need.  I'm very happy with the purchase and will definitely buy more as they wear out.  Highly recommended!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very comfy socks. Like the colors and stitching. Seem to have just the right amount of cushioning. Like that they are a cotton blend also. Can't stand mostly polyester blend socks. Not sure how they would be for a long hike or run. Mostly just wear them everyday activities.,5
B0B2NYFR9D,I used to just buy Gold Toe socks all the time.. but that's done the quality that's going way down..these socks look great they fit correctly  are very comfortable and are inexpensive.. getting another box!,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"If feet can smile, mine are smiling with these socks.  They just arrived and I put them on. They feel soft but supportive and I really like the 'design/colors'. I ordered 3 boxes of these and will definitely buy more of these in the future.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Thick socks very comfortable and they are snug I wear a size 13 shoe and they fit perfect,5
B0B2NYFR9D,"Very nice! Just the right thickness - not too much, not too thin. HUGE bargain for the quantity and quality!!",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Nice but really ns small,3
B0B2NYFR9D,"The cotton-nylon-spandex blend feels good, medium weight.Fits over the ankle and stays there.Looks great.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,I really enjoy the colors of the set of socks. I also like that they have different sizing options. I chose a 10 to 13 because I have wide feet. Although they did shrink a little they still fit I might try the largest size to see how much shrinkage happens.,4
B0B2NYFR9D,"These are soft and high quality. I will be buying more of these, I love these socks plus the design is chic.",5
B0B2NYFR9D,Very comfortable.,5
B01MY10ZEG,After 8 months of wear they are holding up quite well. There is no damage to any of them and they're still close to new condition looks and feel wise. Moderate walking with work with occasional leisurely walks as far as use goes. Very comfortable and durable. Got tired of the local stores never having the sock style I wanted and I took a chance on these. I have wide feet so I can't just buy anything on the shelf and be comfortable. Best basic socks I've ever had and will buy again.,5
B01MY10ZEG,"I live and work outdoors in Florida.  Have always worn taller work boots.  Started wearing a low-cut work shoe from Red Wing.  These socks are excellent.  They provide the lower height to go with the lower cut work shoe but still supply the cushion you expect form a work sock.  Only complaint is that the elastic wears out before the sock, but it is such a minor complaint that I am on my third purchase of these socks.  Approximately 1 pack every 10-11 months.",5
B01MY10ZEG,My size 13's have found a comfortable home. Well made.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Good sturdy socks that fit well at a great price. A little too tight in the ankle even though I have slim ankles.,4
B01MY10ZEG,"Got these for my husband for work, they seem to hold up well, they are nice and thick so they last longer than most with his slip-on boots which tend to be harder on socks. I bought these for the high cotton content and have not been disappointed.  My husband likes the height  of these because they aren't tall but don't slide off either, they stay in place as they should",5
B01MY10ZEG,Seem to be very well made. Thick and comfortable.,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Soft, cushiony, warm, most comfortable socks my husband said he's ever worn",5
B01MY10ZEG,"These are really good short socks. Keep in mind that they are white cotton athletic socks and, as such, they are thicker than dress socks. If you want great thick short athletic socks, these fill the bill.",4
B01MY10ZEG,Great quality.  Feel good on my feet,5
B01MY10ZEG,Fit just right,5
B01MY10ZEG,I don't like to comment on items unless I have used them and put them to the test. The material is heavy duty. They are very well made. I have tried many name brands and these are holding up very well. They don't slide down your ankle or foot when walking or running.  I will purchase again. Great product!,5
B01MY10ZEG,These were exactly what I wanted.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Purchased for grandson with rather large feet. Fit perfectly and he loved them,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Thick, good quality,  not very soft and a smidge large.",4
B01MY10ZEG,great product and service,5
B01MY10ZEG,"All good, the only thing is that socks get lints easily after the first use.",5
B01MY10ZEG,Found these to be comfortable especially around the ankle and toes,5
B01MY10ZEG,I only gave four stars cause I don't like words and advertising on my clothing and there are words on the bottom.  I do not wear shoes in houses so yes people will see this sadly.  Still I like them.,4
B01MY10ZEG,they loved them,5
B01MY10ZEG,Met Description,5
B01MY10ZEG,One of the best quality socks I've purchased. Buying another 10 pack now.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Durable and well made. Took a long time to get here,5
B01MY10ZEG,I love them and would buy more!!,4
B01MY10ZEG,These are the most comfortable socks.I have ever owned.  They also double as slippers because of their cushiony feel.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Sock fits tight on my US size 9.5 foot.,3
B01MY10ZEG,"I wear shoe size 11.5 (USA men). The socks are sized for ""shoe size 6-12, sock size 10-13"". I found them to be under-sized and very snug.  See attached picture for a comparison with my previous socks (Dickies brand, purportedly the same size).The material is thick and pretty dense, resulting in a sock that feels very stiff, even after going through the wash a couple of times.",3
B01MY10ZEG,Comfortable to wear!,4
B01MY10ZEG,"Packed well, shipped fast, great socks. Very durable.",5
B01MY10ZEG,Husband is kinda picky about socks.  He really likes these.  He said that they keep his feet very warm so they are more suited for colder temperatures.,4
B01MY10ZEG,A little thicker and comfortable and definitely does pull the sweating away from your feet and keeps your feet dryer.,4
B01MY10ZEG,"It was a nice-looking sock and felt good, but it was a little tight for my 11.5 feet.",4
B01MY10ZEG,These socks are very comfortable and fit nicely.  They have also worn well and I can see that they will last a good amount of time.,5
B01MY10ZEG,These ankle high socks are so comfortable and fit my size 13 foot great.  10 pair for $20 ( 2$ pair in 10 pair bulk pack) Heavy cotton for foot comfort.  Highly recommend these socks if you want a heavy cotton sock for your tennis  shoes.I've been struggling with other manufactures socks being to small for my 13 foot for years,5
B01MY10ZEG,"These are great socks, very comfortable. I finish this review and then going to reorder another pack of them.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"I would have given these five stars but they are just a tad small for my size 11 feet. The squeeze is very minimal, I hardly notice it but after a full day of wearing them I start to feel a little squeeze. Anyone less than size 11 should be fine. The less your feet are squeezed by your socks the better off you will be for circulation purposes. Still very nice socks as far as thickness and softness goes. I highly recommend them. Remember, always wash before wearing clothing for the first time.",4
B01MY10ZEG,Thick and soft. actually cushion my feet.A little fuzzy the first time worn.,4
B01MY10ZEG,"(I was not paid for this review)Work construction on our feet all day. No struggle getting your foot into the sock, but plenty of support and they do not slide under my heel, the taller ones do not slide down either, thats so gross.  The pad of the sock does not wear out leaving a thick upper but nothing under your feet.  Not super thin, you may prefer thinner for summer, I prefer cushion as I walk all day and these keep my feet dry. They wash well but lose their elasticity after 9 months of constant washing.I have tried every brand out there, and the only sock I like better is Red Wing, but for the price, you can not go wrong here.  FYI I do not like rubber, I do not like nylon, I like cotton, spandex, and a little polyester for strength.Love these socks",5
B01MY10ZEG,This manufacture of socks is excellent. I previous used a different manufacturer and has since not been available. It is made with the same material and I found the quality to be excellent. They feel and seem to wear very well. They are comfortable. I will be using this manufacturer in the future as well. Great product and is highly recommended to buy.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Comfy and seem well made. Timely shipping,4
B01MY10ZEG,"My husband was pleasantly surprised with these socks.  The fit is great, and so comfortable, his favorite moisture wicking socks.",5
B01MY10ZEG,They are very comfortable and thick. Nice feet warmer on cold nights.,5
B01MY10ZEG,"These are comfy mostly cotton socks.  Nice and supportive.  Durable.  My feet get hot in non cotton socks, it does not happen with these.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"I almost never write reviews. Maybe I'm in a strange mood. Maybe the meds kicked in. Maybe this gives me 3 minutes of peace from our toddler who screamed at me cause her plate was the wrong color.  Regardless, these socks are awesome. They are the gold standard by which I now rate all other socks. Yesterday I was browsing socks at our local Walmart (as all men of success do) and realized I was feeling the heel of each sock available to determine if they had the softness, nay pillowyness and rapture of the socks posted here.  You see after 3 years of briefly wearing them outdoors without shoes, stepping around messes on the floor and failing (I mentioned the toddler, right?) that I realized I need new socks. And why would I settle? Don't I deserve nice things? Shouldn't my old man feet be coddled? The answer is yes my friends and faithful readers.  If you're thinking you too deserve a hug for your foot and to feel like a king, order these socksTldr: they're alright. Ordering more",5
B01MY10ZEG,Nice,5
B01MY10ZEG,Great price and Great  fit!!!!!!!,5
B01MY10ZEG,"These are great for cold weather, but for warmer weather go with a thinner sock.",4
B01MY10ZEG,"These socks are the most comfortable socks I've ever owned.  Even after numerous washes, they stay thick and look like new.  Highly recommend!!",5
B01MY10ZEG,"They last longer, and my husband loves them.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"I purchased these socks for my husband, and he absolutely loves them. He really likes the cushioning and the black soles. Would highly recommend these socks.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"I can't believe I'm writing a review for socks! A little background......I'm a bigger guy, about 250 lb, and I'm a big (literally) tennis player. I've never really found what I would consider ""really good"" socks. I have now. I've tried all of the high end name brand socks, and none of them held up very long without getting holes somewhere in them. I was on here looking to replenish some of my socks that were holy, and I was looking at the Thorlo tennis socks specifically. I like the thickest socks I can find, especially for tennis. Now I've bought Thorlos Level 3's in the past, and I just figured they were the best you can get, even though they didn't last very long at all themselves, especially for around 12 bucks a pair. Crazy expensive. So I'm reading the reviews for the Thorlos, and I saw a guy's review that recommended these socks instead. I clicked on the link he provided and read the info and the reviews, and I just thought to myself ""Yeah, another cheap product with a bunch of fake reviews"". But I figured that for 10 pairs for 16 bucks, what would it hurt to give them a shot. I'm SO glad I did! These things are not only as THICK as the Thorlos, they're much more DENSE, by that I mean a much higher thread count. These things feel so awesome, and are SO comfortable. And best of all, no holes! I wore them to work (I'm a service man) and at least 3 nights a week of 3 hour tennis matches. Still, no holes! It's kind of hard to believe you get 10 pairs for only 16 bucks.....amazing. I want to thank the guy who put them in his review of the Thorlos (Thanks guy!). I just ordered 2 more 10 packs, and I got rid of every other sock I have. I now have only these, so no searching for matches.I ordered more because every time I find something I love, they stop making it pretty soon. I'll just say this if you're looking at these socks and reading these reviews, and you're on the fence about buying them because they're so cheap.......BUY THEM NOW, you won't be disappointed!",5
B01MY10ZEG,Most comfortable socks I have worn in a long time.,5
B01MY10ZEG,These socks are made well with cushioned sole.  I like the availability of the larger size as the wearer is a men with a size 13 shoe.  Wash and wears well.,5
B01MY10ZEG,I bought this set years ago and loved these socks. Then I couldn't find them again and so I was forced to use different socks...they lasted about a year and then it was time for new ones. I was ELATED when I found these again and ordered them.The socks are thick and comfortable. They fit very well and support feet well too! The thing I love about these is they last for a LONG time. My last set lasted me 2-3 years worth of wear and this is now the standard socks have to live up to for me!,5
B01MY10ZEG,little on the thicker side,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Do not buy. I bought some a couple of years ago and they were great. I bought a second shipment a couple of months ago.  Five or six pair pilled on the first wear. Basically threw away 4-5 pair right off the bat.  They are defective. Too much loose cotton, not tightly woven.",2
B01MY10ZEG,I !ove socks and am pretty particular about them. My favorites have been Burlington ankle socks which were not available for quite awhile.  I tried this brand and they are good in numerous ways.  They stay put and don't  roll on your foot when walking.  They are comfortable  I like that the bottom has dark soles that don't show stains. .  I wear no shoes just socks in the house. They are a little thin but good for summer wear. These are ok socks. ButI just saw that they did bring back Burlington so I will be reordering those,3
B01MY10ZEG,These are some of the softest socks I have ever purchased. They are thick and so soft.,5
B01MY10ZEG,I put these on and they were super comfy.  Then I put my shoes on and went to work.  The socks were so thick that my second toes on both feet went numb.  I guess I can wear them around the house but not with shoes.,3
B01MY10ZEG,"I am in steel toed boots at work, these socks are thick at on the bottom and make a 12 hour day bearable.  I decided to check for summer socks and sure enough they make the same quality socks in socks to wear with my summer shoes and sneakers.  Oh, before I forget those work socks I have had for over 3 years, still like new. Seriously.",5
B01MY10ZEG,Thick and comfy. Don't wear out in a few months like the name brands.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Highly recommend these socks.  Husband was skeptical about ordering over internet.  They don't slip and slide on feet like some do.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Love the socks! Tight fitting on the foot and not the ankle. Thicker than most socks.,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Thick, soft and comfortable",5
B01MY10ZEG,"High quality, nice feeling socks that are comfortable to wear.The socks seem a tad tight for the size, but I would rather have them tight than loose.Overall a good quality, reasonably priced product.",4
B01MY10ZEG,"I bought these for my husband and he was very pleasantly surprised by how thick and cushiony these socks were. We were very pleased with the quality of these socks and we definitely buy more of these when needed. It's good to find a quality product we know we can return to so we don't have to go ""searching"" and ""testing"" in the future! It's rare to find a product we really like and when we do, we will stick with it! Thank you!",5
B01MY10ZEG,"They changed something with the toe seams.  The Enerwear socks I bought in the past had no seams that I could feel, these definitely have seams and they are very annoying seams.  Overall, the quality just doesn't seem to be there with the new ones.",3
B01MY10ZEG,"So, yea, socks. Not something most people get excited about, but I think these socks are worth it. 15-20 years ago I never thought about socks, just bought a pair of whatever brand and that was it. More recently it seemed my new socks weren't lasting very long. For a while sticking with some of the more well known name brands was enough to keep me in quality socks, but over the past few years every pair I had started getting holes in the heel rather quickly. Thus began my quest for anyone still making a good sock that would last. It was harder than I thought it would be because the name brands I used to have good experiences with all failed. If you compare a Gold Toe or a Hanes sock that you had from several years ago to one you buy today - you will likely notice the difference in quality. Todays socks seem to be thinner and using less material.  It seemed hopeless until I found The Enerwear.I bought these about 7 months ago and the quality difference and thickness of the sock is noticeable right away. They are comfortable with nice cushioning, fit perfectly and they look and fit as well today as the day I took them out of the package.Never thought I would be a sock snob, but after years of dealing with bad socks, I am excited to finally find someone making quality socks that will last more than a couple of months.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"Ordered Prime but they took a long time to arrive.  My husband tried them and liked the fit and comfort and I thought, goodbye name brand.  But with all this pilling, they may not last long.  Too bad.",3
B01MY10ZEG,Liked the first pack of 10 pairs so much that I bought this second pack.,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Soft, thick and warm.  My old ""go to"" sock isn't sold on Amazon any longer so I put some time into finding a good replacement.  These are better than the others.  I will purchase more.",5
B01MY10ZEG,Very thick and nice socks. They wash well and keep their shape.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Perfect thickness and comfortable,4
B01MY10ZEG,The are thick and comfortable.,5
B01MY10ZEG,I've been buying a name brand sock for years but recently they are getting hard to find. I bought these as they looked like they could be a good replacement.The socks are really comfortable. In fact more comfortable than what I've been wearing for years. The elastic seems stronger as well and these don't slip off my feet after walking around all day.These would be a 5 star sock except for 1 annoying issue. The lettering that goes across the bottom of the sock creates enough of a protrusion that it feels like there is something stuck in my shoe. I'm starting to get used to it after 2 weeks but it is a bit annoying.,4
B01MY10ZEG,"I a really surprised by the quality at this price point, very comfortable.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"These are great well made socks, thick and soft, my husband loves them, time will tell how well they hold up.",5
B01MY10ZEG,"Nice thick socks, keep feet warm!!!!",5
B01MY10ZEG,"I was worried that these would not be worth it, but was pleasantly surprised.",5
B01MY10ZEG,Fit just right.,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Sock look good and are comfortable, only problem was delivery. Where do you get these delivery people, I have a ""Ring"" installed at my door. Ran up sidewalk throw box took picture and left. The porch was wet and of course box landed in it. Could not take the extra step and place it on dry chair.",3
B01MY10ZEG,I wear these type of socks around the house and they are holding up well from the carpet. May be a little warm for summertime but at least they hold up. Don't breath the best but okay.,5
B01MY10ZEG,Love the fit. Very soft.,5
B01MY10ZEG,They are well made and very comfortable.  Just the right thickness but they pilled up pretty bad on the bottom so 4 out of 5 stars.,4
B01MY10ZEG,They were precisely as described,5
B01MY10ZEG,"A few years ago I decided to stop searching through a drawer of different styles of socks and start fresh with new, high quality socks that all matched. I found these and haven't looked back. They are thick enough to keep the backs of my shoes from rubbing my heel and give a little cushion. I remember when these were out of stock and am so happy to see them back. I just replaced my original purchase from 7 years ago with new socks. I'll keep returning to these as long as they keep making them.",5
B01MY10ZEG,Very happy with these socks for my son. He like them slightly thicker and these are good quality.,5
B01MY10ZEG,comfortable,5
B01MY10ZEG,"Very durable. Fit nicely. Good support & good stability, washes well & height as expected. Soft.",5
B01MY10ZEG,I'm going to stop buying socks online. Nothing is as it seems. These are thinner than I expected and the elastic around ankle is loose.,3
B01NAEIODL,Very soft and stretchy. High quality would buy again,5
B01NAEIODL,They fit well and are really simple to match after washing!  We have wore these a good bit and they are spot on!,5
B01NAEIODL,These are very comfortable.  They hold up longer than other socks with weekly washings and wearings.  They never get stretched out and never shrink.  Well worth the cost.,5
B01NAEIODL,I wear a 10 it fits almost to tight.,4
B01NAEIODL,I like how they feel and they stay up on my calf where I like. No dents or rings where socks put to much pressure.,5
B01NAEIODL,Comfy and fit great,5
B01NAEIODL,"These were decent socks for the money. I got 5 years out of them, the bottom of heal is the weak point and is wearing through on most of them now.As the price has doubled ($15 to $32) I will not be buying again.Even for a 6-pack, they are not $32 socks.",3
B01NAEIODL,"Liked the cotton, could have been a little higher and ran small for 10.5 foot size.",4
B01NAEIODL,"Most of my life I've bought socks that make my feet sweat. Not these. For the first time in my life, I have dry socks! And incredibly comfortable! I never thought it would be possible!",5
B01NAEIODL,"I like these socks and have been using them for many years. I recently ordered two packs fulfilled by Everyday Hero Co., and they sent me the version with the logo halfway up the sock instead of at the top. I didn't notice until it was too late to return them. Now I have a bunch of socks that I have to look at closely to ensure they match. Be sure to check that you get what you ordered right away.  :(",4
B01NAEIODL,"I didn't know socks mattered so much until I started running. As soon as Spring hit, my feet would get so hot with my cheap socks! I did some research and good, breathable socks get expensive fast. These seemed like a great deal and they really are so much better than regular every-day socks. Definitely recommend if you're looking for socks to workout in on a budget.",4
B01NAEIODL,The socks are fine but the second set of six I purchased from this company had the UA logo down near the ankles instead of near the top of the socks like the first set of six I purchased.,4
B01NAEIODL,New & sealed,5
B01NAEIODL,socks were great.,4
B01NAEIODL,Great fit,5
B01NAEIODL,I buy 12 pairs at a time. they seem to last long.,5
B01NAEIODL,"Up until two years ago, Amazon sold ""Dockers Men's Classics Dress Flat Knit Crew Socks"" with what I believed was the ""magic formula"":  83% Polyester, 15% Cotton, 2% Spandex.  They were extremely soft; relatively long wearing; and, for my ancient, injured body, very easy to get on my feet without help.  Sadly, they were discontinued some time ago.  Nevertheless, like an explorer seeking fabled treasure, I have pounced upon any socks professing to posses the ""magic formula"" with the hope (and prayer) that they would be ""soft, long wearing, and easy to put on"".Alas and alack, although Under Armor makes numerous SUPREMELY EXCELLENT products, these socks, despite claiming to have the  desired blend of polyester, cotton, and spandex, are NOT SOFT, and NOT EASY TO PUT ON.  Furthermore, they GET MORE SCRATCHY AFTER WASHING.  My quest will continue.",3
B01NAEIODL,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These are size L and he uses 10.5Good quality without a doubt, my husband has been trying them out for several days and they are very comfortable, soft, and don't fall off. One recommendation is to wash them before using them because they release several black lint, but after several washes, they improve.",5
B01NAEIODL,Husband is very happy on his feet all day,5
B01NAEIODL,Good price.  Quick delivery.,5
B01NAEIODL,These things leave your toes full of black fuzz. So if you do not clean your feet after removing them your bare feet will leave black fuzzy deposits wherever you walk or even in your bed.,3
B01NAEIODL,"I'm reviewing an old purchase because I've had these socks and enjoyed them for a while until the interior of the sock became so ""pilly"" with little bits of black fabric rolling up loose that I started washing them inside out. Still little tufts of sock ended up littered about wherever I took the socks off. Had to trash them finally. The white ones too. (same review for those but in white)",3
B01NAEIODL,"I almost NEVER buy a name brand anymore.  But, after many tries with other brands - I can say - Under Armor does it right like nobody else does.  I do not know why, but they are not too tight.  They are not too hot.  They just feel and wear perfect.  Worth the extra few dollars.",5
B01NAEIODL,Helps with my tired feet,5
B01NAEIODL,"Bought these Under Armor socks for my son, he is playing  AAU basketball.  He loves the way they feel and how they fit!",5
B01NAEIODL,I have never had a problem with Under Armour socks in the past. I actually still have some old pairs that I have worn for quite some time. I have not actually wore these socks listed yet but I have no doubt that they will outlast the Adidas socks I had purchased a few months ago.They feel quality and durable. The material make-up does not matter to me as I just immediately ripped open the packaging without paying any attention to it. They are packed really well - almost too well.My only issue so far with these socks is that I received 3 striped pairs and two pairs with the plain logo - the last pair was mismatched with one of each (I double-checked too). I don't plan to return as I am rough on socks and this does at least give me the convenience of replacing one sock when I get a hole and prevent me from throwing away an entire pair when one gets a hole.,4
B01NAEIODL,Comfortable and they work out for an active lifestyle. Highly recommend it!,5
B01NAEIODL,Comodidad,5
B01NAEIODL,"These are my husbands favorite socks. Keep there shape, long lasting before holes appear. Reinforced areas for comfort.",5
B01NAEIODL,"These have been my go-to socks for work for 6 years, but the most recent pack (Jan, 2024) feel like an acrylic blend rather than the previous cotton.  Comfort took a hit with the change, only time will tell if they will last as long as their predecessors.",3
B01NAEIODL,I got them for my boyfriend as a gift and he loved them!,5
B01NAEIODL,These socks breath very well and don't squeeze your ankles.  I wear them everyday.,5
B01NAEIODL,"My favorite socks, ever. The only socks for me!",5
B01NAEIODL,"The socks are excellent for running.They are cleverly designed to have much less cotton on the top center area of the foot, which makes running shoes fit much betterThe socks are a ""snug"" fit in that they do not cramp my toes or anything, but they give a snug overall fit to my foot that is noticeable.I would not wear them around the house, or with walking shoes for comfort because they would feel too snug.For running I really like how much better they are when compared to my old traditional style socks.",4
B01NAEIODL,"I washed the socks WELL four times and the smell became less, but still had that kerosene smell.Sadly, because of a skin sensitivity, I discarded the socks.As far as quality, they are made well and looked like they would last.",3
B01NAEIODL,durable and fits comfortable with ur shoes.,5
B01NAEIODL,"I fully expected these to be the cheap-o socks by big brand Under Armor, competing with Starter and stepping down from their $10/pair athletic socks. I was definitely wrong. I don't run 20 miles a day in them or anything, but I work in a manufacturing plant and they make my steel toe boots a lot more comfortable. I saw a lot of complaints and bad reviews about poor quality, but in the business, I call those escapes (defects that got to the public), and I doubt any of these negative Nancys even thought about contacting the company. That said, I will update if these fall apart in the next month or maybe I'll just get my money back on the return policy._:UPDATE:_Still going strong - no sock has failed me yet and they're not stretched out at all after washing several dozen times, so definitely would buy again, but don't even need to now or anytime soon!",5
B01NAEIODL,My son says these are the most comfortable socks he's ever worn. Wash and dry well; very comfortable.,5
B01NAEIODL,The package arrived quickly and in great shape.  These socks were exactly as described.,5
B01NAEIODL,"Still the most comfortable fit for any crew sock I've tried, but the ""2.0"" Charged Cotton socks seem to be a step down from the original.I found these felt a little too tight when new, and after 8-12 wash cycles, they are all showing excessive pilling on the outside/bottom of the sock-- neither of these things were true of my original UA Charged Cotton socks, even though they've gone through more wash cycles. They're also very slightly shorter.I suspect this batch of v2.0 won't last as long as the originals, since the footbeds are already fraying. If you're trying UA socks for the first time, try the originals which were still sold on Amazon, last I checked.",4
B01NAEIODL,I love these socks. So comfortable and warm!! Great value for the money!!,5
B01NAEIODL,"I got them for my mom as a gift. She complained about the lint it leaves behind (the other reviews are accurate) so she claims she ""hated them and they're disgusting"" but I think she's just an angry little Asian.So now I have them. And I LOVE THEM. Yes. They leave lint and it's kinda different (I never had linty feet like this before ) but I'm not going to complain. They work perfectly in my leather boots. They're so comfortable and my boss is happy I got rid of my hello kitty socks.Botton line. Yes there's lint. But who cares ? They're socks! Comfy comfy socks.  I have a vaccum. I have no complaints. I will order again very soon:)",5
B01NAEIODL,"The socks are great and I would have made them a five, the problem was in getting them, not the socks. I ordered two sets and I only got one, there were issues in timing and reorder.  I would like to be able to order again in the future but the issues may cause hesitation. My son needs only plain white socks because of problems with his feet. These socks seem to be working.  I hate that added stress was involved.",3
B01NAEIODL,"The front seams are above the toes, and they can't be felt, the arch band keeps them in place, and the heel section fits perfectly. They are very comfortable socks, but be very careful when opening the pack, because the anti-theft plastic piece that runs through each sock, can easily cause a hole in them as well. They are so tightly binded together that you can barely fit scissors in between to cut the plastic tabs, to seperate them. Just trying to release them, the socks are easily damaged. Once that hole is made, it only gets bigger, so open them carefully.",4
B01NAEIODL,"I wear a size 10.5 US shoe, and wide shoes usually fit me best. That said, these socks appear well made, but fit slightly too snuggly around my foot and leg. I think the combination of being slightly too small and a good amount of elasticisty, make them feel too tight when I first put them on.",5
B01NAEIODL,Good quality sock. They were a gift and were truly liked. Would buy again.,5
B01NAEIODL,"I have pairs of these socks and they have held up pretty well so I ordered some more.  The ""Size Chart"" for me doesn't deal with sock sizes, so  I selected ""Medium"" from the size choices figuring it would be around a 9 - 12 like I get in stores.  Nope.  When the socks arrived I got Men's 4 - 8 size.  I have returned them and reordered ""Large.""  Let's see what that brings.  I'm a medium for everything else in men's wear so why Amazon thought Medium was 4 - 8 for men baffles me.",5
B01NAEIODL,"I've tried a number of different socks and had a problem with fit on all of them. They advertise fitting sizes 6 - 12. I wear a 10 1/2 shoe size. All of them felt okay at first but were all tight enough that my ankles felt itchy (from lack of circulation) when I took them off. These socks are not nearly as tight and feel good through the day and I don't have the issues with itchiness after taking them off in the evening. They are tight enough to stay in place, not sagging, during the day.",5
B01NAEIODL,"I have bought many differnet pairs and brands of socks. NIKE DON'T EVEN MAKE A YEAR before they are shedding and falling apart and getting those annoying patches on the heel and ball of your foot These things have easily 3x the durability of nike socks. I would say more, but I haven't had any pair for more than 3 years, LITERALLY not one has started to hole on me though. I love these socks. They fuzz for a couple weeks in the beginning but that stops. Nike literally fuzz from day 1 to death. I was so happy to just throw them all out and get tons of these.",5
B01NAEIODL,Perfect fit and texture,5
B01NAEIODL,"I really like these socks, they are very cushioned, the support is geat. Being black they go with a variety of outfits and shoes very easily. My one gripe is the packing. The plastic tie is so short and close to the sock that I actually cut one of them before I even got to wear them. Spend the extra quarter a unit and get a longer plastic tie. Even with that however I will purchase again",4
B01NAEIODL,nice fit,5
B01NAEIODL,"Upon opening the package, all the socks had a distinct chemical smell. I thought that after washing them, the smell would go away. It didn't, it just wasn't as strong and slowly fading. The smell is most likely a dye associated with the fabric.",3
B01NAEIODL,Everything is perfect about them socks. Except the price they are too costly,5
B01NAEIODL,"I've bought a ton of these socks over the years.  Basically once a year, I purchase a 6 pack so I have one set for every workday of the week.  I replace the socks annually, not so much because they are worn out but rather because a sock or two invariable goes missing.  Once I don't have enough to make a full work week, I just replace them all at once so they are evenly worn, rather than having one that's a year old and another that's brand new, etc.  They're cheap enough to do this, and I just donate the good but older ones to the Salvation Army.",5
B01NAEIODL,Just what I was looking for. UA quality at a good price and quick delivery.,5
B01NAEIODL,My husband loves them,5
B01NAEIODL,"I'm a big dude so not only do I need the right length but I need socks that don't squeeze the ever loving toe jam out of my feet. These socks are soft which is why I went with them. Unfortunately for us bigger guys, the elasticity in them is a bit much and it leaves a nice indent in my shin/calf after I take them off. That's just a me being fat thing, not necessarily a design flaw. Alas, I had to ditch them but the good news is my wife loves wearing them now.",4
B01NAEIODL,"These are great socks, very comfortable to the feet.  However, be aware that the crew part is tight!  I wear a women's shoe size 7.5, so ordered the Women's 6-9 size.  They fit my feet perfectly, but they are tight on my ankles and calves, which I would describe as slim.  If you have large or thick ankles or calves, you may need to find a way to stretch them.  Otherwise, I highly recommend them.",4
B01NAEIODL,"I've been buying them for years and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The primary reason is because this is probably one of the better deals you can find, they don't last forever but you definitely get your money's worth. I put a lot of wear and tear on my clothing so I don't expect them to hold up forever but they do a good job I would definitely recommend.",5
B01NAEIODL,"They seem to be a decent,  light weight sock.  I have only worn them a couple times and only washed them a couple times.  So far they are holding up but I am seeing a little fraying in one of the pairs but not sure if that was my fault or the product.  Will know more soon after more use and more washings",4
B01NAEIODL,"I run. I lift. I walk. I drink beer around bonfires. I know socks are socks for the most part --- most of us just go to a department store and buy whatever is cheapest. I started running more seriously and found that most socks get torn and wear out super fast when you're running more and more. Used to wear Adidas but they always get holes at the ball of the foot. I figured why not try out these? Can't hurt to switch brands until something sticks.Absolutely nothing special about these socks. They are thin, cheap feeling, ready to pill, and the underarmor logo isn't even good looking. There is zero support for high-wear areas of these socks either --- they are even thinner than the Adidas socks I have worn in the past. There is absolutely nothing athletic about them. I'd say buy these if you're looking for just everyday black socks... but why spend twice as much for the underarmor logo?I will say in the past I was gifted underarmor ankle socks and those were 10x the quality that these crew socks. No idea why underarmor did not just take that design and give it a crew length. Haven't seen that pattern since, and my guess is that UA decided to outsource to a cheaper producer and it shows dearly.",2
B01NAEIODL,"I have purchased 2 six packs of these sock over the last few years and they are very comfortable however, I have come to realize that they develop holes near the heel far too quickly.  I have a pair of similar socks I bought from Eddie Bauer about 10 years ago that are still good.  Ill be looking for different socks.",2
B01NAEIODL,First time trying this brand of socks----have not used long enough to have idea of durability---but as far as fit goes these are doing very well for me---I have a size 14 shoe and socks to fit that size are few and far between---well please with how well they stay up on my leg as my leg is larger than most----good socks and will purchase again!!!,4
B01NAEIODL,"I have used these socks for a long time. They do stain pretty easily, and do stretch out over time. But they are more than good enough for the price! I would say they are thin, which is good for hot weather. Otherwise they are my worl out socks and I will likely buy them again when these wear out in a year or two.",4
B01NAEIODL,Comfortable thick socks,5
B01NAEIODL,"Comfortable socks, but these are not lasting at all.  Black lint from the socks comes off all over the house and after a few months half of them have holes in the bottom and have had to be thrown away.  The others are not long for this world either.  The good, they have enough cotton in them that I can walk on the tile floor without slipping.  I hate polyester socks for this reason I look for mostly cotton.  The bad, they are falling apart really fast.  I expect to get at least 1 year out of socks, the first sock was holey in less than 2 months and practically every week now another one bites the dust.  I don't expect to pay this much for socks that only last 3 months.",3
B01NAEIODL,Honestly the most comfortable and best looking socks I've ever used. The only issue I have is every time you take them off especially the new pairs they leave a ton of lint and cotton all over your feet.,4
B01NAEIODL,So despite the approximate years shelf life on these socks I still continue to buy them. They fit well and I know what to expect with them.,4
B01NAEIODL,"Great socks, love em. Just wish they didn't shed so darn much. When I take them off, my feet are covered in fibers, enough to tell whether I was wearing red ones, black ones or gray ones. And one developed a small hole at the toe seam after only one or two uses. Still, they're overall good quality but shed like a dog until they've been washed at least 3 times.",4
B01NAEIODL,Nice socks but the color fades sooner than I expected.,4
B01NAEIODL,Own the white and bought the black for winter golf.,4
B01NAEIODL,I love how comfortable these are.But I don't really like the burning rash they give me. I think it's some kind of allergy. No matter how many times I wash them or what kind of detergent I use it always gives me a burning rash on the top of my feet. I've bought multiple sets of these socks over the years and every single one always gives me a painful rash after a few hours.,3
B01NAEIODL,This was a great product I got them for my daughter because she needs long socks with her ankle braces for basketball and they work very well and are very comfortable.,5
B01NAEIODL,"I purchased these for my husband and he seems to like them.  He has large feet, and says that the XL fit him well, although the calves may need to stretch out with a few wearings.  We have yet to find out how they hold up through repeated washings, but have not had any issues with quality so far.  I ordered two more packages of these since the quality seems to be good and he likes them.",4
B01NAEIODL,These are great socks for exercise or work,5
B01NAEIODL,I will Continue to buy the socks for as long as I live or as long as they make them I work on my feet all the time most comfortable sock ever worn,5
B01NAEIODL,Love them . Fits an wears great,5
B01NAEIODL,There nice. Real name brand. But got giant hole in sock after minimal wear for one year,4
B01NAEIODL,"I picked these socks because they have a lot of cotton and no nylon. The description says, ""76% Cotton, 22% Polyester, 2% Spandex."" But the socks I got had an un-removeable sticker covering up the part of the package that listed the fabric content, and they were very shiny, which I think must mean they are synthetic and not cotton. They were also really uncomfortable. I'm going to see if I can return them.",2
B01NAEIODL,These socks fit well and do not lose their shape. They fit snug but not tight. They have great arch support. The pack is also a great price for the brand. Excellent product. This was a repurchase. I purchased one pack earlier and my husband like them I purchased a second pack. YES - BUY THEM,5
B01NAEIODL,"If you're a woman buying these socks, here's my take on them:  I had originally purchased them in a size M, and I tried them on immediately after receiving them.  Although they felt okay, I knew they'd probably be tight after laundering them.  So I exchanged them for a size L, and they are perfect, even after laundering.  And I was right, they did shrink up a bit.  I wear a size 10.5 shoe, medium width.  I really like these socks - the 'band' supporting the arch area feels great.  I probably will buy another pack of these socks, just in case they are discontinued.",5
B01NAEIODL,"These socks are ridiculously comfortable, but wash before using them. Otherwise your feet will be covered in loose material. In fact, that will probably happen anyway for the first few uses. At that time, you might notice a few holes developing in the socks- but not all of them. Out of the 6 pair, I've had about 3 socks (1.5 pair) form small holes that I really only notice when putting them on. They're also kind of warm. The price is good, but you'll be replacing them before you know it.There isn't really anything special about these- they do not give much support, so no squeeze on the arch or calf, just a basic, generic sock that does it's job comfortably.",3
B01NAEIODL,Does as it should,5
B09C4WJ38S,"Bought a size Large for my boy friend, Not thick which is wonderful, fits perfect TTS, very warm on very cold days, great value, great quality!Very soft! Will buy again",5
B09C4WJ38S,Fit is just perfect for me. Nice and thick compared to mid weight. Very comfortable and appear to be made well. The cost is high but I think it's a good product. I wear these under my paper thin uniform pants and I stay comfortable. I'm outside about 50% of my time for my job and I live in Wisconsin.,5
B09C4WJ38S,I purchased the 320. These things will definitely keep you warm. Very soft and comfortable. Fits very well. The quality seems to be great. The seams are well stitched and do rub on anything causing irritation. It's almost like wearing air. It also comes with socks that are better than my other wool socks Definitely going to buy the lighter weight as the 320 is too much for anything over 30 degrees. They will definitely keep you warm all day.,5
B09C4WJ38S,I am pleasantly surprised at the quality this long underwear. Both the top and the bottoms are very comfortable. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for warmth and comfort.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"XLG 320 heavyweight blk. Set 6'1"" 190 lbs. Winter in the Pacific Northwest has been bitter cold this year, and I wear an assortment of long johns made from various materials, but none made from 100% wool. The fit is loose (not a bunch up under your outer clothing), and the quality of the material and craftsmanship is better than most. The wool material is soft and not itchy; I have no complaints. The 320 heavyweights are thick and have noticeable weight; again, I have no complaints. The versatility of this set is unmatched, allowing me to adapt to any winter activity.I have worn the set for multiple days and nights with temps in the negative degrees, working on equipment, loading firewood, shoveling snow, and operating ATV for extended lengths of time, and have stayed warm through coffee breaks and meals. Typically, when wearing my other sets, I will have to change tops if I take an extended break outside in a nonheated building because I'm soaking wet, and the cold starts setting in. I didn't have a problem with this set.I recommend these over my silk sets since they are better at wicking away moisture and keeping me warm when damp. Hand washing is a pain, so I'll see how things work on the ""hand wash"" setting on the washing machine. By the way, black shows every dog's hair, lint fuzz, etc., that you can imagine. I give it a 4-star rating for now. I will update you on the durability and longer-term wear in a few months.",4
B09C4WJ38S,"I have had the wool base layer set for a week and I love it.  It keeps me warm when it is cold and I do not overheat like with synthetics.  The Heavyweight base layer isn't too thick, but it keeps me warm without any moisture issues.  I say the purchase was well worth the price.  Good job Merino.tech!",5
B09C4WJ38S,"I haven't bought long underwear in like 10 to 15 years.  I feel like I can live in these daily ... Fantastic quality, So soft and comfortable",5
B09C4WJ38S,"I am 5'4"" 160 pounds and the medium fit well. It wasn't tight but wasn't too loose either. Wore it as a base layer on backpacking trip where the temp got down to 22 degrees. I believe the 320g long underwear was a big part of keeping my core warm. Fabric is comfy and not itchy.",5
B09C4WJ38S,Quality looks good..Size was spot on.  Im 511 180 fit body style and the Medium was tight but just the way I like it.,5
B09C4WJ38S,I wore these to ski in -5 to 5F conditions and they kept me warm all day.,5
B09C4WJ38S,If you know take care of a good wool product and still have an issue they will help you.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"My office didn't have the heat working.  I purchased this product to wear under my suit and it fits great, it's comfortable and kept me warm during the recent cold spell.",4
B09C4WJ38S,"Just received this, large 250gsm. Weighs 240 grams. My also large minus33 230gsm pair weighs 280 grams, and that's after wearing them for a season.They feel virtually indistinguishable from each other however.The stitching is very similar, but the minus33 has a slightly wider elastic strip and trim around the pocket.For the price difference, I feel these are almost too close to call a winner on quality, and would go with Merino.Tech when on sale.I've also purchased a number of shirts and boxers from both brands and will compare when I can.",4
B09C4WJ38S,"I work outside in northeast NJ. This set worked so well, that I ordered a second set.",5
B09C4WJ38S,"This se, top and bottom,  we're bought as a gift for someone who works outdoors in the winter.  The fabric is soft and not itchy There is sufficient stretch in the fabric to allow free movement.  Until the person wears it  we won't know if it keeps ome warm enough",4
B09C4WJ38S,Working in the field at 8 degrees i don't feel my body losing any heat. I'm staying very warm and i worn them comfortably around the house as well.,5
B09C4WJ38S,I love Moreno wool for it's wicking. It's a great base layer with just the right thickness so as not to be bulky under clothes.,5
B09C4WJ38S,Great gift for my brother who lives in Alaska! He says they are his favorite pair with socks also keeping him warm,5
B09C4WJ38S,I purchased these for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves them. He says they are very warm very well-made so far.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"I'm a male 6 ft 185 to 190 lb . I ordered 3x in 320 weight I'm excited and super satisfied with my purchase. Thanks! Even though the arms of the shirt are a little long, they have a nice taper so they don't fall past my wrist. My waist a 34/36 and they stay on my waist. I was surprised I was prepared that I'd have to have my daughter take in the waste but it's not necessary. Nice elastic waist. Super cool socks. Very nice. I also don't like wearing skin tight undergarments. So yeah, they're a little baggy in some spots but that don't bother me and I figure being at 100% wool no matter how they're cared for. They're going to shrink to some extent over time",5
B09C4WJ38S,Kept me nice and warm during hunting season!,5
B09C4WJ38S,Really cold weather while commuting to work.,5
B09C4WJ38S,This thing keeps you warm.,5
B09C4WJ38S,Ordered these for my beau for Christmas and he loves them. Very good quality. True to size. He can't wait to wear them on a camping trip.,5
B09C4WJ38S,My husband was very happy to receive this & loves it.,4
B09C4WJ38S,"I was very happy that when I pulled this item out of it's packaging that when I put it on. it was very comfortable and not itchy and that it fit perfectly. I normally do not like to buy clothing online because more times than not, I'm having to return something because we don't seem to agree on dimensions. But I'm happy in this case, that it fit very well. I'm looking forward to using it during my winter camping trip.",5
B09C4WJ38S,I like,5
B09C4WJ38S,"We have a trip scheduled to Iceland coming up and needed some base layers as the trip is late November/Early December. We found the Merino Tech here at Amazon and the wife ordered one set to see how it fit. She was pleasantly surprised to find that the fit was perfect for her size with long enough sleeves and waist/leg length perfect as well. I'm 6' tall, with a 34"" inseam, so I thought, what the heck, I'll try the men's size. Lo and behold, it is just as perfect a fit for me as it was for her. The inseam is plenty long enough to be below sock height and the sleeve length is just beyond my wrist joint, so under gloves will be perfect. I'll follow up with performance reviews after the trip but for now am quite pleased with the fit for starters. She bought a womans 2 xl and I bought a man's 2 xl for reference.Follow-Up: The trip to Iceland was a success and the Merino wool we purchased was a fantastic decision. We were there on land for two full weeks and the Wool was worn every day and we were grateful we did. Temps ranged from the low 30's to upper Teens, with winds up to 40+ mph and the wool never felt cold with only a jeans layer over them on bottom. Coat, shirt  over the top worked well even at night watching for the Lights. These are a great item and I would recommend highly to anyone needing a solid base layer.",5
B09C4WJ38S,These keep me very warm. The material is thin so you don't have to worry much about bunching. These fit great underneath your clothes for a base layer.,5
B09C4WJ38S,Look and feel good. Sizing is appropriate.  Great deal for wool baselayer,5
B09C4WJ38S,"I bought this for our trip to Antarctica.  It is so soft and comfortable!  I'm sure it will be the perfect base layer.  Shipping was quick, too.",5
B09C4WJ38S,"I am currently using them. It's super warm. I am up in Washington state working as an airplane mechanic in cold hangars, and winter backpacking trips. These are super nice and warm. They are super thin and lightweight, but very warm. I just walked around in heavy wind, and just had these and a normal shirt and pants on, and I was warm. Totally recommend this. The socks are great. I will update on how durable they are once I wear them more.",4
B09C4WJ38S,"My husband is a mail carrier in the Midwest and it gets very cold in winter. He was very impressed with how these kept him warm while delivering mail. They're not itchy, very soft and comfortable. He is looking to get a few more sets. Highly recommend!",5
B09C4WJ38S,"If your someone who's cold easily or often, like me, this stuff actually works. Going to work at 5am I'm always freezing, but now I'm totally comfortable, I can walk around the house without the heat on.  This is definitely the warmest thermals I've ever had, which I expected for 100 dollars, but they delivered.  Very happy.",5
B09C4WJ38S,Good product,5
B09C4WJ38S,Great product very warm and quality,5
B09C4WJ38S,Soft nice wool. Better than smart wool in my opinion especially for the price,5
B09C4WJ38S,Quality wool. Non itchy warm. Very comfortable underlayer. will purchase more.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"Wish I bought these sooner, these are very soft and comfortable and very well made. The size is perfect. These are very warm but not sweaty at all. Wish they came in a different color.",5
B09C4WJ38S,I like the fit but dislike it being itchy. Hope the itch goes away. I will order undershirts just in case.,4
B09C4WJ38S,Came in timely fashion. However did not receive long John's. Only top and socks.Update:Within 1 days time a new set arrived at my home after writing bad review. A review that wasn't deserved by the way because the next morning I found the bottoms and it was completely my mistake. So I will be sending back the set they sent my so quickly to remedy this false error. Gotta keep it honest. My mistake. Not theirs. By the way wore them to work today 32 degrees in the am. They worked like a charm.,5
B09C4WJ38S,Excelente producto sobre todo para la temporada de Frio y Nieve.,5
B09C4WJ38S,True to size - fit perfectly. Not too tight. Very warm (he just tested them in 12-degree Minnesota weather). Just ordered another set.,5
B09C4WJ38S,Very soft and comfortable.  If a sale comes I will buy more,5
B09C4WJ38S,I work at a distribution center and the shirt and pants set are great for warmth in the wi ter since it's a bit cold on night shift. I believe you get what you pay for and price should be no substitute for comfort. I like them so much I bought 9 sets so I'll always have one at the ready,5
B09C4WJ38S,great wear,5
B09C4WJ38S,So soft and warm,5
B09C4WJ38S,"This will be the second pair of thermals I have bought from them. Great fit, comfortable, and warm. I do wish Merino tech had more plus sizes like 3x and 4x in US sizes because a lot of my friends say they never have their size along with a better shipping method or dept, because waiting a month or more for a shipment is crazy. Ordered this time in Nov. for a Dec. delivery now delivery is pushed back until after Dec. 27th...",3
B09C4WJ38S,I like it. I feel warm,5
B09C4WJ38S,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm learning that whenever you buy wool, even if it is Merino wool, you gotta soften it up on your own. American corporate won't do it for you, otherwise they would charge you a lot more money. I was lazy doing the research. So I didn't wear it my first winter when I bought this last year. I'm currently using it now that I've learned and done the research to soften wool. I used Eucalan & wool wash to soften this piece. It took a few tries. I ended up just using warm water - after dipping it in vinegar. I now skip the vinegar step and go straight to the Eucalan or wool wash (I actually combine the two, at times) with warm water. Now, after a full year or so, I can gladly say it's a super soft piece. It took some work and research, but I got it done. That being said, I think wool costing $100 is a little much in my opinion, but I don't dictate the market.Update 7/02/2024: So I finally got off my butt and took pictures and video to complete this review. At this point, I've owned it for about a year and a half. I made the content over the summer while it's in storage. Also, update, when you soften wool, it works best with cold water, not warm like I originally thought.",5
B09C4WJ38S,"Bought a set for my husband after he was jealous of the set I had bought myself. He used to think there was no reason to spend bigger money on thermals. He's wearing the set's top as I write this. The material feels incredible. Silky smooth to the touch, but keeps you warm. It works perfectly as the inner most layer on chilly, outdoor days, or just as a comfy set at home!",5
B09C4WJ38S,"Good weight, sized correctly and not scratchy. Should be great for Northern Lights viewing!",5
B09C4WJ38S,Keeping me warm,5
B09C4WJ38S,Light soft and warm and wicks away moisture,5
B09C4WJ38S,very good worth the price good quality,5
B09C4WJ38S,"I have been using the synthetic stuff for years for my stand hunting. It always made me sweat on my way to the hunting stand and then you got cold. I tried all kinds of things from walking to my stand in just my insulated underwear and packing my over stuff. that helped but what a pain in the a$$. I bought this set and instantly was happy. Even if I broke a sweat the wool soaked it up and then dried itself with no loss of warmth. It doesn't stink even if I have to go a couple of days between washing it out. I will never go back it's WOOL from now on. SOFT, WARM easy to care for and the fit was right on. You want it to fit snug but not restrict movement, this does that. A tighter fit allows this to remove all the dampness that your body puts off, you will never feel clammy or have those sweat droplets running down your back again. If you can't tell by now I love this stuff, I'm 6ft 245 lbs in shape but carting a few extra pounds. Spend a lot of time outdoors and wear this when the temps hit the 40's and lower. I actually have two sets that I wear when the temps drop even more and can sit on a stand all day in the 20's and never get cold. BUY THESE you will find you like the cold again.",5
B09C4WJ38S,My husband needed new wool layers for a trip to Antarctica and this was a great price for this set that included socks. The material is stretchy and soft. It includes special washing instructions to keep it supreme shape. Very pleased with our purchase.,5
B09C4WJ38S,The shirt fits well and it is very warm. I am very satisfied with the purchase.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"Very soft, very warm, great value",5
B09C4WJ38S,I will never go back to under armor again under armor is a joke compared to these long johns! Under armor's best pair can't touch these,5
B09C4WJ38S,"Pretty good fit for me, and do a fair job of wicking moisture.  But seem to be getting holes/ falling apart for not that much use",4
B09C4WJ38S,"I work as an Environmental Restoration Technician and this has been a gamechanger when you're outside, in the cold and wearing this under regular cotton clothing and so forth. You may look like you're not wearing much compared to everyone else but you'll be heaps warmer, and those around you will begin to question why you're not wearing a jacket and/or coat.Beyond that, the flexibility allows for maximum movement if you dont want to be wearing a thick jacket. The heat retention and wind blocking is also great in windy environments. Also it's merino, so it helps wick sweat and water away.This definitely made my winter field season much easier and manageable if I didn't have this. Definitely worth it!!!",5
B09C4WJ38S,"It's been a few months since I started looking for some cold gear. By chance, I stumbled upon this set and decided to give it a try. I'm 5'11"" with an athletic build and a 30 waist size, weighing 165 pounds, so I ordered a small set.Let me start by saying that these 320 clothes are incredibly warm. I've worn them twice, and both times it was below freezing temperature. I was wearing a pullover under a vest, and it felt pretty comfortable. I also love the blue color of the set.However, I must say that the small shirt is very tight, to the point of being uncomfortable. If it shrinks even a little bit, I won't be able to put it on. On the other hand, the pants are a perfect fit for me. If I were to order a medium set, the shirt would fit, but the pants would be too loose.As for the socks, the vendor seems to assume that people who order a small set have the feet of an eight-year-old child. Unfortunately, that's not the case for me since the socks are size 8.5, and my feet are size 10.5. The socks are so small that I didn't even bother opening the package since they wouldn't fit me anyway.To wrap this up, the items in the set work well for keeping me warm in the cold weather. However, the fit isn't exactly what I was hoping for, and the socks are more suitable for a child than for an adult.",3
B09C4WJ38S,Excellent combo set bought as a gift.,5
B09C4WJ38S,Perfect for staying warm in hunting woods on cold days.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"My husband needed to be out working in cold weather (teens and 20s) on a project he has to get done- can't wait for warmer weather. He tasked me to buy some thermal underwear for him, but I found this product (I got the mid-weight set) that seemed much nicer and warmer instead. I took a risk on these even though they are pricey compared to many other long underwear brands, but this is truly a situation where you get what you pay for. He says this set is awesome. It is totally keeping him comfortable and warm in the teens-30 degree weather. He can strip off outer layers as needed. Also the fit was surprisingly great. My husband has long arms (shirts are always too short) but this fit perfectly. Typically the legs would be short too on him, but again, this product fit perfectly in length. (He's 6'2"").  I am bad at writing reviews unless I love a product, and I'm taking the time to do this one because I'm so happy that I don't have to worry about him freezing (he had previously been warming up in his truck every once in a while before going back to work), that I took the time to write this. Definitely definitely recommend. I anticipate buying another set for him.",5
B09C4WJ38S,Nice and soft very warm,5
B09C4WJ38S,"Super warm and comfortable.  Fit really well. 5'11"" 200lbs. Ordered Large. Love em",5
B09C4WJ38S,Bought for my polar expedition.  Top true to size. Bottom is on the larger size.  Usually wear XL. Large would be perfect.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"I am going to the arctic this winter. I was told to get a wool base layer. I thought this would be itchy. It wasn't at all. I wore it a few hours and all was good except it got very warm. So, I expect it to keep me warm this winter. Note that I have short arms, but it fit well. It wasn't like most tops where I have an extra six inches of sleeves. I also was surprised it came with wool socks. They are good also.",5
B09C4WJ38S,Will work for me this winter while in the deer stand.,5
B09C4WJ38S,"Found these on Amazon and was due for a replacement set. I mainly use these as a base while riding my motorcycle. Sizing is spot on for the top. The bottoms may be a tad big but, that will keep the boys from being restricted. The weight of these are about the same as a pair of this sweat pants. The 250 are plenty thick to keep the chill off and maintain body heat. They perform great and at 45 degrees, I didn't have to bundle up for my hour long commute to work. Definitely will be buying another set after this review. I recommend washing them before wearing. Natural fibers such as wool tend to smell funky when not allowed to breathe. Do not dry these in a dryer on a cycle with any heat. I unfortunately learned that the hard way on my wool socks years ago. One recommendation to the manufacturer would be to put thumb holes or loops in the bottom of the sleeves.",5
B09C4WJ38S,Kept us warm in 38 degree weather!,5
B09C4WJ38S,Comfortable and warm.  Excited for deer hunting in these,5
B09C4WJ38S,"I found this the be a superb product. While outside in sub 0 degrees Celsius weather I found myself comfortable wearing these underneath my normal clothes. Before I was wearing 3-4 additional layers and not staying warm at all, but these definitely did the trick.The material and quality of the sewing seems high. They are not itchy or scratchy on the bare skin which is a big positive for me. It also doesn't feel like it's squeezing me to death. The best compliment I can honestly give is that I don't feel like I have them on, but can tell that I am noticably warmer with them on.I will definitely be wearing these regularly and hope to have plenty of use for them.",5
B09C4WJ38S,"I found this brand about a year ago whrn search for a guft for my husband. He loved it and it came with really nice socks. Since then, all of his wish list items have come from merino.tech merchandise. Just this Christmas he got a huge haul of items. His shirts from last year do have some holes now from his belt rubbing at the bottom, but they didn't shrink and he still wears them even with the holes because they are just SO NICE. This 2 piece heavy weight set he has had his eye on since the first cold hunting morning this year. He was super happy to find them in his presents, along with some mid weight long sleeves as well. They are all so soft and really comfortable. They have always been true to size and we wash in cold water and dry on low. We will continue to be customers for as long as these products are available! The socks are amazing too!",5
B09C4WJ38S,"So soft, so comfortable - at any size - plus size fits so nicely.",5
B09C4WJ38S,"Fantastic value to price.  I used the bottoms for near freezing temperatures while hiking around Budapest for a week.  I could not use the tops too, as this set is extremely warm, to the point I would recommend it for below freezing, and suggest using the LITE set for above freezing.  I would only suggest the 320 weight for those who are constantly cold or for the average user when it's well below freezing.The quality and texture of the Merino isn't high-end, but it's far better than I was expecting at this price point...especially with a pair of free Merino socks included!If you're looking for a men's base layer that offers the biggest bang for the cost, look no further.  I will say that my wife ordered the women's set and it seems to have the same cut as the men's, so fitment isn't great for women.",4
B09C4WJ38S,This has been washed no more than three times.  Line dried too.  I don't think it should be falling apart this soon.  Otherwise this set is ok,4
B09C4WJ38S,"Great customer service after receiving wrong order, color,size, etc. Resent in 2 days and fixed' comfort and fit are too actual size and warm always without sweating all day' 4 all you who aren't aware this material is all the buzz in hunting world and good reason' warm,soft, yet breathes, got the 250 and under scrubs for work never cold in the teens and never hot or sweating inside' try some other companies charge more for the same thing build quality overall pretty good but the customer service will help you get what your looking for and to your standards will buy more 4 sure'",5
B09C4WJ38S,"Most comfortable thing I've ever worn. The 3XL is true to size. If you're between 3-4X, this will fit you, maybe even 4XL. It's worth you trying on, even if you have to return it if it doesn't fit. This outfit it quality. Fits me very comfortably. Similar to UA Cold Gear, but better. It's not see through, because it's tightly woven. The charcoal grey color is dark charcoal. It is soft and smooth, no itching at all. Highly recommended! I will be purchasing more. If I wasn't so poor, I'd get one set in every color.",5
B09C4WJ38S,I used this mid weight set for my trip to Iceland.  The temps were between 40 and 50 degrees. It was a little warmer than we had expected.  I had a moisture wicking long sleeve tee shirt under my wool top and the bottom were against my skin.  I stayed dry even at the 50 degree mark.  I am about 6 feet tall and weigh around 200 lbs.  I purchased a large.  I was very satisfied with the fit.,4
B00IO9JCY4,These are very comfortable socks seem like they're very well made very cushiony On My Feet very soft on my feet seem like a great body for the money I bought the socks multiple times over the last 5-10 years I will continue buying them as long as the quality stays good and the price stays down I know to the manufacturer keep making these socks I would even like to see them be just a little bit taller on my calf but they work fine the way they are that's just a suggestion maybe make something come up a little taller I don't like over the calf socks that are too short,5
B00IO9JCY4,Comfortable wear.,5
B00IO9JCY4,they are socks,5
B00IO9JCY4,I love Hanes socks. Have been buying these for over 35 years. Best price point for over the calf socks you can get. VERY comfortable.,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Fit perfect for husbands feet, as he has had surgery and now some socks don't fit correctly. But these work great.",5
B00IO9JCY4,"Soft but not very sturdy. They ""fuzz-up"" and get thinner with every wash.",5
B00IO9JCY4,Husband loves these socks although he said they seem to be thinner since the last time I ordered them,4
B00IO9JCY4,"Pros: They do go over calf. I'm 5'8"" size 10 shoe. 12 pair for 12.99. Keeps boots from touching back of calves. They are comfortable for how thin they are. Easy to put on.Cons: Thinner than Fruit of The Loom tube socks but FTL socks didn't go over calf.Doesn't seem that they are going to last, being thin, time will tell. QC seems lacking some socks ar longer than others. Probably not going to be very warm this winter.",4
B00IO9JCY4,They are socks... could be thicker,3
B00IO9JCY4,Fit good,5
B00IO9JCY4,"time will tell.  There isn't a defined heal to the socks just a tube.  The material doesn't seem like the material of the Hanes socks I bought a few years ago.  The price has decreased if I remember correctly, I paid almost $2 a pair and now about a $1 a pair.",3
B00IO9JCY4,"Thick, fair quality sock. Hard to find them at this price! They work for normal wear.",4
B00IO9JCY4,As expected,5
B00IO9JCY4,"First off, I feel misled, these are half-calf length at best. Having only a 28"" inseam, I don't think that's because I'm too tall for them either. ""Cushion"" apparently means the socks are thicker than leggings? I have a pair of novelty socks from Five Below that are handily twice as cushioned. I put these on, went on a 10 minute walk to the convenience store, and by the time I got home they were bunched up at my ankles.To be clear. These ARE in fact socks. Maybe expecting something more from Hanes was my mistake, but this is easily the most disappointing sock purchase I've ever made, and I will be looking to return them. Even if you're satisfied with the quality, I would not recommend this length unless you plan to wear them with halters. Guess I'm just shocked to find that I've been spoiled by the cheap, thin-as-paper, spandex, ""retro style cosplay"" socks from China I've been wearing. These are a hair thicker than those, but at the cost of everything else you could want in a pair of socks.",2
B00IO9JCY4,My husband loves these socks. They're made well.,5
B00IO9JCY4,I gave them to my son fir work socks.  If you could send me the larger size I would appreciate it.,4
B00IO9JCY4,You might want to get a lint remover they work a lot better then the roll on rollers with sticky paper.,3
B00IO9JCY4,Seems to get dingy a little quickly. Overall a good deal.,4
B00IO9JCY4,The only bad side of socks now days is they are made so thin . My husband wears long socks because of his boots . That was his only complaint thin .,4
B00IO9JCY4,"Good product for the money,  lots of brands don't make over the calf Socks , I have used this brand of socks for over 30 years.",5
B00IO9JCY4,"This is an ideal sock for normal everyday wear that provides comfort and a good over the calf fit. No sock lasts forever, but these Hanes socks do manage to keep their share over time. You'll want to look elsewhere in extreme cold circumstances or if you are going to be working hard and sweating a lot in them. This is a good sock, especially for the price.",4
B00IO9JCY4,Haines is always a good brand. Socks are a little shorter than over the calf but maybe my feet are bigger. They are still good quality and good value.,4
B00IO9JCY4,Great over the calf socks!,5
B00IO9JCY4,My husband has purchased Hanes socks for years and will continue to do so for the reliability of fit and where,5
B00IO9JCY4,Purchased for my husband as he wears long socks all the time. They were a little longer than I intended to buy but that is no fault of the socks themselves. I used them myself when I was going to work outside to protect my legs. No complaints.,5
B00IO9JCY4,"I wear a size 13 and originally about them for a costume, but now I use them for my work boots.",5
B00IO9JCY4,His new socks when he needs them.,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Legit full calf sock , well made good quality and ling lasting material.  Bit lighter material  than a gold toe. Otherwise comparable",5
B00IO9JCY4,"Good length,not very good quality. Socks don't stay up. Brand new socks should stay up the leg especially right out the package but these do not spend all day pulling them up.",3
B00IO9JCY4,"Great, but I am a woman, with a small foot - they come right up to my knee, over muscular calves.I find it impossible to find a pair of any kind of socks, especially knee socks these days, that actually fit.  I wear a size 7 shoe with a smallish foot.My husband swiped a pair, and they are smallish on him.",5
B00IO9JCY4,Quality work socks are getting difficult to find.  These fit the bill.,5
B00IO9JCY4,My husband wears them for work and they last nicely,5
B00IO9JCY4,The socks fit perfectly good quality and very comfortable,5
B00IO9JCY4,Shipping was fast and the product was new in packaging. They are good socks but as other reviews have stated a bit thin for a guy who is in construction or in a heavy work job. I will order again as they are more affordable than going to Walmart.,4
B00IO9JCY4,"This product was for my son and he said the elastic on the socks are already bad, socks are not holding up. And he's only worn them twice",3
B00IO9JCY4,"Broke my foot and am wearing an air boot...I got ten times more socks buying these regular socks vs. buying those ""special"" socks made for the boot ....these work great",5
B00IO9JCY4,"These are over-the-calf, not knee high. They tend to sag a little on my chunky calves.",4
B00IO9JCY4,They were not nearly as soft as the last time I bought Hanes tube socks,3
B00IO9JCY4,Wear these because they actually fit my big feet while extending above my work boots .Used to buy these at local retailer but they started locking them in cabinet requiring associate to open for you. Which is as bad as shopping for razors ........,4
B00IO9JCY4,"Can not find tube socks at my local retail stores or online, the only place I have found tube socks is Amazon.Very pleased with socks will definitely buy again",5
B00IO9JCY4,Got these for my dad for the holidays - it was the only thing he asked for - and they were very hard to find in stores. I was very happy to find them on the website and moreover have them come in time for Christmas. He loves them and is very happy.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Husband love tyem,5
B00IO9JCY4,"GOOD PRODUCT, THICK AND SOFT",5
B00IO9JCY4,"I have tried several brands and styles. This one is the best I have found. Comfortable, durable and easy to put on and wear all day.",5
B00IO9JCY4,"I like a lot because it has cushion in the feet!! My son loves this kind of socks that are over the knee because his school is so cold!!He likes the gray the most, but my son is happy with the whites too!!",5
B00IO9JCY4,These are great socks feels good when I wear my work boots will buy again,5
B00IO9JCY4,"They were not as long as I thought, but great socks. Shipped fast.",5
B00IO9JCY4,"I bought these to make chew-toys for my dog now that a tiny plushie costs like $700. I stuff them full of cotton, tie a knot, let my girl rip the guts out, then stuff all the remnants, torn sock and all, into a new sock and the circle of life continues. They grow hugely over time but even after untold generations, the fresh socks are still elastic enough to accommodate the corpses of their war-torn brothers. 10/10",5
B00IO9JCY4,"My husband mentioned that he was getting low on good tube socks. I wanted to make sure he them when he needed them, even if winter is nearly over. These are his favorite kind!",5
B00IO9JCY4,They are comfortable but the material is thin.,3
B00IO9JCY4,"bought a dozen of these, maybe I am stupid,but they are not directional, if you want the logo to be on the top of the foot you gotta make sure you pull 'em on with the logo facing up, maybe it's just me but all the socks I have ever purchased over the last 70 years they actually fit like a shoe, even itchy scratchy Army sock's,",5
B00IO9JCY4,Because I wear boots all day I have to have a sock that I can pull up over my calves and shins to hlep keep the top of the boot from rubbing my leg raw. These kind of socks are getting out of vogue so all you can find is ankle high crews. I was glad I found these and will probably be ordering more in the near future.,5
B00IO9JCY4,For the quantity and price and the socks r soft to boot. Will be buying again definitely,5
B00IO9JCY4,"They are long, soft and it covers over the calf.",5
B00IO9JCY4,"Hanes makes a comfortable sock, but a bit thin for my taste. They are still quality and satisfying socks.",4
B00IO9JCY4,My daughter plays softball. Needless to say white socks get dirty fast. Nice to have a pack on hand at a reasonable price.,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Great socks, fit well. And my feet don't smell after wearing all day. Wish I'd known about these years ago ...",5
B00IO9JCY4,I have bought these socks for years they are very good and comfortable socks.  They last me for years wearing them everyday.  Good value for the price.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Will be great socks for the summer.,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Now these are tube socks, just as they were described, wear and fit perfectly",5
B00IO9JCY4,delivered promptly. product exactly as advertised. much appreciated!,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Good socks for the summer time very breathable, but not good for wearing in construction boots tear fast",4
B00IO9JCY4,Really nice over thigh,5
B00IO9JCY4,"My husband wears boots and some of his socks creep down and he has to pull them back up! So, these are great and he really appreciates that they really stay put!!",5
B00IO9JCY4,Comfortable to wear!,5
B00IO9JCY4,"They are socks. They do what they need to do, what more do you want!",5
B00IO9JCY4,Been buying these for years. Comfortable and just the right mid-calf length.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Good value for the price / quantity.  Not as thick as the socks i grew up with but these days...,4
B00IO9JCY4,They are exactly what I thought they would be and are nice quality for the price point.,5
B00IO9JCY4,"These socks probably wouldn't be over the calf unless your shoe size is well below US 10. As such, they can't wait to fall down. I can take about 3 steps and they're already working their way to my ankles. The fabric is fairly thin, so I don't expect much durability. The foot portion of the sock is fairly comfortable though. Won't bother returning them, but won't be buying them again. Good luck.",4
B00IO9JCY4,I have been wearing this type of sock for over 30 years in all 4 seasons. Need I say more?,5
B00IO9JCY4,nice socks,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Hubby needed over the calf to wear under boots. A little thin, but good price. Same item at walmart,  several $$ more.",4
B00IO9JCY4,love they actually stay up fit good,4
B00IO9JCY4,"good elastic, medium thickness material & fits over the calf on a size 10.5 foot",4
B00IO9JCY4,Fit great very comfortable,5
B00IO9JCY4,Great socks! Great quality!,5
B00IO9JCY4,We have bought these socks for decades now.  They are my husbands go-to socks so we bought 2 big packages of them expecting the same thing we have always bought.  They are much thinner than they used to be and they don't seem to have the same quality of elastic they used to have.  Guess we are now going to be shopping for a different go-to sock,2
B00IO9JCY4,I love tube socks that don't have the heal to make it a crew sock. My husband & I both love Hanes tube socks. Long sock goes up to my knees and up my husband's calf. They help make wearing our motorcycle boots more comfortable.,5
B00IO9JCY4,these socks are not as heavy as the style that has the full gray bottom. socks are lighter and have a tendency to inch down!,3
B00IO9JCY4,To wear on my feet.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Great quality socks and thick.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Item as described. Prompt shipping.,5
B00IO9JCY4,i love these socks for their comfort and feel,5
B00IO9JCY4,"Very well packaged, good quality, going into homeless Blessing Bags so warmth is important. I would buy these socks again. These seem to fit the bill. They are long and will help keep out some of the cold. They are not expensive but they will do a good job.",5
B00IO9JCY4,The only problem is that it should have been inside a bag or box.  NOT SLAP A LABEL ON AND MAIL.The driver said that so many people commented on taking it and not delivering.  NOT GOOD,5
B00IO9JCY4,Fits perfect! My husband loves them.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Quick delivery and exactly what was needed.,5
B00IO9JCY4,Fit well,5
B01GH5KNR6,"I was never really a polo shirt person and, after having the four jobs in a row over the last 16 years where the uniform or dress code basically required a polo shirt or a dress shirt ... I started to understand why polo shirts can be such a tricky thing.  The tricky thing for me is to find the balance between something having thick enough fabric to have its own defined shape so that it fits and looks right ... while not being so thick that it either impedes movements or smothers me.  Further, with a previous brand I initially liked, I discovered the perils of cotton-based materials and that manufacturers may use a vastly different material mixture for different colors ... where, over time, some colors might remain XL because they're only 70% cotton), some might shrink slightly to L, and others might be even smaller than a M because they're 100% cotton.  Just very frustrating when you start off with the exact same brand, product line, and size and then less than 1/3 continue to fit properly.  That's why, when I started looking around for replacements of those I consider unwearable, I was glad to come across this particular polo shirt by Under Armor.  The product quality is  obvious even before putting it on.  And, once it is on, you can tell that it's not just a case of the fabric being a good thickness but that key areas are structurally reinforced not only to make it stronger but to also establish that desired profile.  Being intended for sports, it's also very comfortable to move around in and the relaxed fit and XXL sizing  was the perfect fit.  Even before for me, there is an extremely wide variety of color options ... while all being made from the same material.  Thus, providing me the variety of color choices that I love while avoiding a repeat of that last headache of shirts all starting off the same size originally but then gradually changing completely.  The fact they're also wrinkle-free and can just be rolled up for easy travel is the icing on the cake.",5
B01GH5KNR6,I don't really ride a ton of reviews but I just had to put it out there this shirt fits very well has a nice bit of stretchiness and in my opinion is a very flattering shirt. It's lightweight and very comfortable and I can tell from personal experience that this shirt will not stain easily LOL as I spilled some coffee on it earlier. I like the fit of this shirt so much that I ordered two more in different colors. The almost perfect rating that I'm giving it is only to say that the sleeves could be slightly shorter however they're perfect for the average person but I'm ultimately looking for a shirt that will showcase my arms a little bit better but this does an excellent job. It's really just a nitpick the shirt sits well above my elbow but if you're looking for a very tailored look this is almost perfect. I'm about 5'10 and  around 180 lbs and I ordered Medium so if you're around my height and weight this is going to be the perfect size for you. Amazon recommended that I get a large however I'm very glad I did not as this shirt fits perfect for my body type. Like I said just a slight nit pic that the sleeves could be shorter for maybe my arms as I don't have the longest arms out there by any means but if you have longer arms this shirt is really going to look nicely on you if you're fit. Now if your bit out of shape or whatever this shirt might show that off so it may not be the best idea for you however I imagine if you're buying under armor then you already know that you're looking for a shirt that's going to fit you as a fit person. I do have to mention that I got this on a 50% off sale but for $20 you're not going to find a better polo!,5
B01GH5KNR6,These are very thin but fit well. I need a 3xlt and harder to find. These work.,4
B01GH5KNR6,"I recently purchased this Under Armour Men's Tech Golf Polo, and I must say, I am extremely pleased with this product. From the moment I put it on, I knew I had made an excellent choice.The first thing that struck me was the quality and thickness of the fabric. It feels durable and well-made, providing a sense of confidence that it will withstand regular wear and tear. The material is soft against the skin and has a slight stretch, making it incredibly comfortable to move around in, whether I'm on the golf course or at work.The detailing on this polo is top-notch. Under Armour has paid attention to the little things that elevate the overall look, giving it a sophisticated and polished appearance. The subtle logo and design elements add just the right amount of flair without being too flashy, making it suitable for various occasions.One of the things I love about this polo is its versatility. It truly fits the ""dress-casual"" category, making it suitable for both professional settings and leisure activities. I can easily wear it to the office with a pair of slacks, and then transition seamlessly to a round of golf without feeling out of place.I was so impressed with the first one that I also purchased this polo in multiple colors. Each one looks fantastic, and having a few in the rotation has become a staple in my wardrobe. It's one less thing to worry about when getting dressed, as I know I'll always look put together and stylish with these shirts. I can't explain it, but I feel more confident when I wear this polo.The fit of the Under Armour Tech Golf Polo is spot on. It's not too loose or tight, providing a flattering silhouette that enhances my physique. What's more, I appreciate that it didn't shrink after washing, maintaining its original fit and shape, which is essential for a garment I plan to wear frequently.As for the price, it is reasonable considering the quality and versatility of the product. It's evident that this polo is built to last, making it a worthwhile investment in my wardrobe.In conclusion, the Under Armour Men's Tech Golf Polo is a winner on all fronts. Its excellent quality, thickness, and attention to detail make it a standout choice for anyone looking to add a touch of sophistication to their wardrobe. The ability to dress it up for work or dress it down for play makes it a highly versatile piece. With a great fit and exceptional comfort, it's a pleasure to wear all day long. I highly recommend this polo to anyone seeking a reliable, stylish, and comfortable addition to their clothing collection. I hope my review was helpful to you.",5
B01GH5KNR6,"The quality on these shirts is really nice. Fit is true to size, and the color is as pictured. Really nice and will be ordering more! There is a slight stretch on this material",5
B01GH5KNR6,"I bought these for all my guys at Christmas. Nice shirts, good material, great price!",5
B01GH5KNR6,"I am very picky about my Polo shirts.  The fabric,  the material pattern,  the weight, how well it drapes, how wrinkle resistant it is, how it fits in the shoulders, how the collar stands up,  etc. I've never found a polo shirt I 100% loved until now.First, the shirt fits me Great. The fabric is flexible and stretchy and moves with you.  It's the perfect weight (not too thin),  and the material has a subtle ribbed pattern. The collar is perfect;  it has some structure (isn't all floppy) but is soft and flexible.  The material is wrinkle resistant,  and doesn't show sweat.  It's the perfect golf shirt... after I tried one,  I bought a handful more!",5
B01GH5KNR6,"This is my go to polo shirt, I'm 6ft right at 200lbs and this fits like it was tailored for me. I usually wear a large in T-shirts but for some reason the medium fits me in polos? Anyway the fit is great but just a heads up the black color version of this shirt is slightly shiny for some reason? I have this exact shirt in burgundy and its a matte finish.",5
B01GH5KNR6,"I am not a fan of ordering and not getting it on day it says , which is part of why I order from Amazon.",5

B01GH5KNR6,"The material is not thin, but is not too thick.It fits well. The color is great.",5
B01GH5KNR6,"I love my Under Armour golf shirts. A friend recommended them to me, because I like to wear good polo shirts at work. For years, I picked up cheap shirts from Walmart, Belk, Target, JCPenney, etc.  No more.  These Tech Golf Polo shirts are amazingly comfortable and breathe well.  I live in the south, so I need shirts that breathe well year-round, due to the humidity.  I wear 3X shirts, so I'm a bit sensitive about how shirts fit around my belly (yes, I'm overweight).  These shirts are perfect, because they're not too snug, don't hug my spare tire areas, and don't show my nips and bellybutton (like cheap shirts do).  They also come in a great variety of colors, although I don't go for the neon colors or the flat earthtones that are so washed out.  I tend to go for blues, blacks, grays, and darker colors.  And these are great, because they're almost metallic looking, but in a very cool way.  They also have a secondary color for the logo, collar, and accent areas (most of the time, it's a gray).  And the material also has a nice lined texture that is very subtle (trust me, you'll love it).  And you almost never have to iron them, but if you do, choose lower-temp setting like synthetic.  You do not want to scorch a $30-40 shirt.  If you're a professional who likes to pair a good shirt with some khaki pants, these shirts will compliment your style perfectly (I'm a web guy, so I dig the style of these shirts). They are my go-to source for day-to-day wear.  And if you happen to fall asleep in one of these shirts, you're in good hands, because they sleep really well too. They don't grip or bunch in the arm or collar area.  Trust me, you'll love these.",5
B01GH5KNR6,Great for young college boys,5
B01GH5KNR6,Got a few of these on a lightning deal. Good solid polo for everyday wear and size is true.  I normally wear a large and a large fit well.,5
B01GH5KNR6,Nice,5
B01GH5KNR6,Nice polo,5
B01GH5KNR6,"Very nice item, it now fits me",5
B01GH5KNR6,Muy buen producto,5
B01GH5KNR6,If you want a classy golf shirt that isnt paper thin... This is the one.  Tall sizes make it a win,5
B01GH5KNR6,Looks good on my husband,5
B01GH5KNR6,"Really like the material and the quality of the polo.  Feels substantial, but still breathes and wicks and does all the performance stuff without weighing me down.  Here's my one ""rub,"" and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5:  It is long.  Look, I know I'm a short guy (5'0), but I can never understand who a lot of companies are using as a model for smalls and x-small.  I ordered an x-small in this color and a small in another.  Both are about the same length--and any difference in that is negligible.  And that length is just startling long.  If I pull it down and don't let the stretch, performance naturally pull up a bit, the polo goes super long.  This is just not right for an x-small.  Saving grace:  the chest, shoulders, etc. are what they should be.  And, as eluded, if you let it naturally sit, because of the material and good sizing on the chest, shoulders, and core areas, it ""bunches""--and not absurdly so.  It works, and I'll happily wear it tucked in or out.  I just don't understand the length thing . . . but oh, well.  4 out of 5.  Good buy.",4
B01GH5KNR6,Perfect weight material and true to Size,5
B01GH5KNR6,Muy buena calidad y precio,5
B01GH5KNR6,Arrived on time,5

B01M1OKRTK,I like this sweatshirt way more than I anticipated! Really nice loose fit and the fabric is very comfy soft but tough at the same time!,5
B01M1OKRTK,"Nice sweatshirt for the price, good quality!",5
B01M1OKRTK,"I bought this for my dad and he loved it! It fit perfectly, it's a very soft material, and it will keep him warm.",5
B01M1OKRTK,"Good heavyweight sweater. I already own many of these.. thick and great quality. Gildan is the best heavyweight sweater you can buy. The fit is better than fruit of the loom, who always seems to make the size fatter vs longer in size.",5
B01M1OKRTK,"I bought this sweater to make my husband and I matching Christmas sweaters. I was like eh something cheap for a holiday Sweater.  ITS SO WARM AND THIN SO NOT TOO HOT I don't know if i can explain that correctly.  The inside is so soft and fluffy. The quality is NOT CHEAP. I bought a large and x-large I am a pretty big girl. I am 5'3"" 170 pounds and the large had a cute loose fit not too loose but like a cute loose. I am so glad i bought the black because the iron on color just pops on it. I am so excited I love it to much. It doesn't let me post a picture but I will try and figure it out. Update i have posted a picture with my comment. The iron on really stuck well i love my sweater.  Update to the update I have made his sweater. We didn't match words but it similar so its good. I posted it wearing it so it's a bit big on me but perfect on him. Definitely true to size. Ugh so warm I love it.",5
B01M1OKRTK,This was exactly as expected and the fit was true to size,5
B01M1OKRTK,Very nice and thick,5
B01M1OKRTK,My kids are obsessed with sweatshirts.  Super comfortable and inexpensive.,5
B01M1OKRTK,This is so soft and so warm. I use this for work and my husband even steals it to wear. It does attract animal hard which is a downside but the price cannot be beat!,5
B01M1OKRTK,Soft and comfortable,5
B01M1OKRTK,I'm using this to print my logo on for uniforms edit so far is a soft yet sturdy sweatshirt. I'm happy with it.,5
B01M1OKRTK,These sweatshirts are comfy and make a great gift. Simple and useful!,5
B01M1OKRTK,The item came without packaging only with clear bag. not well protected from weather.the item is exactly what i wanted but i just did not like the way it was shipped.,4
B01M1OKRTK,"Arrived quickly, good quality, light weight.",5
B01M1OKRTK,I have worn these sweatshirts almost daily since I retired.  The quality  is good and they last a long time.  However....I recently replaced 5 of them (they do wear out eventually) with 5 new ones.  Same size (large) as always.  Well.....3 of the 5 are definitely at least XL not L.  Many moons ago I was in the garment business and when we ran out of a certain size we sometimes shipped the next size up (especially if it was a loose garment and one that probably would shrink after washing).  And I think this is what happened on my recent order.  But I cannot return them as I washed/dried them hoping they would shrink - they didn't.  I don't think I will buy this brand again.,3
B01M1OKRTK,"Me facina la calidad del producto , excelente calidad",5
B01M1OKRTK,"Nice and warm, but shrinks a ton",3
B01M1OKRTK,My son loves a classic and simple look and this crew neck sweater did just that.  Very comfy and soft.  An absolute go to sweater! He highly recommends!,5
B01M1OKRTK,Have purchased a couple times - cozy and comfy,5
B01M1OKRTK,"Got this as a gift for my boyfriend (I will be embroidering it for Christmas). He's a size small/medium but loves oversized so I got him a large. I love how it fits me, so I'm sure he'll be comfy in it as well!! Very soft on the inside and feels like a material that won't pill.",5
B01M1OKRTK,I would buy agian,5
B01M1OKRTK,"My husband wears these in winter, loves them.",5
B01M1OKRTK,"Easy to wear and warm, but does not suffocate you!  Great for Winter!",5
B01M1OKRTK,"This sweatshirt is really nice! Great quality especially for the low price. I initially ordered a size Medium, but it fit pretty tight around my hips. I returned it and got two others in Large and they're perfect! This sweatshirt is loose and cozy - perfect for everyday, but also cheap enough that I'm not gonna worry if I ruin it doing fall yardwork.",5
B01M1OKRTK,"I've bought this same sweatshirt over and over and over again in different colors and for different people because the quality is fantastic, the fit is great, and the material is so soft. It's the perfect staple sweatshirt for anyone. I'd say the fit is true to size, so size up if you're looking for a cozier/oversized fit.",5
B01M1OKRTK,I said what I said. LOL,4
B01M1OKRTK,I bought 9 shirts all of them pilled terrible shirts.,1

B01M1OKRTK,Perfect item,4
B01M1OKRTK,This sweatshirt fits well and is very comfortable.  The cuffs don't stay stretched out after I pull them up to my elbows.,5
B01M1OKRTK,"Yeah its decent, if you wipe your mouth on it it will show mucus like semen and food particles get caked into it easily. You can kind of wipe that off but its just a cheap plain sweater so why do you care",4
B01M1OKRTK,So comfy and warm And a size large is a real baggy in the middle 1 if you're used to wearing a size large,5

B01M1OKRTK,This is a great shirt for the price,5

B07VNHNWPL,"I can't speak to the longevity of these socks.  I'm coming from the Hanes low profiles which were ok, but they priced themselves out of the market.I needed socks for my zero drop shoes.  I'm not a fan of socks, but foot stink is no joke.  I read some reviews and these seemed good and priced right.They fit me well (size 10.5)Update:  A week in.  I tried wearing them in my regular waking shoes and the the sock did  not clear the back.  Letting the shoe rub the heal/Achilles tendon area.  Pretty annoying when I couldn't change them for 8 hours on a hot day.I'll try to get back in 6 months or so for the longevity portion of the review.",4
B07VNHNWPL,"These were good quality, but the sizing was off. Too small. Had to ship back.",3
B07VNHNWPL,"For the price there was a Considerable amount of socks. They're quite thin, but my children actually prefer them over the thicker socks. Especially during the summer months.",4
B07VNHNWPL,"super comfortable, perfect height.",5
B07VNHNWPL,Good value for the price. I will purchase again.,5
B07VNHNWPL,"Great price, feel and size.",5
B07VNHNWPL,I use these for work and they don't cause my to sweat since they aren't to thick.,4
B07VNHNWPL,"Feel nice, fit nice. Started to develop holes after 4-6 months of use",3
B07VNHNWPL,"Thic, but fits a bit small",4
B07VNHNWPL,Great gift!,5
B07VNHNWPL,"The socks feel nice, they are breathable and fit well. However, I burnt through all 12 pairs in less than two months. They shrink in laundry and rip very quickly.I expected a better quality product from FOTL",3
B07VNHNWPL,These are low cut ankle socks. They fit perfectly and the material feels soft but well made. I wear them while on my feet 12 hours a day and they still feel great. They have excellent breathablity and do not cause sweaty feet. I can tell these socks will last a long time and for the price they are worth it.,5
B07VNHNWPL,These socks are a joy to wear.  The quality & fit are superior to other brands that I have tried.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Met my expectations,5
B07VNHNWPL,these socks are deece for the money. Fruit of Loom style.,4
B07VNHNWPL,"I like these socks. It fits well, it's comfy and it is relatively cheap.",5
B07VNHNWPL,A bit too small for larger feet (12).,4
B07VNHNWPL,"These are decent black ""low show"" socks. I wouldn't call them ""no show""...but close.I'm a little disappointed in the thin fabric and loose feeling, but still overrall nice socks.",4
B07VNHNWPL,Great value. Soft and comfortable,5
B07VNHNWPL,Good quality comfortable to wear and say to wash,5
B07VNHNWPL,Very comfortable. My everyday go to.,5
B07VNHNWPL,I purchased the fruit of the loom men's dual defense no show socks and was upset. I selected the right size but after to first wash caused the socks to shrink. Please purchase up a size.,3
B07VNHNWPL,"Deep black color. Super soft & comfortable. Breathable to help with moisture. They are cotton, so no worries washing them at any temp.Only downside; they only run up to size 12, I wear a 14, so these are a little tight & can be difficult to use/get on the first time wearing.",5
B07VNHNWPL,"These socks are extremely soft and comfortable.  They do not fall off your ankles when wearing tennis shoes  whether you are walking ,running etc. I can wear them outside and inside and they have not gotten any holes. I will say if you are wearing them on hardwood floors they are slick so you have to be careful, but other than that they are extremely comfortable.",5
B07VNHNWPL,Great value and holds up,4
B07VNHNWPL,at about $1 a pair these are great socks. Not quite no-show as I would've liked but these are good enough for the money and I'm glad I ordered these.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Good price and great quality,5
B07VNHNWPL,These look exactly as seen in display photo. They were purchased for someone.,4
B07VNHNWPL,My husband wears size 11 sneakers.  These socks fall off his heal.  Nice thickness.,3
B07VNHNWPL,"Exactly what I was looking for. Excellent quality good fit I even like the thickness. Came super quick, thanks guys.",5
B07VNHNWPL,"Don't know longevity yet but they are very comfortable. Unless there's an quality issue down the road, I'd buy them again. Fruit of the Loom has been a good brand for me so far so I don't anticipate any quality issues",5
B07VNHNWPL,I love the purchase,4
B07VNHNWPL,"Fit ok, or at least how I like ankle socks to fit. I wear a size 13 shoe. Only issue is I grew accustomed to walking around with just these socks on and got lots of tears, had to throw some away after a while. The material makes my feet sweaty sometimes. But it is really difficult to get socks that are predominantly cotton.",4
B07VNHNWPL,These socks are about medium in thickness and happy to report these no-show socks do not crumple in the back making you have to adjust your socks while walking.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Comfy and fit great,4
B07VNHNWPL,Fits great on my 8.5 size foot and super soft,5
B07VNHNWPL,Very soft and comfortable. My husband loves them!,5
B07VNHNWPL,"This is the best, to date, sock I've ever worn. Super soft, wont make your feet sweat, and aren't too tight on your foot. I am extremely pleased with these and will order more as to have plenty on hand for the future.This, to me, is the perfect sock. Definitely worth the cost.  I will spend the money to have the comfort from this brand anyday.  Hope this review helped!",5
B07VNHNWPL,The Fruit Of The Loom Dual Defense No Show Socks are hands down the very best! The quality is superb and they fit perfectly! The packaging is totally on point and it's a piece of cake to use! I really like that they are moisture wicking and also have odor protection too! I think it's great that 12 pairs come in a pack as well! Overall I give this product two great big thumbs way up and would definitely recommend it!,5
B07VNHNWPL,Comfortable and great price for quantity,5
B07VNHNWPL,These are not compression socks. They are easy to put on and they stay in place comfortably.  At a dollar a pair they are a bargain. I would order more but 12 pair is enough.,5
B07VNHNWPL,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The quality of the socks is excellent. My husband really likes them. He says they are very comfortable and they don't feel thick or hot. They hold perfect moisture and they run below your ankle. The appearance is perfect with any type of shoe.,5
B07VNHNWPL,"I wear a 9.5 or a 10 in shoe, and these socks were big for my feet. It could be with a better fit they would feel more comfortable, but I thought they were a bit rough in texture. I can't imagine a size 6 or 7 wearing them with any success.",3
B07VNHNWPL,Good for someone who needed a whole new wardrobe,5
B07VNHNWPL,"These fit great and they're very comfortable! I like that they are name brand, but not name brand price.  Thank you for having a great deal for a great product!",5
B07VNHNWPL,"Low cut socks, great comfort and quality. I usually don't buy socks until i get wholes etc.. The price on these were great got 2 packs and tossed out my old ones. Great socks",5
B07VNHNWPL,"My husband was happy with these, quality especially. He puts hikes in his socks and were buying a new pack every other week! These last!",5
B07VNHNWPL,I purchased these for my husband and ordered two packs right away. He told me he really likes that they're comfortable but thin so he doesn't feel like his feet are as sweaty by the end of the day.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Think and soft good ankle sock,5
B07VNHNWPL,Initially I bought this to meet the $35 requirement for free shipping. These ended up being my daily socks and wear this everyday.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Very comfy and very true to size,5
B07VNHNWPL,Barely fits. But they do fit. A bit smaller than I like. I'm a size 11 in men,5
B07VNHNWPL,Great socks for a nice price. Soft feeling and comfortable,5
B07VNHNWPL,I have a size 12 wide foot these barely cover my heal,3
B07VNHNWPL,"Bought these for my son and he's not complaining and likes him and they are quality, not too thick but not too thin",5
B07VNHNWPL,"Ordered 32 pairs of socks at the same time, dickies, fruit of the loom (Dual Defense) & gold toe. The Gold Toe socks wore out first, then the Dickies and the fruit of the loom socks are still good! All 3 socks were comfortable, fruit of the loom socks were the cheapest.",5
B07VNHNWPL,Very impressed with these socks. Wear and wash very good.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Nice cozy socks. Not thick or super thin  Not a true no show but they are low cut. I would purchase again.,5
B07VNHNWPL,These socks were a great deal and they are very comfortable no shows that do not slip off in shoes.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Muy buen producto,5
B07VNHNWPL,Bought for my grandson.  He really likes them.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Good quality comfortable,5
B07VNHNWPL,I have had this batch for awhile. They are very comfortable and are holding up to daily sport use. They are also actually no show. Highly recommend.,5
B07VNHNWPL,"Definitely not size 6-12.  I'm a 10 1/2 and the heel portion is at my ankle.  Also, they're pretty thin - almost dress socks.",3
B07VNHNWPL,Very good sock. Fits well on feet.,5
B07VNHNWPL,"Very durable, and comes out of the wash multiple times just as soft as they went in. My only gripe is that the  ankle band is just a bit too snug, and you can feel it on the front a little too much. I purchased the ""Fruit of the Loom mens 12 Pair Pack Dual Defense Cushioned Casual Sock, Black, 6-12"" and I wear a 9 1/2 wide, and they fit my actual foot perfectly.",4
B07VNHNWPL,For as you would expect.,5
B07VNHNWPL,"I ordered 3 packs, one for myself and 2 kids, and I only got 1 pack... I was very disappointed. The socks themselves are wonderful, but instead of having 12 pair a piece, we only get 4...",3
B07VNHNWPL,Seem sturdy and economical,5
B07VNHNWPL,They are ftloom quality. They don't stretch out of shape. Comfortable.,5
B07VNHNWPL,I love these socks,5
B07VNHNWPL,"This product does not wick the sweat from your feet, I dont like sweaty feet so I gave the socks away",2
B07VNHNWPL,Nothing wrong with the socks. They just don't go up as high on my ankles as I was expecting.,3
B07VNHNWPL,Love the fit.  Great price for all of the pair of socks you get.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Love these socks very good value,5
B07VNHNWPL,Found the Fruit of the Loom socks to be thicker than expected. Higher quality product than other brands. Would recommend to anyone who wants quality socks and a fair price.,5
B07VNHNWPL,Great quality,5
B01MA6CY8L,"Overall I'm pretty happy with my purchase.  I'd say these definitely have the look I was going for.  My main gripe is that I wish there was more flex/stretch in the knees.  When I move, bend, or sit, the stretch sensation feels like the pants are tighter than they really are.  It's something that's hard to ignore while I'm wearing them, which is preventing these a bit from being my go-to pants.  So while I'd say they run true to size, and look good, the feeling during movement is where I am having the most issues.  I will keep these pants but probably would not repurchase another pair if I had the chance.",4
B01MA6CY8L,"So I'm 5'8"" 158lbs and I ordered Medium. They are a little looser in size and length than I anticipated but I got used to that very quickly. I wear them for my 5am jog to the gym and they keep my legs nice and warm although they aren't thick like sweatpants. Great value for the money because they are well made, have nice zipper pockets for your phone and a great thick waistband. I would recommend and if you are someone who is looking for a slimmer fit you can probably get away with a size smaller because I know I could wear a small if I wanted vs medium.",5
B01MA6CY8L,Love the way these fit will be buying more in different colors,5
B01MA6CY8L,"comfy and easy fit, material feels nice, not too thin or thick. Washes really well",5
B01MA6CY8L,Good quality for sure. Got it for my man and he loves it,5
B01MA6CY8L,"We have four boys that are between 17 and 25. Each one got a pair of these for Christmas. The four boys cannot be any different in size or personality or interests , but each of them loved this pair of lounge pants. One of them equated it to yoga pants for men.  I was able to purchase these in the fall during a limited time deal and was able to get them for approximately $25 each, which made them an excellent value.",5
B01MA6CY8L,I hate pants. But these are nice!!!,5
B01MA6CY8L,Large runs tight. Perfect for running; constricting for loungewear,4
B01MA6CY8L,"Love they have zippered pockets, go to vacation pant so I know my wallet and phone is safe in the zipped pockets",5
B01MA6CY8L,Love these pants very nice,5
B01MA6CY8L,These pants are very comfortable and true to size.  I wear an XL and they fit perfectly.,5
B01MA6CY8L,Love them!,5
B01MA6CY8L,"I have them on, fresh out the package as I write this. They are alot thinner than Nike tech fleece, but they are comfy. Im a XL but would prefer a lil more waist room, but not a deal breaker. They are more of the baggier side but ankles are tappered. The zippers on the pockets are a nice touch. I would wear em when its cool outside, not cold. Worth a try",4
B01MA6CY8L,They run big.,4
B01MA6CY8L,Good material and price,5
B01MA6CY8L,"This joggers are very comfortable, true to size",5
B01MA6CY8L,Fits my 13 yo perfect and he loves them!,5
B01MA6CY8L,Bought them for my son for college. He loves them.,5
B01MA6CY8L,Good joggers,4
B01MA6CY8L,Nice fit and look good,5
B01MA6CY8L,"i may have do XXXL next time, of course Under Armour XL is what most places call L  .",5
B01MA6CY8L,My grandson likes them. He and I like that it doesn't look boring. Like the style.,5
B01MA6CY8L,"He loves the brand  of clothing. He likes black warm up pants. He likes there comfortable fit. This brand is expensive. There light weight. They rip like any other pants do. If you use them to play rough. He get a lot of use from them. We are going to pay patch, it mend them with. I have to locate patches with pictures and word on them. To make them stylish looking.m for him. To get use to repairing and sewing Aldo mending. I want to teach him to use them for playing. To value my money!",5
B01MA6CY8L,Size fit and wear often.,4
B01MA6CY8L,My husband loves these - comfortable and look great,5
B01MA6CY8L,"I bought a pair of these joggers and a pair of Nike joggers. In the long run the nike joggers stitches started tearing. And they cost $60 each.On the other hand, this under armor joggers are lasting me longer and fit me better.P.S I use them for the gym.In case this helps.",5
B01MA6CY8L,Perfect fit. Very comfortable. Good for the gym or casual activity.,5
B01MA6CY8L,It nice,5
B01MA6CY8L,"Great wear item, comfortable takes abuse and wears well.",5
B01MA6CY8L,These joggers are fantastic.  I have owned other brands of this type of jogger and they are not as comfortable and fit great. Zipper pockets are perfect and nice length for someone who is 6'2.,5
B01MA6CY8L,Fit as expected. Good material,5
B01MA6CY8L,These pants look and fit great. Roomy near thighs and tapered after the knees - just what I needed for workouts.,5
B01MA6CY8L,Will buy these again,5
B01MA6CY8L,Some of the best sweats I have. Could do without the zipper pockets,5
B01MA6CY8L,"The material tends to pill after a month.  The fit is very snug, especially in the calfs (because it's tapered).  I recommend going up a size.  On the plus size, the hand pockets have zippers.  The waist elastic band is super strong and can keep your pants up without the ties even.",3
B01MA6CY8L,"These joggers fit well, look nice and have a premium feel. Great price and shipping was quick.",5
B01MA6CY8L,"Great price for will fitting sweatpants, I like the fleece on the inside giving you a little insulation and keeping you warm. Pockets are deep with zippers which for me is a bonus.",5
B01MA6CY8L,"I ordered two for my husband. He works in the sports field, it is very difficult to find pants with a zipper and that are comfortable. We loved these because they have a zipper, the zipper is thick and durable. The material of the pants is elastic and cotton on the inside. Totally recommended.",5
B01MA6CY8L,Comfortable but does pile in between thighs.,4
B01MA6CY8L,"I order my son in law's regular size, medium, and laughed out loud when I opened the package. There is no way these are made to fit a size medium full grown man. Unstretched and laying flat, the waist measures 14 inches across. The size chart says they're for 31-34 inch waists.",3
B01MA6CY8L,I like under armour and the brand itself is fine. Problem is I waited weeks and ordered two. One was correct another was an Amazon return shows on the green bag and someone switched it out for an entirely different cheap brand. This has happened numerous times this year to me. Very frustrating when Amazon is supposedly checking these.. make sure your order is correct.,3
B01MA6CY8L,"Within next four weeks, i'm getting another pair",5
B01MA6CY8L,It runs small,3
B01MA6CY8L,Great joggers. I bought two pair (Med & Lrg). I ended up keeping the large.,5
B01MA6CY8L,My boyfriend loves this line of performace wear; this particular item has a nice stream line fit and its lightweight.,5
B01MA6CY8L,It's perfectly,5
B01MA6CY8L,"Even though I don't love them i have to admit these pants are great quality. Pockets zip nicely. Fit just right except they are a little long. I have a 33"" inseam and these puddle around the bottom.  I think they would fit someone with a 35"" inch inseam just right.I tried to shrink them a little by drying them, but it didn't happen.  I own a couple of pairs of a different style UA joggers and was wanting to add one more. These are not it. They are more like sweats with a band at the bottom of the leg.",4
B01MA6CY8L,"These things are pretty comfortable, I still haven't found joggers that don't encourage a bit of chafing but I look forward to trying these when the weather cools down again. I'll update my review if I find out that I'm wrong about the Comfort level during a run or something. But around the house they are pretty nice but a little tighter on my legs",4
B01MA6CY8L,Always had good luck with Under Armour ended up getting these at 70% off so great marketing. I like the zip up pockets. They work well for the gym.,5
B01MA6CY8L,I love the look and they are very warm for fall season,5
B01MA6CY8L,"I liked the look,style and fit plus the cost. Gies great with everything.",5
B01MA6CY8L,Excelente,5
B01MA6CY8L,Fits goodTop qualityFeels great,5
B01MA6CY8L,"Comfortable, good material, light weight worth the price",5
B01MA6CY8L,Feel so much better,5
B01MA6CY8L,These are just a great pair of joggers  for casual wear or the gym. Good pockets and great material a little snug but besides that I see why people buy multiple pairs of these pants. I highly recommend.,4
B01MA6CY8L,"I mean, they're pants. They're good, but I don't know if they're worth $24 on their own. I only work out at home, so I don't need the zipper pockets, but I can see how people who work out outside would need to drop the extra cash for something like that.",4
B01MA6CY8L,"Bought for a gift. He likes them, very comfortable. Great price too!",5
B01MA6CY8L,"I've been buying these pants in different colors for years, and I loved this one!",5
B01MA6CY8L,"True Size , good quality for the price, thank you !",5
B01MA6CY8L,Love it,5
B01MA6CY8L,"After ordering numerous brands for a jogger pant to wear around town I finally found the right one.The Under Armor fit perfect for me and I wanted a back pocket for the phone, which was harder to find then you would think. The material is high quality and the value for the money is fair. The less expensive brands had quality and fit issues (I ordered large and XL for comparisons) and the fit was all over the board. Under Armor fit as expected and is a quality brand. You get what you pay for.",5
B01MA6CY8L,"Un poco estrecho, pero se ve bien...",4
B01MA6CY8L,"comfortable and great for gym. only downside is the dual pockets. it's very annoying when my keys fall in the side pocket and then i have to fight it out of my pocket cuz i'm reaching into the main pocket. i dont know the purpose of having 2 pockets inside each pocket, but it's not a good design.",4
B01MA6CY8L,"Comfortable, cozy, and reasonable price.",4
B01MA6CY8L,Great for long cardio sessions,5
B01MA6CY8L,Great sweatpants except for the weird double pocket on the right side. I had to cut it out because I struggled to put/keep my large phone in the pocket.,4
B01MA6CY8L,La calidad del producto es excelente.,5
B01MA6CY8L,"My son will pretty much only wear these running pants loves the style, comfort and is tall and slender. Loves being comfortable. Teenagers!",5
B01MA6CY8L,I love them I just have to order a xL this time,5
B01MA6CY8L,"Picked these up on a sale, really like how they fit. Perfect alternative to the adidas tiro pants",5
B073TW4BV6,"I hope this comment helps you in some way. Take the time to investigate where to buy your elegant suit, the company or brand, the comments (quantity) in relation to the star rating, all of that influences and using a tape measure will help you a lot. I want to tell you that this elegant suit is excellent, the measurement, the color, the fabric, everything feels quality in relation to the price obviously, it is a very good option, this is size L, I am 1.90cm tall, pants size 34, shirts size L. I highly recommend this suit!!!!",5
B073TW4BV6,"We have received so much cheap garbage from Amazon out of the Far East lately that we are continuously frustrated with Amazon's decline.  So, I hesitated to even order this suit thinking it was going to be cheaply made or four sizes too small, yet advertised as a 3XL. However, we were pressed for time so I gambled on Amazon. Shockingly, I was extremely impressed with this order.  This suit, with an inexpensive price, is well made and fits my son very well. It is too large in the belly, but to fit over large shoulders and arms, we must choose 3XL to 4XL. I can just move the button over to trim up the waist line of the jacket, and for the pants he can just wear a belt. I am so pleased to have a jacket that fits his shoulders, that is well stitched, and at a great price. Thank you for some good quality merchandise!",4
B073TW4BV6,I got a XS for my son's Semi formal at his school. He looked soooo good in this suit!  The pants are a little long for his taste but honestly normal length but that no problem i was able to hem them to his liking and they fit good around his waist. Jacket fit good. My son is slim athletic build about 5ft 7in and 116 lbs. The color was nice a very nice white.,5
B073TW4BV6,"Great suit for the price, pants run a little big, but we made it work! Would definitely buy again!",5
B073TW4BV6,"Ordered for my husband last minute for a formal event after had trouble with suit from another company.  Delivered in less than 24 hours. Fit great with no alterations needed. I did need to steam it because it was wrinkled, but that is to be expected.  Looked better than the very expensive suit I originally bought. Looked just as good or better than everyone at the event, many in tuxedos.  My husband said it was very comfortable.  Actually had a bit of stretch too it! Could not be happier.",5
B073TW4BV6,"Short review: I'm 5'10, 148-150lbs and the size XS fit me perfectly, but the pants are too tight and would have to try on a different size (I'm a size 31 waist). The size Small itself it a little baggy on shoulders and sides on the jacket/vest.So I bought a Navy blue and dark blue to compare the difference in color. Navy blue arrived and it was a suit with no tag on the inside collar, but the brand tag attached to the suit that it came with says Cooper and Nelson, NOT Mage Male. But overall? That one felt nice for the price. I ended up returning the Cooper and Nelson suit. Color and style wasn't for me. It's not the same suit/style as described or shown in this post. It looks way too plain.My dark blue one came in and it was the actual Mage Male brand as shown on this listings here. These two are way different material/fabrics. Mage Male is a bit more stiff and thick. Whereas this Cooper and Nelson felt like a normal suit.The pocket styles and fit was really different.Mage Male Dark blue felt a little more fitted but it was still ok to wear. .The Cooper and Nelson has a plain pocket style, no pocket slit of a second color as shown in the Amazon post here. But yeah I just thought it was weird to receive a whole different brand suit lol",4
B073TW4BV6,The suit is pretty decent quality for the price. Thick fabric. Pants have adjustable stretch to them.,4
B073TW4BV6,"My mother in law passed. We had to find suits ASAP. Got on Amazon and found this beauty. It has size charting, measured my husband and we were so happy with this suit. The service from Amazon was amazing. We really needed this order to come through without any hiccups. Great suit, true service Amazon. Knocked it out of the ballpark. We thank you",5
B073TW4BV6,good product for great price,4
B073TW4BV6,"I'm not going to say this is the best suit in the world. However, if you're a person that doesn't wear suits that often or just needs a suit for one occasion .....I would go with this. The first suit I bought was a 3X it ended up being a little too small sent it back...  got the 4X it perfectly. Comes with the pants, jacket,vest and a Bowtie. I would suggest getting it steamed. Don't try to use a iron. Pretty satisfied with the buy.",4
B073TW4BV6,Loved the product. Excellent tailoring and it's one of my most used products. Ordered two colors. I would recommend it anytime.,5
B073TW4BV6,My husband bought the suit for an 80s prom themed dance. We thought it would be very cheap feeling and questionable fit. My husband is 61 and weighs approximately 205 pounds. Surprisingly the fabric was not that bad. The suit fit him as if it were tailored to him. We are considering buying a black one and actually using it for other occasions because it fits him so well. Definitely worth the $79.,5
B073TW4BV6,"Lovely suit. Material wasn't irritable, however, alterations definitely will be needed. You could get it cheaper elsewhere.",4
B073TW4BV6,Perfect fit for my husband!,5
B073TW4BV6,"Fits perfectly Am 5'11"" 185-190lb usually wear size M. this is size M. Tru to size good material wrinkles como out easy with steamer. You can go wrongMageMale  3pc suit. Expandable waist love it",4
B073TW4BV6,It's a nice color but the materials kind of cheap looking,5
B073TW4BV6,This MAGE suit set is way better than the other brand I tried. The size is a good fit. The style looks cool. The price is reasonable. Love it.,5
B073TW4BV6,"This is true to size, I bought my husband an XXL and it fit him perfectly and he loved it, thinking of getting a few more of these suits for him",5
B073TW4BV6,The feel of the suit is ok. My only complaint was that I found the pants a bit snug until I tried to button them and feel it give that added stretch made this a perfect suit for me and at the price. Btw I got the 3X,4
B073TW4BV6,I would order this item again.,5
B073TW4BV6,Good,5
B073TW4BV6,Good,5

B073TW4BV6,My son is autistic and his current obsession is suits. He also LOVES gold/yellow. We got hun this for Christmas and not only does it fit perfect he looks so good!!! Will be buying more in every color!Size largeAge 135ft 9in175lbs,5
B073TW4BV6,We choose to buy instead of rent for our sons school dance. This actually ends up saving us a ton of money because he can wear again next year.,5
B073TW4BV6,Used for prom and it fit really nicely,4
B073TW4BV6,"I this suit was awesome!! I was going on a cruise for 7days to Mexico, and friend asked me to get a suit that matched her dress, a Italian dark green. I was going to different shop places trying to find the right color and right size. All the shops was out! Either they had the right color, but not the size. I was running out of time. So I took a chance and ordered this suit. And wow, it came fast, and I was very shocked it fit so good. The thing I had to do is shorten of the pants leg a little at the local seamstress shop. I am 6'0"" 230 , and I got the the 3XL. The quality is of very good material, and  the pants can be adjusted in or out, the vest fit perfectly and is adjustable as well. Even came with adjustable bow tie. At the captains dinner on the cruise ship I received alot of compliments and praises. The suit was a hit!!!!",5
B073TW4BV6,"I needed a specific color suit on short notice for a wedding, and didn't want to spend too much. Took a gamble on this, which I was hesitant to do because it doesn't have standard suit sizes; only this sizing chart. I took my measurements carefully and according to the chart, I needed a small. I nearly bought a medium on instinct and based on the other reviews, but decided to trust the chart. Turns out the chart was correct. The suit fits exactly as the sizing chart said it would, which unfortunately also meant that the waistcoat was a little snug. I didn't need the waist coat though, so the pants and jacket fitting were all that mattered. The suit was a little wrinkled coming out of the bag, but either a careful ironing or letting it hang will help. The pants having elastic hidden in the waist is a great feature. I would recommend this suit to anyone who needs one on the cheap in a hurry, BUT make sure you measure yourself carefully and check the size chart.",5
B073TW4BV6,"Good enough material for the price, it did fit my husband like a glove. The color was bright .",4
B073TW4BV6,I had order those tux for my brother to wear for his funeral. He looked sharp and nice. Fit beautiful on him,5
B073TW4BV6,PERFECT FIT!!!!!!!!!  Ordering another color ASAP!  I wanted see how it fit before ordering another one.,5
B073TW4BV6,"I am a wider guy everything fit well except jacket which was a lil snug in the shoulders, but was still wearable",4
B073TW4BV6,"I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for one stitch came undone before I received it. (Very small easy fix) And the padding for the shoulders is gonna need some adjustments but understandable since it comes in the mail and is manufactured in China. Overall a great suit for the money I would recommend or buy again. I bought the regular black suit with pants, vest, bow tie, and jacket.",4
B073TW4BV6,"I took another commenter's suggestion to measure myself and then use the next size up (I went Small) and it fitted me quite well. You are getting what you pay for in materials, but the looks of it are pretty good, and a good value for the man who needs a suit for an somewhat fancy occasion (like attending a wedding), but doesn't want to shell out $200 to rent.",4
B073TW4BV6,This three piece suit is elegant and the size I order was exact and fits very nicely,5
B073TW4BV6,"size a la medida, muy bueno",5
B073TW4BV6,True to size,4
B073TW4BV6,"Suit was nicely made for the price.  Jacket fit well; similar to a boy's 18 or 20 with slightly longer sleeves and length.  The pant waist was much too big. The size chart gave X-Small as being just under 30"".  It measured a full 32.5 inches. The dark gray is slightly more gray, less black than it appears online.",3
B073TW4BV6,"Fit was perfect,style was fantastic",5
B073TW4BV6,Fits well,5
B073TW4BV6,I was very happy when I received my three piece suit. It looks just like it was advertised and it fit even better. I am going to look very handsome on my wedding day in this week.,4
B073TW4BV6,Great quality a little bit even though we got the smallest size.,4
B073TW4BV6,We. Love the  size and. Style,5
B073TW4BV6,"I had purchased this for a cruise for formal night and was really nervous about how it was going to fit and look, but once I received it, it was actually pretty good material it looked great and fit perfect. The only thing that you have to purchase to go along with it is the white button up dress shirt, but it comes with everything else vest jacket, bowtie, pants. Super great purchase and definitely would recommend!",5
B073TW4BV6,I was skeptical about the measuring instructions but I followed them and it fit perfect.Good job.  Amazing quality for the price.,5
B073TW4BV6,It works though. Overall im glad that I bought it.,4
B073TW4BV6,The suit was nice quality had to get it altered for his height but overall it was really nice,5
B073TW4BV6,The suit quality and colour is impeccable. It fit exactly like we wanted it to. The Blue was exactly the blue that was advertised. I definitely recommend purchasing the suit. Delivery was on time. Bought a Size Small,5
B073TW4BV6,The material was not all the good. And it didn't fit right. Had to get it tailored.,3
B073TW4BV6,I like the color it was perfect the size was spot on but what I didn't like is that it was packaged in a small plastic bag folded and stuffed in the mail box.,4
B073TW4BV6,"This suit was perfect for my son! His favorite color is purple, so finding a purple suit was hard. I ordered a few months early and the fit was perfect. For reference, he is 6'3"", 230 lb. I was worried it would be too short, but it was great. His dance was postponed a few months, and when he went to try on day of, it was a little tighter on the bottoms as he had gained a few pounds. The front pocket split a little and I could see his underwear, but thankfully the jacket covered it. Overall I recommend!",4
B073TW4BV6,Very good compared to the price. I recommend it.,5
B073TW4BV6,"Fits perfectly, outstanding color ,love it.",5
B073TW4BV6,The company was willing to work with us when the vest was too small.  Overall suit was perfect for our occasion!,5
B073TW4BV6,My son decided last minute that he wanted to go to junior prom. Fast shipping he was able to try it on first one was too big so we ordered a size down and he received it the next day. He was happy with it and he looked very nice.,4
B073TW4BV6,Coat and vest are to small,5
B073TW4BV6,Good enough . Need undershirt,3
B00CEIU7JU,"These hold their shape, fit and color very well. They are tagless inside and the waistband and seams are covered fabric. Very comfortable cut and style. Minimal shrinkage so far. Good value for money.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Fits well. Very soft, great material, great colors variety, great price, great design. Like would last a long time. Pretty stretchy too. Happy with my order, thanks.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Was skeptical on sizes... mainly due to industry sizing standards changing since early 2000s.  Medium is large due to muscular fit builds.  So I ordered large for my fit large tall 33 waist.  They fit like what I had hoped for, moving from true boxers due to lack of options.  I don't know why mens briefs are being sold in variations like woman's knickers but it's gotta stop! Real cotton briefs or silk true boxers for me.  Why spend over $20 for briefs that have a seam right in the middle that rides up against you? Women wear seamless knickers for good reason.  If it were fashion to display what you're wearing and your package size down below then flaunt your money.  Just seems a waste of money to impress gym mates on underwear.  Women appreciate classic look if that is all you wear around the house in the morning.  Otherwise it's too much ""this is all that I am"".  Bold colors and neat clean fit makes wearing practically nothing on a lazy Saturday day at home well accepted.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"This mens cotton underwear is a little unique in it's design.  The waistband is very narrow which prevents it from folding over when you move and bend.  Also, there is no label sewn in the back of the shorts.  There is a small label sewn on the outside, left front side of the shorts about the size of a postage stamp which is never felt by the wearer.  I like them so well I ordered a few more of them because the last thing I want to do is try to buy them later only to find out that they no longer make them!  The only issue I have had with one pair is that a thread came loose on the waistband and before I knew it, it had pulled out some of the locking stitches in the waistband.  Once I discovered it, I tied a knot in it and cut off the excess thread and so far it has been staying together.  Nice product at a reasonable price.",5
B00CEIU7JU,Great fit and very comfortable. No shrinkage when washed the first time.,5
B00CEIU7JU,All good!,5
B00CEIU7JU,"I have worn white Hanes Briefs for decades then changed to colored briefs from another brand to keep washing simpler by washing all of my clothing together in cold water. I wasn't happy with the new brand because they were a little too big but they had a very comfortable waist band. I decided to go back to Hanes briefs that were colored instead of plain white expecting them to fit like they always did and I normally wore Medium or Large. So, I ordered two sets of 6 and washed them in cold water. I thought the color choices were a little ugly, but I decided to ignore that. But the first time I put one on I was surprised to find that it was far too small and tight, especially at the waist band that dug into my waist. I had washed all of them so I can't send them back. So I will eventually throw them away after I find another brand that's more comfortable.",3
B00CEIU7JU,"Girlfriend colorfully claims these briefs keep her favorite lolly parts safe, warm, and protected. She rates them 5 stars.Whoops. I have to go. She wants to reevaluate them.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"The 100% cotton is comfortable, however the material is thinner than my last Hanes underwear.  I put the two side by side. They are a bit of a granny high rider underwear.",4
B00CEIU7JU,Quality,5
B00CEIU7JU,Wears well and comfortable.,5
B00CEIU7JU,Great fit long lasting,5
B00CEIU7JU,"OK, confession. I hate boxers. I just do, and clearly there are guys like me out there who want a little support down there. I tried boxer briefs, but the ""legs"" ride up and clump in my area down there.I decided to go back to ""tighty whities"" but I did not want white. All the big-box stores do not seem to carr these Hanes with the comfort waste band anymore, so I ordered them.Just as I remembered - Fit nice and snug, comfortable, and no scratchy waistband. Tossed out all my old undies and replaced with these.I just wish they had a ""black and grey"" or ""all black"" package, but I will deal with the more ""racy"" colors LOL, who really cares anyway... Its all about comfort.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"These undies are mostly comfortable, except for the ones are are not 100% cotton, there are two in the pack that are 75% cotton and 25% polyester, those are a bit itchy and hot.  The leg openings do not come loose over time like other Hanes products.",4
B00CEIU7JU,"I am buying these a second time as the first order came and I was pleased. The comfort level is good. The size was true to what was listed. After washing they do get a little more ""relaxed"" and eventually after many washes they will become loose as the cotton wears and stretches .  This only becomes a problem at the leg holes or elastic around the legs. The waist holds pretty well.  The leg elastic gets a little loose over time and that creates a bit of a problem with the ""boys"" not being held in place well.  I have started washing new briefs in cold water and sometimes I wash by hand which seems to help the issue, but is a bit of a pain.",4
B00CEIU7JU,Tiny bit tighter fit than the standard tightly whites. Color can be a nice change.,5
B00CEIU7JU,i like this underwear because it's soft waist band.  but the size does vary.  i bought 4 packs.  2 medium packs had consistent size.  2 large pack were not consistent as one pack was noticeable larger than the other.  still i like them.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"comfortable,  fit well. ( medium size)con:  well out relativily quickly at the top edge",4
B00CEIU7JU,"Would like a to order again cannot find themOn my previous order list. Please help.The durability, comfort, and holds color greatMy husband loves the fit",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Nice heft to the fabric, comfortable, well-made.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"The feel good, don't ride up, only complaint I have is brand logo has relatively sharp edges that can be uncomfortable",4
B00CEIU7JU,Worked as advertised.,5
B00CEIU7JU,great experience,4
B00CEIU7JU,"Perfect leg hole elastic, perfect crotch width, room in front, and not too tight on the waistband. Nothing has fit this good for me since the Kmart Joe Boxers, which are still available, but WILL NOT ship to the US, Before this I had the black Calvin Klein briefs, which were okay but the waistbands would roll up lengthwise, and you had to purposely stretch the front out to have enough room. I am about to buy two more packages of these, SO happy to find briefs that FIT!!!!!",5
B00CEIU7JU,returned,4
B00CEIU7JU,"""Hanes makes me feel good all under. Hanes makes me feel good.""",5
B00CEIU7JU,"The waste bands were designed so as they would not stretch out after months of use , all while giving comfort and breath ability while wearing them even . Very supportive but not binding.",5
B00CEIU7JU,Good fit and good price,5
B00CEIU7JU,I will definitely be buying more of these. This is my transition from boxers to briefs.,4
B00CEIU7JU,Excellent,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Perfect fit, perfect comfort, perfect quality, perfect price....win-win!",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Good price , get exactly as advertised",4
B00CEIU7JU,Perfect fit and comfortable,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Love, love, love these underwear.  The length is perfect not slipping down like a tiny bikini or swimming in boxers.  The fabric covered waist band is so comfortable instead of a giant rubber band gouging into the mid section.",5
B00CEIU7JU,Was able to keep my package in ok,4
B00CEIU7JU,I absolutely love these briefs! They are so comfortable. They don't ride up your thigh. I ordered 3 packs of these because they so comfortable!! Best briefs I've ever purchased!,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Out of respect for the reader, I'll refrain from photos.  I had to search to find underwear that  weren't ""boxer briefs"".  Who invented those, anyway?  I'll go commando before I'll cinch my thighs halfway down.  But here I've found my favorite kind of ""tighties"", with cloth covering the waistband.  There's never been a more comfortable style of underwear, and if that pole vaulting guy had been wearing these, he would have a gold medal right now!",5
B00CEIU7JU,Not going to post you picture...it's just basic underwear in an assortment of colors.  Seem well made and a good value.  I bought a second pack after getting the first one...satisfied customer,4
B00CEIU7JU,"I originally bought some of these at walmart and loved them, but couldn't find them anymore for a long time. Saw these on amazon and ordered two packages. Colors were slightly different than before but still very comfortable and seemed to be made the same. I would order them again if I need more. I ordered the X-large and should be fine if I lose some more weight or gain some. The original order is a couple of years old and no sign of falling apart.",5
B00CEIU7JU,Nice quality,5
B00CEIU7JU,"These are fine underwear, low enough to be inconspicuous and supportive enough for ""containment"".  The directions caution against drying them in a drier, but I have a problem seeing underwear as needing special treatment, so I ignored the directions and dried them... and they shrunk.  Now I am following directions and they are stretching back out, but if I plan to use a drier in the future I will need to order one size larger.",4
B00CEIU7JU,fits perfectly.  will order again,5
B00CEIU7JU,quedan bien,5
B00CEIU7JU,The fabric and fit have been excellent.  Great value for the money,5
B00CEIU7JU,size is perfect fit,5
B00CEIU7JU,Works as expected. Zero issues.,5
B00CEIU7JU,Sizing is a bit larger than expected.  Next time I'll go down 1 size than normal. And the high rise is too high. I'll get mid rise next.time.,4
B00CEIU7JU,"Hanes Men's Underwear Briefs, Mid-Rise, Moisture-Wicking, 6-PackThe fit is off! These fit good on my waist but crotch is baggy",3
B00CEIU7JU,Like,4
B00CEIU7JU,All fit as expected,5
B00CEIU7JU,Nicest undies I've had in a while or maybe ever. A mix between a bikini and briefs. They really are comfy too. The colors are awesome. Hanes is consistent. Can't really do a pic...,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Always liked Hanes products. They shrink a little at the waistband, but the leg elastic gets looser over time. Not really an issue.",4
B00CEIU7JU,It fits and feels great! Love the support. Comfortable and no ride up. No more red spots and bumps on my legs and no chaffing,5
B00CEIU7JU,"They are comfortable and well made, not overly snug like some brands.",5
B00CEIU7JU,They are very good,5
B00CEIU7JU,I really like these briefs.  They fit well around my legs and don't ride up. Bought another set after my first purchase,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Old guy , 5'10 , 230 , shaped like a beer keg , no butt to speak of (  not a pretty sight ) .  XL midrise is exactly what I needed , good fit , good support . Hanes is my go to brand . Prompt delivery , a good buy  . Update : A good fit when you first put them on ( after wash / dry ) , but elastic around thighs is too light , flimsy , stretches out in no time , next thing you know the boys are falling out . Minus two stars.",3
B00CEIU7JU,This style is no longer sold in our Walmart. Same great quality and cotton covered elastic waist band as before.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"I find that the leg holes are usually slightly too big (not an inherent problem with the briefs, just with their sizing vs my size), but not usually a problem. However, I have a few of these that fit really well, and a few that I avoid wearing because the aforementioned issue is so bad. And if you've experienced the same issue, you know why.Overall, I recommend these for their value.",4
B00CEIU7JU,na,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Advertised as moisture wicking, but 100% cotton does not wick moisture...in fact, cotton retains it...I thought I was getting a mesh cotton blend fabric, but these are just plain cotton, and I can buy these over at Wally world...kinda disappointed..",3
B00CEIU7JU,great,5
B00CEIU7JU,"I've worn this brand and style for years, and they are so comfortable. You might read some reviews that say the fabric on the newer pairs is thinner, or that they aren't made as well. I haven't found that at all. These are the same briefs as I've worn for the past 25 years, just as well-made and just as comfortable. I've already ordered another package.",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Had a hard time finding these so I just had them sent to me, they are perfect!",5
B00CEIU7JU,I am even going to be ordering more of these they are so comfy . The band is what helps with that mainly. Other than that the material love how stretchy it is. Perfect amount of stretch.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"I've been wearing this particular style of Hanes for over twenty years. I like it mostly because the enclosed waistband is super comfortable and the tag is on the outside. I'm withholding the fifth star because, over the years, I have noticed that overall quality has slid, with the waistband fraying much more quickly than they used to. My weight has been more or less constant during this period, so I do blame the product. I will continue buying as I have never found anything more comfortable.",4
B00CEIU7JU,"These are comfortable. Great fit. And they last.I think i bought my first pair 10 years ago. Still got them although they are visibly worn. I hate waistbands.These all fabric briefs do the job. Hey, I'm a regular retired guy with a little bit of a gut. So a rollover waist band or anything that cuts in is very uncomfortable.These are great. I retired and moved to the Philippines two years ago and these are even great at absorbing sweat. Trust me. Here... you sweat everywhere.These are comfortable all day. Just restocked with another 6 pairs.Keep making them guys. Great job.",5
B00CEIU7JU,Ordered these again for my husband .  He really likes the fact that the waist is covered with the fabric. He says it does not pinch like the plain elastic waistbands.,5
B00CEIU7JU,Tight underwear is like a cheap hotel. No ball room!These are extremely tight on the junk!,4
B00CEIU7JU,These are comfortable.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"If you need briefs which are coloured, this is a good option",5
B00CEIU7JU,Husband likes this style. Getting a multipack was great.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Same honest quality, been using for 20 years",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Favorite underwear. Comfortable, good quality, good price, like that the elastic is covered and there is no tag.",5
B00CEIU7JU,I think these briefs run a bit small they fit a bit snug in the waist / hip but if that's not an issue for you then ignore me!,4
B00CEIU7JU,nice,5
B00CEIU7JU,Very comfortable.  Fits as expected.,5
B00CEIU7JU,Good quality products for men clothing. Comfortable and long-lasting.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"I have an athletic build ( 6'3"" - 180lbs) and the design cut is just right. If your tired of uncomfortable underwear, try these. Provides just enough coverage everywhere to avoid becoming a thong or scrunching the jewels, while not looking like their your fathers full size ""tighty whities"". Breathable with just the right amount of stretch to conform to your body movements.",5
B00CEIU7JU,My husband like more elasticity and too loose,3
B00CEIU7JU,"Very comfortable, great fit",5
B00CEIU7JU,"Great product ,Great Seller , Flash delivery  A+A+A+ Thanks",5
B00CEIU7JU,They are comfortable,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Good , little pricey",3
B00CEIU7JU,Soft and comfortable,5
B00CEIU7JU,Excellent fit.,5
B00CEIU7JU,The briefs were exactly as described and shipped quickly.,5
B00CEIU7JU,"Hanes is a preferred brand, and the price was much better than local options.",5
B00CEIU7JU,Great quality and perfect fit! Comfortable and good coverage. Great value for the price. Love the color!,5
B00CEIU7JU,Comfortable and true to size.,4
B00CEIU7JU,I love these underwear they are quality garments and they wear well very well.,5
B00CEIU7JU,Good value for your money.,5

B00XC0GX8S,Soft and thicker than most. Very nice,5
B00XC0GX8S,"Great brand, durable for everyday use, comfort,Helps sweating keep feet dry",5
B00XC0GX8S,Very comfortable socks. They keep my feet warm.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"Even though the size states 6-12.5, I found they fit me better than most brands that are size 6-12.  I wear a mens' size 8.5 and most socks that are size 6-12 are too long and the heel portion will pull up towards the back of my ankle.  These do not.  The band is not overly tight either.  I would buy these again.*UPDATE* I liked these socks so much, I reordered them a few weeks later.  I was surprised and disappointed to have received GOLD TOE socks that were different material, fit differently (too long), had a different UPC, had gray and gold toes, not just gold color, and came from a different seller (I believe).  I returned them.",5
B00XC0GX8S,True to size and a good construction of products.,5
B00XC0GX8S,Why not have extra socks!,5
B00XC0GX8S,"These socks feel great on my feet, comfortable and feel like they will last.",4
B00XC0GX8S,I can't tell u how many times I have ordered these only to get ankle socks! So I tried one more time and bam they got it right! I have always loved gold toe!,5
B00XC0GX8S,Always the best quality from GoldToe,5
B00XC0GX8S,Exactly what expected.,5
B00XC0GX8S,Socks,5
B00XC0GX8S,Order next size up because they shrink. The socks fit great til I washed & dried them.,4
B00XC0GX8S,"These socks are great - the fit well and last a long time. As somebody who hates shopping for something as boring as socks, that's important.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I love these socks, very comfy and keep feet warm.Some people say they get holes easily, hopefully they last long enough to justify buying more if they do.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I had to go back to my favorite socks, the Gold Toe socks.  So many of the socks made today have elastic support for the arch and ankle which I find uncomfortable and more difficult to put on my feet.  I have had enough discomfort, so I purchased these Gold Toe socks and they are so comfortable and much easier to slip over my feet.",5
B00XC0GX8S,Made good,4
B00XC0GX8S,"Ordered same sox last year and really liked them.  Re-ordered same sox in November this year and they felt different, thinner and appeared slightly shorter.  Just weighed 2 pair from last year at 79 and 75 grams.  Weighed six pairs from current order and they weighed 64,64,65,67,68 grams.  They are lighter weight.  I re-ordered these because I liked the thickness for winter wear.  I will keep these because I've worn one pair but I am disappointed as the listing uses the same pictures and description, with the same model number and ASiN.  Be advised if you are re-ordering these are not the same sox from last year.",3
B00XC0GX8S,"Quality socks, just too small and tight for a Size 10.5 foot. Size range starts @ 6, would not have purchased had I had the option to try,ol or see them. Way to small.",3
B00XC0GX8S,As expected,5
B00XC0GX8S,"Have always liked GT, but not the high quality of before.  Sign of the times.  Off shore production and pricing.",4
B00XC0GX8S,Very nice and comfortable.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"Fits great (kinda loose on my 11.5 feet).  Feels kinda synthetic, but hasn't been making my feet damp, so it's good.",5
B00XC0GX8S,I have worn the Gold Toe socks for years and they wear very well.,5
B00XC0GX8S,My son has wore this socks for years and swears by them!!! I ordered my husband some and he loves them!,5
B00XC0GX8S,"Exactly what I was expecting, great quality! Will buy more in future.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"So far, they have been durable, I like how far up they sit on my legs, they're comfortable, and they stay pretty white. Don't feel cheap and I'm planning on getting 12 pairs more when I need to. I was going to gatekeep these, but I thought I might as well leave a positive review.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"This sock last, never because of holes!",5
B00XC0GX8S,"It would be nice if they were longer/higher up the calf, other wise good product",4
B00XC0GX8S,"The crew is about 1.5"" shorter than normal crew on other socks I have.  I suspect that change was made for selling to mass marketers like Amazon.  It's probably not a deal breaker for most but it sure feels strange when putting them on.  Just can't pull them high enough.  The socks feel like pretty good quality but I miss some extra padding other socks build in.  They hit an attractive price point for the consumer for a well known name.",4
B00XC0GX8S,"Great socks, just wish 1.2 were blue",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I have purchased Goldtoe socks for years.  Now, the white athletic sock material seems to be thinner and the foot opening not as wide.",4
B00XC0GX8S,I like to buy multiple pairs that look the same. These were of great quality and excellent price. They feel great and comfortable.I buy this brand all the time when I see it.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"I purchased the Men's Cotton Short Crew Athletic Socks, 6-Pairs. I now own 18-pairs. I have been wearing Gold Toe socks for over 20 years. I use to purchase them at Dillards, back in the days when I use to roam around the mall. I first purchased these exact same socks here on Amazon, a few years ago, but returned them because they looked small. Foolish me! My mistake was never trying them on first, before judging. A few months ago I placed another order (6 pack) hoping they 'fixed' the sizing issue. However, when I received the package, again.. they looked small. BUT, this time I actually put these new socks on. Now I realize that the 'issue' was me. There was never any issue with the socks. It's just that the material is now more stretchy, but in a good way, not in a bad way. Overall these socks are of even BETTER quality than the Gold Toe socks I've been purchasing for the past 20+ years.  The material is a much higher quality. The stitching is a higher quality. I expect these to last even longer than what I'm use to from Gold Toe. Plus they take up less space in the drawer. Yes, they look smaller than what we are use to, but they fit very well. I wear a size 11 shoe.I was so impressed, I threw out all my other socks and purchased two more 6 packs. Now I have 18 socks, all black.  I've grown more accustomed to the black athletic socks, they look classier IMO.",5
B00XC0GX8S,I don't waste money on other socks as I wear the toe out fast!!  These are the only way to go...can get a good 1+ years out of them wearing once a week!,5
B00XC0GX8S,They fit good and are a good quality.I have worn these for years.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"These do not stay up well throughout the day. As the day moves on, these move slowly down.",3
B00XC0GX8S,"These ""GOLDTOE Men's Cotton Blend Athletic Crew Socks, 6-Pairs"" are not the same quality as the Goldtoe socks that I buy a Dillards Department Store. These socks are thinner and have a shorter ankle. They stretch out a little by the end of the day and start sliding down my ankle. It is easy to tell that these socks will wear out in less than a year compared the socks that I buy from Dillards, which last, for me, over two years. I will not buy these again.",2
B00XC0GX8S,Every day wear. Woman with big feet. What a relief to have socks that fit.,4
B00XC0GX8S,"Always have used Gold Toe for My Athletic Shoes. Many years since I've bought. Don't know but after looking up why they are not the same noticed many other people have same problem. Shrink Flatiron they are much thinner, can see thru on crew part and parts of sock. They used to be Thick and Cushioned but not anymore. I bought the lowest price and glad I did cuz not the same. Or, Fakes..but Box Label looks real. ??? They are not bad mind you, they work just not what they used to be. Let me know if anyone out there know of a bad ass athletic sock.",3
B00XC0GX8S,"Good quality, mid-height, mostly cotton, socks.  Happy to have found these.  IMHO, worth a little more money to have the right blend of materials for longevity and proper fit.  I'll probably order more soon.  I think you'll like 'em too.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"Gold Toe needs to have model numbers or something.  Some go 3/4 up the calf like the ones I was gifted by family and some, like these, barely reach half way and slide down over time.  They are all called GoldToe Crew Socks so there's no way to tell the difference.",3
B00XC0GX8S,Wasn't long enough for my shoe size 9 1/2,5
B00XC0GX8S,"These GOLDTOE Men's Cotton Blend Athletic Crew Socks, 6-Pair pack are like the originals, before the sock making companies started making the ones to small at the top. I am pleased with the quality of this purchase, and will be buying these again.  The ones in brick and mortar stores now are no longer wide enough for the average built adults.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"Been wearing these socks for years. Highly recommend. Comfortable,  durable,  don't make my feet stink, always stay in place.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I've bought these 3 times because of the comfort,  fit and price. They were really good.....while we had carpeted floors....and then came the wooden floors. I've been throwing out roughly 3 socks a week. I check the bottoms of them in the morning and sometimes by the time I go to bed one will have a hole in it. Time to look for an alternative and/or a pair of slippers....",4
B00XC0GX8S,"I have been wearing Gold Toe socks for years, they are excellent socks, but I have screwed up my order two different times.  I ordered the crew sock with a band on top by mistake, and the band cuts off my circulation.  Unfortunately I washed them, both times, so I can't return them.  Sign...another donation to the shelter.  I really needed new socks.",5
B00XC0GX8S,I'm a 10 1/2 EE and the large size is very tight (after washing and drying).  The X-large fit perfectly.  Luckily my wife loves the large:),4
B00XC0GX8S,"For the price, these are reasonable socks. I have purchased the same product each year or so for a number of years now, 6 or 12 pairs at a time.The socks have a finite lifetime. They fail by developing holes in the bottom or heel (I am perhaps tough on socks). I would estimate any given pair lasts me for roughly 24 wearings and launderings, then it's landfill time.",4
B00XC0GX8S,They ate slightly smaller than 100% cotton but still give me enough coverage so that I don't feel uncomfortable.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"My main reason for going with a more well established brand of sock was in hopes of longevity. I want socks that will last years without getting holey. Will these socks be the ones? Im not sure, only time will tell.As far as comfort and fit goes, they feel good. About what you would expect from a sock.Appearance-wise, the ""golden toe"" part seems very small in comparison to the foot, and to be honest looks a little weird. Im not one for aesthetics, so I don't really care, but the toe print is rather ugly because of it.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I love these socks, they are by far the best so I just bought a second set of 6. Strangely enough, I noticed when doing laundry that the new socks are exactly 1"" shorter than the old ones (in the ankle area). I mean, it's fine for me, I don't care, they are long enough and are comfy and stretchy and so far they seem to last way longer than any other socks, I just felt it was my duty to point out an amusing example of ""shrinkflation"" that may be of concern to someone else looking to buy these.",5
B00XC0GX8S,The sock's durability has decreased from previous purchases.,3
B00XC0GX8S,"My husband is very happy with these socks. He says they stay up , are comfortable, have long lasting performance, and are breathable. He wants me to order another set of six pairs. Highly recommended!",5
B00XC0GX8S,"These are my favorite socks of all time, and I was so sad to see they were unavailable for a while, but now thrilled they are back!I bought these in 2018, and again in 2020. The batch from 2020 is just now starting to develop little holes in them, just in time for my new batch to take over for another 2 years. I know there are plenty of socks out there that have better durability, but in my experience, those socks are usually more expensive for just one single pair! With this one you get a whole bag of socks! Speaking of durability, I am also a very active person that works on my feet all day long, and I do all my physical activities, like tennis, basketball, and tag with the kids... all in these socks. I expect there to be holes developing after all that.My favorite part about these socks is the length though. As you can see in the pictures, these are ""short"" crew socks, and I have never seen a sock with this height before. I generally find normal crew socks to be too tall for my style, and the next standard size shorter is always too short for me. These Gold Toe ""short"" crews are exactly what I am looking for!",5
B00XC0GX8S,"When I first put on these socks, I thought the material felt thinner than black gold toe socks that I had bought in the past. Of the three pairs I have worn, one had a hole in the toe by the end of one day. They also have an odd habit of rotating during the day, with the heel often on the top of my foot by the end of the day. They are indeed black socks, you can rely on that.",2
B00XC0GX8S,I love these black gold toe socks. These socks are soft and comfortable they fit my feet as expected. These socks are a quality product that is durable for use everyday at work.,5
B00XC0GX8S,They are white socks and they fit.  Five stars.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"These crew socks were about an inch shorter than ones I've bought in the past. I was really disappointed that they were shorter and therefore NOT interchangeable with my existing collection. Otherwise, they were decent socks.",4
B00XC0GX8S,"These socks are very cozy, with an excellent fit and a form that stays put without being overly tight. I love them. These are the gold toe socks I used to buy from Macy's years ago. Then something in the supply chain led to them being flimsy replicas of the legendary Gold Toe socks they used to sell. These bring back the comfort and quality I'll pay extra to obtain.",5
B00XC0GX8S,These are good socks .,4
B00XC0GX8S,"This is it !!!  great, solves a big problem I've had. Not available in any stores in any brand. I had to write Goldtoe sock company and they responded it's available and gave this link.I can't stand shoe top socks or socks 2 inches higher than shoes. ALL the ""Crew Socks"" suddenly became 2 inches higher about 15 years ago. I have extra large calf muscles like many Skiers or Bike riders so crew socks (except this one) now do not fit.  made in Honduras. Thick 78% cotton 19% polyester 1% spandex.available in white or black. Should last many years,unlike some thin crap socks i recently had from a country in Asia (think you know the name) that didn't last even 1 year.  Thank You, Thank You Goldtoe.  !!",5
B00XC0GX8S,soft and comfy,5
B00XC0GX8S,One sock had a hole in it. This is the second time I purchased this item. First order all fine,4
B00XC0GX8S,"I liked getting a set of six socks. They are easy to wash, etc",5
B00XC0GX8S,These socks are thick but not hot. Very comfortable high quality socks.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"I love gold toe socks. I've had many pairs over the years. I thought these socks had better cushion in the foot, but it is not enough for me. After working all day in work boots, my feet, especially the tops, feel beat up.",3
B00XC0GX8S,Great fit and very comfortable. Well made.,5
B00XC0GX8S,"I have worn the Short Crew Goldtoe socks for at least 25 years since I was a kid and my mom would buy them at Marshall Field's.  I have always loved these socks.  They used to be made in the USA up until shortly after the year 2000, I think around 2004 they switched to Mexico and the quality dropped, but they were still good socks and I kept buying them (I honestly don't care where they are made, but it sucks when the quality drops when they move production to another country...why can't the quality stay the same??).  Now, fast forward to today, I ordered these socks and they are NOTHING like the Short Crew I have been wearing for over 25 years.  These new ones are LONG, like regular crew, only slightly shorter than regular crew, and they are TIGHT, hurt my feet so bad, and they are now made in Honduras (again, I have nothing against where they are made, but it sucks to see that the quality dropped so horribly when production was moved from Mexico to Honduras currently).I rarely post reviews on anything, but when a product I have loved so much has gone to heck, it saddens me and now I must find another brand, which has been difficult because most socks made today are low quality and tight, and come in only ankle length, or long crew right below knee (which is stupid).  Like I said, I have worn Goldtoe Short Crew for over 25 years religiously, and I ain't exaggerating how bad these are.  Attached are photos of my previous pair of Goldtoe Short Crew on the LEFT (made in Mexico for past 15 years) and these new versions made in Honduras on the RIGHT.  You see how much narrower and longer these new ones are, making them painful and NOT short crew as advertised.  I doubt anyone at Goldtoe cares, I doubt anyone there has worked the 25 years that I have worn these socks, so I know what I am talking about, and normally I wouldn't care and would just take my business elsewhere, but everyone has experienced this before, when a product they love and use all the time gets discontinued or drastically changed and you're like ""what the heck?  why can't these companies just leave it alone and keep it the way it has been, there was nothing wrong with it""",1
B00XC0GX8S,"Feels great, fits right and isn't made with so much plastic.",5
B00XC0GX8S,The heels developed holes after a few wearings.,2
B00XC0GX8S,"These Goldtoe socks have been a go-to item for me for ten years, maybe more.  The pack I bought online here recently are much thinner and not as long.  I'll be looking at them in a brick and mortar store to see if they are available other than Amazon, and the original construction.",3
B00XC0GX8S,"Good quality, wear well, do not stretch out of shape.",5
B00XC0GX8S,Great price for a great product.  Comfortable fit and feel.  Extra fast delivery.,5
B00XC0GX8S,After 36 years of marriage I finally found him the socks he loves. Bought two more packages ASAP!!,5
B00XC0GX8S,"I like to walk 2 to 3 miles every day depending on weather and mood. For shoes, I usually buy Brooks Addiction Walkers, which are terrific but expensive, but the last time I needed shoes I cheaped out and bought some Rockports for half the price. Big mistake.The Rockports felt like they had NO padding at all under the forefoot--like I was barefoot! To try to salvage a bad situation, I bought these Gold Toe Cushioned socks. They helped, but I failed to realize just how much until I wore some other non-padded crew socks. I thought the shoes were getting better because they were ""breaking in."" But, in fact, it was the Gold Toe socks' padding that was providing the relief. With the other socks, the Rockports were as horrible as when they were new.I've laundered the socks (Machine wash warm, tumble dry medium) 3 or 4 times. There has been no damage or shrinkage. On me, they come up to mid-calf exactly as depicted in the product photo. I take a size 11 shoe and the 6-12.5 size fits fine.They remain relatively cool and comfortable even on hot days.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I've always liked a ""short"" athletic sock, especially during the spring and summer months. Gold Toe is the only brand I've found that makes them. These are just like traditional calf length socks only a tad shorter. They are very comfortable and can be washed often without any shrinking. As I mentioned, I've been wearing these for perhaps close to 10 years now and the quality remains the same. I've never seen them made with less quality at any point. This is undoubtedly my favorite casual sock.",5
B00XC0GX8S,"I like these socks, hard to find locally",4
B00XC0GX8S,"dont buy these if you have a shoe size of 11-12.  they will be too tight and fall down when you walk. ive bought gold toe socks for 20 years and never had this problem. the old packaging used to say shoe sizes up to 13, now it says up to 12.5.",3
B00XC0GX8S,As described.,5
B00XC0GX8S,Love the feel,5
B00XC0GX8S,Fit as described and comfortable to wear,4
B00XC0GX8S,"I bought these for my husband. He is a loyal Gold Toe wearer. However, he says the length of these socks hit mid calf and slide down throughout the day, leaving him with an uncomfortable feeling. I also bought him the crew length and he says those are the best.",3
B00XC0GX8S,I love these socks. Fit beautifully. This is my second purchase. They are double the price at the local Kohls,5
B00XC0GX8S,"These are comfortable, and a very good value for the money.  I wish they came up just a tad higher, but no big deal.  They do what they're supposed to do.  I can't comment on Durability because they're new.  But based on my experience so far, they're fine.",4
B00XC0GX8S,It's a great sock.  I have been wearing them for over 70 years now.,5
B00XC0GX8S,It's been over a decade since I bought these last so I am very happy to say that they are every bit as good as they were before.  If you don't like athletic socks that go up too high on your calf then these are the right ones for you.,5
B07Q34YLTW,"These days, the price of everything is going up unfortunately. I don't remember a pack of socks being so darn expensive, even from other brands like Fruit of the Loom and Hanes - where they were generally more affordable. I was hesitant to buy these Amazon brand ones, but I figured it was a good price for how many pairs were included.I'm happy I went with this. The socks are really comfy, fit very well, and I really like the fact that they don't have any brand markings on them, they're just plain black and grey. The elasticity is good and even after a few washes, they're holding up good.I'll update if I start running into any problems, but I prefer this pick over the others, more pairs for the value of my money!",5
B07Q34YLTW,"Always bought Gold Toes in the past, but the Amazon Choice review was good, so thought I'd try these.  Quality is similar and they are comfortable to wear.  Quite pleased.  cmz",5

B07Q34YLTW,"I have been a long time user of the Golden Toe brand, but they seem to have taken a pretty significant quality hit over the years while the price has continued to go up...go figure. So it was time for a change and I chose to start with the Amazon Essentials brand. I have had mixed results with the brand with other items I have tried but at the price point it was worth a shot.Ends up I am pretty pleased so far. They are a bit thinner than the previous brand I used, but also softer. After repeated washes they seem to be holding up pretty well in the stretch department. I have also noticed even thought they appear thinner, they wear better. I was getting holes in bottom of the old brand, after walking around in the house mind you, after only a few weeks. I have yet to experience this with the Amazon Essentials brand.At this point the jury is still out, but my initial impression is these are a decent sock at a good price and I will likely be buying more again in the future.Update May 2023This is the second time I have purchased these socks with my first time being about a year and half ago now. My son also took to wearing these socks so they have gotten a lot of use and so far they have held up very well. A few socks have been tossed due to holes being worn on the bottom, but that is more due to how they are being rotated in and out of service as a few pair are still in excellent condition.  Still it got to the point with my son sharing these, that I needed to get more and I did not hesitate to purchases these same socks again. They wear well, maintain their elasticity and come at a good price. On a par or better than the old Golden Toe brand that cost twice as much.",5
B07Q34YLTW,Great socks! They are very nice and soft!,5
B07Q34YLTW,"Poor fit, twist real easy.",3
B07Q34YLTW,"These socks are pretty comfortable and worth the price. I've had them for more than six months, and I finally found a solution for a problem that I consistenly was having.When  I would put them on, there were threads on the inside of the sock that would get caught on the rough edges of my toenails. This made a real adventure out of the process of putting on the socks. What with most socks is a 10- or 15-second no-brainer was, with these socks a much more complicated procedure, as I would have to unhook the sock strands from my toenails--often multiple times.One day, as I was folding these socks after doing laundry, I happened to notice that the ""outside"" was quite smooth, i.e., no stray strands. So my Brilliant Mind said to me, ""Bill, why not turn them inside out? They probably would go on much easier, and who would be able to tell the difference."" So I listened to my Brilliant Mind and turned all these socks inside out. Voila! No more strands catching on toenails! O, thank you, Brilliant Mind!",4
B07Q34YLTW,Great socks. Part that covers the foot is thick as described. I wish the upper portion of the sock was as thick and durable as the foot portion.,4
B07Q34YLTW,"These are well made socks, and I like them for winter wear. BUT, they are very long if you pull them all the way up. For that reason, I will sure not be wearing them with shorts in warmer weather. They do seem very durable after several washings, so overall, a good purchase.....for winter.",4
B07Q34YLTW,Fit is good and comfortable,4
B07Q34YLTW,"Too long but works, im size 8 1/2. They are around 10.",5
B07Q34YLTW,Fits well and is good for the price.,4
B07Q34YLTW,I think they are to thin material wise. Ok But not great,4
B07Q34YLTW,These are better than some more expensive brands I wore through.,5
B07Q34YLTW,husband loves them,4
B07Q34YLTW,Happy with my orderWell worth buying for the price,4
B07Q34YLTW,Very comfortable,5
B07Q34YLTW,"Well made socks with a few inches above your ankle tops. Not very well padded in foot bottom. They are cheap enough, but would be better with a little more padding on foot bottom. My feet are a little tender on bottom with diabetes, but they will do for a while. Seems all socks for working wear are too tall or short up calf. These are about right for me, just not padded on foot bottom as much as I like. Tried lots of other socks to no avail.",4
B07Q34YLTW,"These socks are exactly what he wanted - medium weight, soft, and they stay put without being binding at ankle or calf.  Another wonderful bargain from Amazon Esssentials!",5
B07Q34YLTW,"I wear 10-1/2 W shoes.  I have tried at least a dozen different socks over the last couple years, looking for something comfortable.  Most socks produced today are foot stranglers, or toe stranglers, or leg stranglers.  These socks are the most comfortable I have found.  It takes a couple wash and wear cycles to find this out.  They seem a bit tight at the beginning.  And the quality of the socks is not as good as the more expensive socks.  These socks tend to develop a hole in the heel area pretty quickly.  And they become a bit loose around the leg.  But, they don't strangle my foot, and today that seems to be an amazing feat.  They are mostly cotton, another plus in my book.  So, I recommend you try them out.",4
B07Q34YLTW,The socks are nice quality. I ordered 2 packs,5
B07Q34YLTW,Just not thick enough.,4
B07Q34YLTW,"Sock extended size ""12-14"" perfectly fits my size 11 feet, ankles and below my calf.",5
B07Q34YLTW,These are too thin. I ordered 3 packs and as soon as I picked them up I knew they were going to be flimsy. Basically thin like dress socks. As always Amazon makes it easy to return.,3
B07Q34YLTW,They were perfect,5
B07Q34YLTW,"A lot of lent, was three times to remove",4
B07Q34YLTW,"These socks are about an inch higher than the average crew sock you'd wear with a boot, which is not my preference but no big deal.  The elasticity is limited, which is good as the socks stay up fine without feeling tight. Of more concern is the thickness, as these are a bit thin with minimal cushioning and do not have the expected comfort, but maybe they'll be OK for the summer.  I haven't owned them long enough to gauge their durability but am not optimistic.  I bought them because of the relatively high cotton ratio hoping for better breathability and comfort, but they're a mediocre but reasonably satisfactory option and get an extra star for the very good price.",4
B07Q34YLTW,"Tired of buying high dollar Nike socks for boy teens who get them filthy playing sports.And yes, he asked me to buy him more like these.",4
B07Q34YLTW,Great Product,5
B07Q34YLTW,Muy buena calidad,4
B07Q34YLTW,"Soft. Form fitting. Breathe well. Cushioned soul. Maintained softness, form-fitting and breathability after several washes (without bleach). Very good socks, I will buy more, and more.",5
B07Q34YLTW,I tried these socks out and found that they are a bit too tight. They leave marks on my legs that take a few hours to go away after I remove the socks. I am giving these socks to charity and re-ordering the socks that I have been using for the last 10-15 years.,3
B07Q34YLTW,It got holes within weeks,3
B07Q34YLTW,I've had these for a few months now and they haven't ripped shrunk or got slack on the elastic. Been thru a few wash cycles and didn't lint up. So far so good,5
B07Q34YLTW,Good price but I was looking for a better quality.,3
B07Q34YLTW,My swollen legs (below my calf) are 12 inches around. Socks were too tight around leg and left an indentation mark. I gave the socks away to someone with smaller legs. Quality of socks are excellent though.,4
B07Q34YLTW,Comfortable nice fitting socks.  I bought them 3.5 months ago and I've had 2 pair of 10 develop holes in the washer.,3
B07Q34YLTW,"As said , nice  crew sock for the price, but was too tight around the lower calf and the poly blend was unforgiving with no ability to stretch. Perfect for those with slender ankles and calves.",4
B07Q34YLTW,"Good socks, well worth the money, but only 8 pairs were in the ""10 pair"" package. What the hell, Amazon?",3
B07Q34YLTW,"These socks will do in a pinch. They are relatively inexpensive, and the reason for that will be apparent when you put them on and they snag on your toenails. As with most cheap socks, these socks have crude stitching inside and seem to wear out fairly quickly. In the future, I'll spend a little more for some quality name brand socks. As they say, ""you get what you pay for"", and that is certainly true with these particular socks.",3
B07Q34YLTW,"Good quality, good deal.",5
B07Q34YLTW,"This is a regular order in our household in both black and white socks.  They are great soft quality, stay bunched up where he wants them, breathable and lightweight.  Great value for the money and plan to buy more in the future.",5
B07Q34YLTW,Soft and not to thick. Great price,5
B07Q34YLTW,Use for the times when I know longer wear shorts.,5
B07Q34YLTW,you know how your 70-year-old dad wear his undies and socks until they are tattered rags? buy these for your dad for Christmas! they never buy themselves socks or undies!!!!,5
B07Q34YLTW,These socks are good for wearing with work boots.,4
B07Q34YLTW,"I wear a mens' size 8.5 and most mens' socks are 6-12.  The heel would always go up towards my ankle because they were too long for me.  Same with these.  I wanted to like them because they were so soft, but ended up returning them due to the length.",4
B07Q34YLTW,Comfortable fit,5
B07Q34YLTW,Fit nice and feel comfortable.,5
B07Q34YLTW,I bought this product years ago and loved the socks. I thought when I bought the same item again they would be the same. I was really disappointed when I got them. They were much cheaper than my original order. They are much thinner with not as much cushion.,3
B07Q34YLTW,"Amazon does a great job of picking out their ""essentials"" products",5
B07Q34YLTW,Great socks,5
B07Q34YLTW,nice,5
B07Q34YLTW,These seem like they will last,5
B07Q34YLTW,"Price,and fit. Socks don't roll down your calf",5
B07Q34YLTW,"Great value for the price.  They're lightweight, breathable and soft, but they're too tight on the lower calf.  You won't find better in that price range.",4
B07Q34YLTW,Theses socks are great for working in and comfortable!,5
B07Q34YLTW,Absorbs sweat better during heavy work days,5
B07Q34YLTW,The material is thicker than expected.But a loose fit for my 10-1/2 feet.,4
B07Q34YLTW,This seems to be a good product.  CMK. 7/6/24,4
B07Q34YLTW,A great product at a great price.,5
B07Q34YLTW,"My shoe size is 12-1/2 and these socks without stretch can easily fit a size 15. The heal portion is grey in color, this sits on the upper portion my Achilles if I pull the sock to where it's snug on my foot. I guess by positioning it where the heal mates up to mine, this adds more cushion to the foot portion.As for being crew socks, they're closer to being tube socks. I have to fold the calf portion in half just so they set just below my calf. Otherwise, they're closer to the back of my knee.It appears that the sizing isn't consistent, because I went with the 12-14 size based on other reviews stating the socks were too small.I decided to keep them for their value. I know next time to pick the size down.",4
B07Q34YLTW,will buy again,4
B07Q34YLTW,This quality of the socks are amazing and the size is just as good . I am well pleased with this product.,5
B07Q34YLTW,"Hard to find cotton socks these days and the others make my fee stink. I use these for yard work. They are 70% cotton, feel pretty good but are a bit thinner than I'd like.  They fit fine for my 11 -11 1/2W shoe size . All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.",4
B07Q34YLTW,"Muy buena la calidad y el color, gruesas, perfectas para usar con botas",5
B07Q34YLTW,poca calidad me quedaron grandes,4
B07Q34YLTW,Very comfortable!,5
B07Q34YLTW,"I have gout.  The trend in socks lately seems to be to put a a tight band that squeezes the middle  of your foot.  I hate that, so much more gout pain!  These are normal socks.  Thats all I want.  They're a bit thick for my taste, but I don't mind.  Adds a bit of cushion.",5
B07Q34YLTW,Great socks for work.  I plan to buy more in the future and to donate to homeless shelters who are always asking for things like socks and other personal items.,5
B07Q34YLTW,They fit great. But they bleed black dye and tons of fuzzies.Wash & dry these inside out.Wash only with dark colors.,3
B07Q34YLTW,Good quality and very comfortable. I bought an extra pack. These are my favorite socks. My brother bought a few packs as well.,5
B07Q34YLTW,"Very, very soft. It's kind of shocking how soft they are. They're thick, but not so thick that they're suffocating or make you sweat. Overall really good. I'll have to wear them for a while to see how durable they are, so I won't rate on that metric yet.",5
B07Q34YLTW,Works,5
B07Q34YLTW,Title said it all,5
B07Q34YLTW,As advertised. Teenager said they were good socks,5
B07Q34YLTW,"After wearing these for several days now I've noticed that there is not a sufficient amount of cotton content for me to avoid the inevitable irritation due to sensitivity to synthetic contents in these socks. I'm ordering 100% cotton socks from now on as 75% is not enough to avoid a hot burning sensitivity at the end of the day. Otherwise, it's normal socks with no issues.",3
B07Q34YLTW,"I gave up on socks from a major manufacturer, as the quality was getting low and the price was getting high. These Amazon socks are very nice!I should have tried them earlier! They are very comfortable. Cushioning feels great!",5
B07Q34YLTW,My husband likes these. They have held up very well. Will buy again.,5
B07Q34YLTW,"The socks are comfortable and warm but the first thing I noticed was that the outside have clumps of fiber that could just pull off or fall of with use. As I wore them around the house, I certainly did notice black fuzz all over my carpet. Not sure if this was a bad batch or a common thing. Perhaps this would not be an issue for those people that always wear shoes, but I do not wear shoes in my home.",3
B07Q34YLTW,"I have bought these socks for my son twice now. He has very sensitive feet and it's so hard to find socks that are mostly cotton, at a reasonable price. I think the heels could be a little more reinforced but overall great quality. Dog enjoys eating them as well.",4
B07Q34YLTW,"So far, so good! These new threads are slimmer but oh-so-soft compared to my old faithfuls. Despite numerous spin cycles, they're proving to be quite the elastic warriors. What's more, they seem to be outlasting their chunkier predecessors. The old ones? Holes galore after a mere stroll around the house! These Amazon Essentials? Still going strong, hole-free.",5
B07Q34YLTW,"These socks, in white, replaced socks that were heavy and did not stand up to my normal use.  I ordered them because of the cotton content and the price was right. I have worn each pair 5 times and washed/dried then as directed, Cold and low heat. They are very comfortable with shoes and are comfortable without shoes. They do not shrink unlike the $7 socks they replaced. I highly recommend these socks. Be sure to wash and dry as recommended by the manufacturer.  It is now about 6 months later. The socks are still holding up (as they should) some time ago the white balls of cotton have showed up but less than when it started. I ordered 30 pairs over 3 weeks or so. Each pair has been washed according to the directions 3 more times. Except for the pilling the socks are still holding up and for $2 socks they are great. I hope they hold up a long time. I still highly recommend these socks.",5
B07Q34YLTW,These socks are thick good quality and sturdy.,5
B07Q34YLTW,"These socks are perhaps the most comfortable dress socks that I have ever worn. The others I've purchased, although the correct size, are too tight, and make my lower legs feel uncomfortable after wearing them all day.",5
B07Q34YLTW,fairly easy to get on over the toe nails and hammer toes,4
B07Q34YLTW,Fits the cause,5
B0874WD2B2,"I like that they offer a range of colors. Some schools have a code for what color compression shirts your kid can wear. My son says it's true to size, comfortable, & looks good!",5
B0874WD2B2,"Got this for my boyfriend who plays football and boxes. He loves wearing it to practice, has a snug fit, light weight, stays in place, and is a better price than getting it from a sports store.",5
B0874WD2B2,Got this to wear under hockey equipment. Keeps me cool and dry! Runs a little on the small side but otherwise its great!,5
B0874WD2B2,"Great to workout in, not uncomfortable to sweat in, not only for guys i wear a small. Good material",5
B0874WD2B2,"Been trying to get this one girl forever but she has a bf, I put this black compression on with some grey sweatpants and she said it looked so good on me I could get some and that is what I did. I shot even with someone on defense and I made it. This shirt is amazing just make sure you have some grey baggier sweat pants with it.",5
B0874WD2B2,I am at 247 lbs and I got a XL size. I do have some muscle but I got it to wear to help with keeping loose skin together. I'll be making homemade body butter and I'm hoping soon the skin will help heal good along with wearing this too. I would recommend this as a under shirt because to me it is a little see thru though at least on me.,5
B0874WD2B2,perfect fit,5
B0874WD2B2,Excelente experiencia.,5
B0874WD2B2,UA is just the best i just copped all the colors,5
B0874WD2B2,Fit perfectly and I wore this under my jersey.,5
B0874WD2B2,Arrived fast. And my needs are fulfilled.,5
B0874WD2B2,Perfect fit for my son no complaints,5
B0874WD2B2,fit as chart says and received fast,5
B0874WD2B2,"compre en blanco, rojo y negro.",5
B0874WD2B2,Great,5
B0874WD2B2,Nice,4
B0874WD2B2,I like,5
B0874WD2B2,Materiales buenos,5
B0874WD2B2,"Fits well, stretchy, good color.",4
B0874WD2B2,"I love UA as a brand, i'm fanatic and biased. Super unfair for me to review this. But I love their line of compression and heat gear",5
B0874WD2B2,Great quality but runs very small,3
B0874WD2B2,Loved it!,5
B0874WD2B2,My bf loved it,5
B0874WD2B2,These compression tshirts fit and feel so comfortable. Great quality!,5
B0874WD2B2,Have a torn abdominal muscle and the compression helps keep the muscle from moving too much. The shirt fits perfectly and is easier to get off than other brands I've used due to the moisture wicking ability.,5
B0874WD2B2,"Size, quality, stretchiness & breathable",5
B0874WD2B2,"Buying this shirt was a no-brainer for me. It fits very well, tight and compressed, and I enjoy wearing this shirt. I will say, wash it before wearing. I put it on right out of the package just to see if it fit (in case if I needed to exchange for another size). It wasn't as soft as I was expecting, but one wash and it felt just like a compression shirt should.",5
B0874WD2B2,"I got the XL at 5'11"" (with a long torso), 180#, and am reasonably fit. The fit is good. The only gripe I've got with these is the seams are very pronounced and rough. Especially the ones that run in the arm pit. I use these for BJJ, and they're holding up so far.",4
B0874WD2B2,I ordered this for my son. He is slim and it fit him nicely. He loves it. Will order again in other colors.,5
B0874WD2B2,Nice fit,5
B0874WD2B2,I thoroughly enjoy Under Armor compression gear.  Great quality ant fit.  I use these shirts for weightlifting and it helps my shoulder.,5
B0874WD2B2,Very nice make sure to size down a couple if you didn't know looks nice is stretchy and perfect for sports,5
B0874WD2B2,Great under a long sleeve running shirt when it is cold.,5
B0874WD2B2,Love these shirts for running & biking in hot weather.  Keeps me aerodynamic!  :),5
B0874WD2B2,They are exactly what I wanted.,5
B0874WD2B2,I wear these on hot days and it keeps me cooler than cotton t-shirts.  They are really high quality shirts.,5
B0874WD2B2,Everything is great!,5
B0874WD2B2,"I've had this Underarmor shirt for about 6 months now. Before this I've been using a volcom surf rash guard as an extra layer for either warmth or to wick sweat while working out. It was especially comfortable as it compressed just enough to feel like a second skin.The underarmor shirt is like that except a even better. There are several extra seams, more so than a normal shirt cut, which help guide the compression in just the right place and even prevent it from riding up.I've tried other compressions shirts even a Nike one, but they all were more of a looser fit, which isn't what I wanted. Since I got this UA shirt I've worn it almost every day for working out and otherwise, it gets washed all the time so I can keep wearing it. Definitely getting more of these.",5
B0874WD2B2,Linda playera buena calidad se puede lavar a mano o en maquina.,4
B0874WD2B2,si buscas una camisa de compresion esta es excelente la compre para jugar basket recomendada,5
B0874WD2B2,Intact,5
B0874WD2B2,Love this shirt. I wear it as an undershirt and it's very comfortable. It's made with same great Under Armour quality I've come to know and love over the years. It fits amazing and the fabric breathes very well for when you're out in the heat. 10/10 recommend!,5
B0874WD2B2,"I use this as an undershirt for my work uniform in these warmer days. It's meant to be close to your body to expel heat and feels much better than a cotton under shirt. The material feels durable and easy to wash/dry for quick wash cycles between work schedules. I have since ordered multiple for rotation. I am 6'1"" 185lbs normal athletic build and I felt the XXL to be most comfortable for me",5
B0874WD2B2,There's nothing I disliked about the UA shirt it fits perfect the sweat wicking is satisfying and I stay cool all day I recommend these undershirts for everyday use.,5
B0874WD2B2,My hubby wears these under his workout shirt at the gym and he really likes them. Great fit too!,5
B0874WD2B2,no complaints,5
B0874WD2B2,Great price shipping good quality,5
B0874WD2B2,Na,5
B0874WD2B2,Product fit well and I wear it a lot,4
B0874WD2B2,Brought it for my high school football player fits great!,5
B0874WD2B2,Defiantly helps keep you cooler on these hot days I can't believe I haven't tried them before now,5
B0874WD2B2,Exactly what I'd expect from Underarmor,5
B0874WD2B2,"I liked the shirt. The material is a bit on the thin, but it is from the Heat Gear line.  The fit is exactly as expected.  However, I wonder why some colors are more expensive than other colors?  I plan to order 1-2 more.",5
B0874WD2B2,"Need motivation to keep working out?  Buy these shirts.  The shame of your fat rolls being mercilessly displayed to the rest of the world will force you to run harder, lift more, and generally push yourself further than you normally would.  Because if you don't, you look like a damn wearing saran wrap.  On the upside, when you eventually fit into them, it's a great feeling (I'm still chubby in the above picture.  Not there yet.)  Shown in the image are exercise shorts from G Gradual, which is a great product as well.  One thing to be careful of is that any snag on the fabric... and I mean ANY snag... will pull threads out and make the shirt look like trash.  So don't lean over chain link fences like I did to pet a dog during your daily run.",5
B0874WD2B2,"This shirt is comfortable and good quality. It fits as expected and good for warm weather. May be more pricy than others available, but consistent with value for UA products. appearance is as advertised and lightweight but durable.",5
B0874WD2B2,"Due to this being a compression shirt, it works great as an undershirt for dress clothes, as it does not allow wrinkles to form, making the overshirt look much nicer.",5
B0874WD2B2,My son has had this shirt for a couple years now and really enjoys it thank you,4
B0874WD2B2,"Nice materials and fit!! Too many seams around arms & shoulders!! Some pucker in different places on shoulders!!! Necks are also too big, I like the neck a little tighter!!! Bottom part s is good",3
B0874WD2B2,"Low the sizing, color and fit!",5
B0874WD2B2,These are great for playing sports. They have the extra part in the back with small tiny breathable holes in the bottom middle of the back of the shirt.Highly recommend these to athletes,5
B0874WD2B2,Probably one of the best compression shirts made of not the best. We put these through the torture chambers with football/soccer/wrestling and they are still intact and comfortable,5
B0874WD2B2,These have the same excellent compression as my Coldgear mocks. The sleeves are medium length notably. If you want shorter sleeves but less midriff compression go for UA's Tactical version of this shirt. Owning both helps me make this comparison.,5
B0874WD2B2,My son loves these shirts! I do think that the cost is too much but he's happy with them. The look and feel nice as well.,5
B0874WD2B2,I know it is a compression T-Shirt but I can barely breathe!,4
B0874WD2B2,I like the breathable and the performance,5
B0874WD2B2,Good quality,5
B0874WD2B2,Bought it for a gift. The person loved it,4
B0874WD2B2,He loves the feel of it better than his previous compression shirts. The test will be how it holds up in the laundry.,5
B0874WD2B2,As always under armour is comfortable and true to size!,4
B0874WD2B2,These are the best shirts for activities like hot yoga with a lot of sweating,5
B0874WD2B2,Shirt fits well,4
B0874WD2B2,Good fit! My son loved it!,5
B0874WD2B2,Thank you,5
B0874WD2B2,"I bought this shirt to play basketball in, and as an athlete, this shirt is very comfortable and lightweight. It fits very well and is good quality. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the sleeves are longer than I like, but that is more of a personal preference than something wrong with the shirt.",5
B0874WD2B2,I've been a UA fan for decades because of the quality.  This was my first purchase in years and I have to say that the quality of material is much thinner than years past...but the price continues to rise...maybe time for a new brand of compression tees.,3
B0874WD2B2,Sizing seems off I needed a large and its super tight in a good way but the medium (which I normally wear) was suffocatingly tight the large were perfect,5
B0874WD2B2,"It did as it was advertised just wished it the price was a bit lower. Comfort is good, this shirt is for people that want to show off their hard work in the gym.",4
B0874WD2B2,"Let's start with the positive aspects. The stretchiness of this running shirt is truly impressive. It provides an excellent range of motion, allowing for unrestricted movement during physical activities. Whether I was sprinting, stretching, or engaging in high-intensity workouts, the shirt accommodated my movements comfortably without any constriction.However, the one drawback I experienced was the tendency of the shirt to creep up while running. Due to its stretchiness, it would ride up above my waistline during running and require adjustment.",4
B0874WD2B2,"This shirt feels very comfortable and does not get sweaty at all, at least for me. It dries quickly and makes me feels bigger and the pump is better too. It may all be in my head but I rather wear this than a tank top.",5
B0874WD2B2,cumple su objetivo de apretar pero les recomienndo compren una mas alta.,5
B0874WD2B2,Under Armour honestly never disappoints,5
B09NMPG7NP,"These are great t-shirts, extremely well made and should last for years. They fit just right and wash up nicely!",5
B09NMPG7NP,These are high quality tshirts and the extra length keeps them tucked in. They wash up nice and are super soft.,5
B09NMPG7NP,"These things fit excellent until they shrunk after the first wash.  I have a tall torso which is a pain to find clothes to fit.  Ok, but definitely not perfect.",4
B09NMPG7NP,"Husband is picky about softness- he liked the feeling of these out of the bag and through a wash. Bought the Tall 2x knowing they would be a bit too big and shrink (I expect cotton to shrink). Too big to me means it looks sloppy and too large when untucked. As I suspected, washing and drying left it the perfect size, now it looks casual or comfortable when untucked- no longer sloppy.  I assume those who buy cotton know it shrinks and expands easily, so you buy according to your preferred look. I would buy these again.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"Some of the shirts I got, the right sleeve is shorter than the left and the right has a tendency to roll up for no reason.",3
B09NMPG7NP,Good value for many,5
B09NMPG7NP,Hanes sizing is bigger than expected but acceptable for me,4
B09NMPG7NP,"I ordered three XL Tall T-shirts in grey. Good T-Shirts yet one of them came in regular length and not tall. It was even labeled tall. I don't know how that can happen. I should have compared them before I washed all of them before wear.Make sure you check and compare your shirts when you receive them.Other than the strange size difference, they are good shirts.",4
B09NMPG7NP,ok,5
B09NMPG7NP,Loved them. I'm long waisted and these cover my belly. .,5
B09NMPG7NP,"Hanes has always been a good quality product, they do not shrink with repeat washing",4
B09NMPG7NP,"These shirts are super comfortable. They are very, very soft and stay tucked in thanks to the extra length.",5
B09NMPG7NP,Great quality and fit real nice,5
B09NMPG7NP,Perfect as expected.,5
B09NMPG7NP,"Recommend.  Soft breathable cotton, fits and fabric suitable for layering",5
B09NMPG7NP,Great price. Exactly what I ordered,5
B09NMPG7NP,"I wear these under my work polos and had trouble in the past with the length, the shirts coming untucked often.  I am a bigger guy and this was very inconvenient.  These shirts (XT) are a little longer and stay tucked with no problems.  They are also extremely soft and comfortable, with no tag to irritate your neck.  I would recommend these for anyone who need a tuckable and good quality T-Shirt/Undershirt",5
B09NMPG7NP,"I purchased two packs of these because they said they were 5xl Tall. When I received them I tried one on and compaired it to another brand I just purchased 5 days before. These were expensive compared to the other brand. These are $45.00 a pack of 5. The other brand ( also a well know brand) where the same size as these 5 XL ,  but they were not marked tall, they were also much more affordable than the Hanes,  at 6 shirts for $30.00 thats $5.00 a shirt.  These Hanes cost $7.50  a shirt  and are no longer than the other know well known brand.  I will stick with the fruity brand.",4
B09NMPG7NP,The shirts are a great product to buy and a great feeling material,5
B09NMPG7NP,Nicely made.  I bought these because they were offered in tall sizes.  The extra length is great,4
B09NMPG7NP,"I bought like 9 of these Tall 2XL t-shirts because I'm tall and wanted undershirts to go under my business casual and business formal dress clothes that I wear to work and related conferences or other work functions. They do their job, absorbing moisture and providing a nice tall fit. I generally tuck these in and then leave my other shirt untucked.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"We just keep buying more of these.  (My husband likes them too.)  For me, perfect 'nightgown' on a hot night:  I buy them big, & they extend down to mid-thigh.  Also, great as a [cheap] 'beach coverup' to minimize sunburn.",5
B09NMPG7NP,Very happy with the t shirts...they fit my husband very well.  Also...they came exactly as promised...thank you to amazon customer service...,5
B09NMPG7NP,Great fit. Very comfortable.,5
B09NMPG7NP,Good buy but totally see through. I wear them to bed as sleep shirts,4
B09NMPG7NP,"Woooooo doggie! Ain't it great to sport a t-shirt that covers my belly and doesn't show my 12 pack from hanging over my belt. Ya baby, butt crack doesn't show either, and at my age, that helps everyone out. Best feature of all, tagless. I want to marry the person who invented tagless. I mean, no walking around with your arm twisted behind your back scratching because of the tag. I tore a rotator cuff doing that when I was young.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"My son wears a 4XLT so I ordered these Hanes 4XLT and a couple Champion 4XLT t-shirts.  The Champion brand t-shirts fit perfect and were long enough, excellent quality.  These Hanes were a softer cotton and the 4XL part fit, but they were not long enough for the Tall part.  They were too short, much shorter than the Champion brand. I am returning them as they are not even long enough to be tucked in or cover my son's waistline or belt.  He liked the softness of the cotton and the fact they're tagless, but they don't fit. I do not recommend these for anyone needing a Tall size.",2
B09NMPG7NP,"The shirts look good in the package but they are quite thin and flimsy.  I am 5'10"" 270 lbs I ordered the 4xt which turns out to be too large for me.",3
B09NMPG7NP,I ordered these to wear under my shop uniform they stay tucked in all day no problem. I like the slightly longer length compared to store bought 2xl.,5
B09NMPG7NP,"These are fine and fit great, but 1 shirt came with a hole near the collar. If it wasn't in the back and this wasn't just an undershirt it would have been a problem.",4
B09NMPG7NP,"They say that 70% of men over 55 (me, as one) are overweight. There's little we can do. Ordinary t-shirts, even the so-called ""extra large"" or 2x, 3x, etc. ride higher with each wash. These shirts when they're new go down about 8"" below my waist--perfect for hiding the belly that you don't want people seeing. Even after washing, there is enough LENGTH on these shirts so that I can tool around all day in public without constantly pulling my shirt down.  LOSE WEIGHT! they say. Yeah, yeah, heard all that before, does no good. I want to live my life in comfort, not skipping meals or losing weight to make others happy. I'm happy the way I am, and yes, I'm overweight but I'm in fair shape and I need products like these to cover up those things that need to be hidden.  $30 for three--yes they are long enough so when you put your hands over your head, you're still covered all the way down. My plan is to replace all my old T-shirts with these, one pack every three weeks until they're ALL long. I have a 56"" chest and a 42"" waist, and the 2XL fit so comfortably. The 3x might be a big baggy. The good news is, I don't plan on going up to a 3x, so if you have about the same measurements (honest measurements) then the 2XL tall is a great t-shirt. I have no illusions that an XL regular will do the job, so you can have confidence in this product. Shrinking is minimal if you use cold or warm water, (NOT HOT!), to wash. Good luck.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"I ordered the Hanes men's t-shirt for a family member.  He loved the quality of the t-shirts that, unlike some he recently bought and laundered for the first time, did not hold their shape especially around the neck.  He'll soon be purchasing more of the same.On a side note, the t-shirts were delivered without any type of Amazon packing.  The deliveryman saw me standing outside and handed the t-shirts to me.  It was as if I had picked them up off a shelf in the store.  This is not a good look for Amazon as I don't like the idea of neighbors seeing personal products that I order.  Not very professional at all.",5
B09NMPG7NP,But I love the quality and feel. I'm 6'8 320lbs and the 4xt fits perfectly. No big neck and good length. Praying when I wash them they don't shrink. Will be ordering more regardless.,5
B09NMPG7NP,I have ordered these shirts on 4 different occasions in order to get the actual shirts shown. The first order was correct and I liked them so much I tried to reorder them from the exact same link. They sent me two more orders with each one being a completely different shirt before finally getting the third reorder correct,2
B09NMPG7NP,These actually have tags.,5
B09NMPG7NP,Great material and size,5
B09NMPG7NP,"Comfortable, good material. They do shrink if you do laundry like I do which is basically just cram everything in to the washer and use the normal cycle but really no complaints.",5
B09NMPG7NP,Good quality,4
B09NMPG7NP,Comfortable and useful for craft project.,5
B09NMPG7NP,"These shirts are long for tall people and stay tucked in.  They are thinner material, but they are undershirts.  I would buy them again and it is hard to find tall black undershirts,",4
B09NMPG7NP,Delivered to  wrong  house.  Black  spot on collar of one of the shirts.,3
B09NMPG7NP,Overall good shirts. Wish they came in a true XLT. The y seems to shorten after the first wash.  I may buy again unless I can find a true XLT under shirt.,4
B09NMPG7NP,Fabric is soft. Seems to always have a static charge which attracts dust and cat hair.Much larger than any other XL t shirt I've bought,4
B09NMPG7NP,Nothing,5
B09NMPG7NP,These are exactly the shirts I need for my height and happy to find them. However there was one shirt that had a row of holes across the right side front of the shirt.  There was no plastic line holding the shirts together or connecting the shirts in any way so I have no idea how those would have gotten there.,2
B09NMPG7NP,"Bought this in gray and black for my husband, he wears the gray right now because of the warm temperatures. The T-shirts have held up very well through numerous washings, they have not shrunk, they are true to size. And they are also a very flattering T-shirt the way they are cut.",5
B09NMPG7NP,They are SUPER soft and Very comfortable! Hubs can't get out of em!,5
B09NMPG7NP,"The shirts were great quality. But ordered 2XL Tall and 2 of the shirts where not tall so can not wear, to short. All in same package.",2
B09NMPG7NP,"Soft, correct size, and comfortable, perfect lounge wear",5
B09NMPG7NP,"I bought Tall. After one washing and drying on medium heat these shrunk so much they wouldn't stay tucked. Worthless to me. Also, they appear to be a blend, not 100% cotton.",2
B09NMPG7NP,Fit great. Look good,5
B09NMPG7NP,The tall shirts work real good,5
B09NMPG7NP,Very nice and soft and good for sleeping and everyday wear. Thicker and not thin and great necks and sleeve length like the classics used to be. Hope my review helps you?,5
B09NMPG7NP,"I compared them to the store bought ones with the red label. The black label ones came from Amazon. There is definitely a fabric difference in favor of the store bought shirts. They've both been washed in cold water and very low heat. My dryer has air, very low, low, medium, and high heat. The black label also shrunk about 3"". I recommend just buying your shirts from the store and look for the red label.",3
B09NMPG7NP,Fits as to be expected. Super soft and comfortable months after purchase and wearing everyday at work. Will buy again!,5
B09NMPG7NP,The tee shirts fit well and are comfortable but the material is very thin and some shirts in the pack already had holes and loose seam straight out of the package. Would look for shirts of better quality in the future.,3
B09NMPG7NP,"These are very nice shirts, but the size runs large and sags at the neck a little",4
B09NMPG7NP,"Overall, I like these. I am pleased with how long the tall sizes are. I wish they were a bit thicker material that will not wear out so fast.",4
B09NMPG7NP,The material the shirt's are made of is very thin .,4
B09NMPG7NP,"The disappearing undershirt.  I own 3 generations of Hanes undershirts. Latest are made in India and thin, almost see-thru, the older Hanes undershirts were made in Haiti.  The kitchen scales don't lie:  recent Hanes with Tall fit weighs in at 5oz/145gramd.  The older Hanes are regular length so 10% shorter yet the few year old Hanes made in Haiti (red labeling) weighs 5.4oz/153gms and my ten year old Hanes (from the bottom of the cupboard with red/black labeling) weighs 6oz/170 grams.  Quality is going one way.",3
B09NMPG7NP,cold weather friend!,5
B09NMPG7NP,My husband wears these under his scrubs. They are awesome.,5
B09NMPG7NP,Impressed with quality of shirts.  Well made and soft yet sturdy fabric.,5
B09NMPG7NP,I really like the fit of Hanes t-shirts better than most others and getting the tall is perfect since I have the height and also a belly. Everything is covered.,5
B09NMPG7NP,The fabric is so thick and heavy that it is uncomfortable at first. Hate to see what it would feel like if it got soaked in the rain.,3
B09NMPG7NP,"I'm a tall man with average legs and a longer torso. Therefore, I have to purchase ""tall"" undershirts or else they pull out at the waist. These ""tall"" undershirts were fine out of the package. After a couple of washes, they no longer tuck in. That's right, not only do they come untucked, some of them are literally too short to tuck in. I think they just take regular shirts, stretch them and package them as ""tall."" It's like they don't use more fabric, just stretch them. Literally worthless to me after two washes. Well, maybe not worthless. I guess I can use them to clean up after the dog.",1
B09NMPG7NP,"All's well, i'm happy, and life is good!!!",5
B09NMPG7NP,"I liked the weight of these undershirts, however, the neck opening is oversized and oval. I will be returning these",3
B09NMPG7NP,The quality could be better but these are definitely serviceable.,4
B09NMPG7NP,"Very thin material. Might be right for some guys, but I prefer a thicker undershirt.",3
B09NMPG7NP,"I love Hanes products. I have a big and tall nephew who is 21. These 5x Tee Shirts are very well made, soft and the length is GREAT for the height of my nephew. I am pleased and he is too. I would suggest these for the Big and Tall man in your life.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"Pros:Great quality of fabric. The crew neck is a comfortable snug fit with a cuffed style hem so it looks great around the neck. The 5xlt is roomie in the body.Cons. I order a 5xlt as in tall. There is no marking on the shirt or packaging that gives a size. The length is 1.5 to 2 inches shorter than all my other 5xlt t-shirts. This is a major issue for me, reason for only three stars.These shirts would be perfect if the length was truly a tall. I am going to reach out to the seller to confirm I received tall sizes. I will update this review when I get a response.",3
B09NMPG7NP,"This not a heavy t-shirt, meaning is more summer t-shirt, fabric on the thin side. I'm 6'2' over 300lbs. have good room to move around. Cut is good and comfortable. I will wait to see if I have reaction to fabric. I break out in armpit if to much polyester. Will edit if I do.",4
B09NMPG7NP,"These are a great undershirt for my husband. They are thin, soft, and comfortable.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"Like how they fit and feel, have several of them now.  Will buy again!",5
B09NMPG7NP,Perfect fit. I'm usually stretching my shirts so theybare longer but these are perfect!!,5
B09NMPG7NP,The necks get very loose and the material stretches out east,3
B09NMPG7NP,"It was time for some new tees since mine were getting a bit stained and had some holes.  These tees are no nonsense,  They are long enough to tuck in but ok wearing out.  They work as a pj top, too.  I also like to wear them in the winter under sweaters.  Not having a tag is also a plus.",5
B09NMPG7NP,"Love the quality of this tshirt, feels great! But unfortunately they do not shrink in length the way Tshirts usually do, so my husband now has mini dresses ;)",5
B09NMPG7NP,Great fit!!! Will buy again!,5
B09NMPG7NP,"Okay, maybe I should say that they are incredible shirts but I use them as undershirts.Perks:- No tags- They don't shrink in the wash- They stay tucked in- Thin enough to not make you sweat when you are activeCons:I haven't found any yet.",5
B09NMPG7NP,Fits ok until washed.,3
B09NMPG7NP,"Very soft and comfy fabric. I got them for my husband to wear under his dress shirts to church. He's 6'6 and finding tall shirts that are long enough to tuck in is a challenge. He wants more to wear to work (fabricator welder) under his work provided button shirt. They are 100% cotton so I hang dry them, but I do that with most all our shirts.",5
B09NMPG7NP,The shirts were perfect and the item came on time,5
B08YGTLS7P,"The weather in my city can be quite variable throughout the day, so I needed an extra layer to keep me comfortable when the temperature drops. This jacket is the perfect daily companion - it has a minimalist, casual style that looks great and is comfortable to wear over a shirt or t-shirt. The fit is just right, not too baggy. There were a few minor issues with loose threads, but nothing that couldn't be easily trimmed. Overall, this is a great everyday jacket that helps me adapt to the changing weather.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"I really like this hoodie -- it is comfortable, breathable, fits well, and keeps me warm in cool weather.  The zipper works well -- I have not experienced any jammed zippers since wearing this hoodie for several months.However, this hoodie is too thin to wear alone in colder temperatures (say, lower than the low 60F's), but makes a great additional layer of clothing because of its relative thinness. Wearing it along with a jacket likely will keep you warm, depending on your tolerance for cold weather.  The strings that fasten the hood to the face tend to disappear beyond the hood's eyelets, making it at times, difficult to pull out to tie around your neck again.Perhaps the biggest complaint I have about this piece of clothing is that the color fades relatively quickly.  After a few months, as you can see from the photos, the color starts to fade -- yet the jacket will still keep you warm.If you can get past the minor inconveniences, then this hoodie is a great buy and great value.",4
B08YGTLS7P,I wanted to buy a nice lightweight jacket and I definitely found one! It's lightweight but not super light so it still keeps you warm and its not the type of jacket that leave your shirts with a lot of lint definitely worth the buy for $10!,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Super soft and cozy but they're also a little longer, of course. Roomier. And the pockets are deeper! They're huge! Now we know.Very comfortable and a great deal for such a high-quality product.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"Ordered XL was too big.  Easy return and refund.  Reordered LG and it fits perfect.  I am a 5'5"" male 160#.  The inside material is soft and comfortable.  The outside material is soft and nice looking.  The best part is that it is warm and not bulky.  I would differently buy this hoodie again.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"Hanes vs. Fruit of the Loom comparison:I'm female, over 70, 5'4"", size 3X. I like to put on a hoodie against the morning chill nearly every day except in summer, and I have an array of colors. I usually buy men's because they're better value, warmer, and come in plus sizes.Hanes and Fruit of the Loom appear to be of similar quality, but I haven't had either long enough to wear it out, so I can't say if one is more durable.Hanes are heavier weight, of thicker material, and slightly warmer. I find them too warm for in the house except on really cool days.Fruit of the Loom are 60% cotton, 40% polyester. Hanes are 90% cotton, 10% polyester. You can feel the polyester in the Fruit of the Loom; it's soft but plastic-y, if you know what I mean, and the fabric doesn't breathe as well. If I were doing something where I would work up a sweat, I'd choose Hanes, even though it's heavier.Fit: Hanes fits like it's intended for a big man, not a plump, big bellied person of either sex. It is broader in the shoulders and long in the arms. I have somewhat longish arms for a woman, and if it weren't for the ribbed cuff, it would completely cover my hands. As it is, there's a lot of material bunched up on my arms. To get a size large enough to zip over my stomach, it looks too big in the shoulders. Hanes is also slightly longer. I look like I borrowed my husband's hoodie. Fruit of the Loom is less aggressively gendered, more unisex. It fits better in the shoulders and chest. The sleeves, when extended, come just to my knuckles. There isn't a lot of material bunched up on the arms. The thinner material makes it less bulky to wear.Overall, I prefer the fit and look of the Fruit of the Loom over the bulk of the Hanes, but I like the feel and breathability of Hanes' higher cotton content. If I were a fit, tall, broad shouldered man, I would choose Hanes. But as I'm not, it's a toss-up, fit vs. comfort.Edited to add an issue with the Fruit of the Loom hoodie: it sheds little pills of lint over whatever you wear under it, even after 2 washes. Not a good look. I had decided to go with Fruit of the Loom in the future, but that tips the scale in favor of Hanes.",4
B08YGTLS7P,These for the loom sweatshirts are very comfortable and very well made. I've been wearing one at work for three straight years and there's not a thread out of place. For about $16 you get a comfortable zip up hoodie of any color. Highly recommended.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Great lightweight hoodie.  These hoodies will not last a lifetime but they are great for around the house and underneath a jacket for a little extra warmth.  The zipper is good quality, that is what always breaks on other hoodies.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"As a 5'7"",180 lb senior, it is often difficult finding clothes that fit me. This sweatshirt in Large is perfect for me, as the sleeves have stretchy cuffs to pull up a couple inches and the rest is perfect. I have a ten-year-old one that's looking a little scrappy now and will now be my dedicated yard work shirt. Great value!",5
B08YGTLS7P,"My partner does not like to wear jacket so I have been looking for a very thin jacket but can still keep you warm. This was it!! Simple style, fits great and no shrinkage as of right now",5
B08YGTLS7P,I have ordered 2 different times from Fruit of the Loom and the 2nd order was perfect!  I ordered a red and blue and fit perfectly.I ordered the same hoodies in 2024 and was very disappointed because they sent me women's hoodies because the zipper was on the wrong side for a guy to use.  I did not return them and just wore them.  The second time around is a thumbs up!,5
B08YGTLS7P,I purchased these to put logos on for my cafe for the chillier months.  They are great quality and wash up real nice!,5
B08YGTLS7P,He has a hoodie he works in but it has become stained by all the projects. I wanted to get a hoodie he could wear away from home. It runs a little small.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Absolutely 100% accurate size chart. True to size. The size chart says the 3x fits a 55in bust. It is almost precisely that-- 55in bust. The outside of the fabric looks and feels like a sweat shirt material. The inside is more fleece like. It's not going to keep me warm in 30 degrees Fahrenheit. But in 67 degrees with a slight wind chill, it's perfect. It's exactly as described. I would just suggest that if anyone is like me and they want a hoodie to fit more loosely, size up. And definitely measure your bust by wrapping a string around your chest and placing that string next to a ruler. Then, order your size based on the size chart in the product description. I highly recommend.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"If you hold the hoody up in front of a light, you can see the light through it. In spite of this, the hoodie is warm and very soft. It fits nicely, and looks great, but did shrink a tad in the dryer. I recommend hanging it to dry if you want to avoid that.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"Great for the price!  This is the second Hanes hoodie I have purchased (bought 2 on a trip to Florida about 20 years ago).  Since I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area, this is about all the Winter coat I need!",5
B08YGTLS7P,"I bought this sweatshirt to use at work, as we couldn't have any other logos on our clothes except the company we worked for. As someone with Autism, the sweatshirt was made the same way that it was when I originally bought it from walmart in 2017, which is why I sought it out. The fit runs a bit big, but thats how I like my zip ups. Only complaint is that the stitching on the right pocket is coming undone and the pocket is coming apart. Other than that, not bad for over a year of almost daily use.",4
B08YGTLS7P,Good quality. Very comfortable. Looks great. Fits true to size. Never wear a hoodie without a zipper.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Outside of pocket is coming unsewn after 2 washes,4
B08YGTLS7P,size is perfect looks amazing and is the perfect stretch amount nothing much else to add simply a good quality jacket for cheap.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"I bought this to use under down jacket or with vest. I wear it everywhere-in the house for warmth. Soft, warm, comfortable. I am going to buy another one this month. I got it on right now. It is really comfortable. I have not washed. I wash clothes similar to this is cold to warm and air dry in the dryer. I do not use heat. Most everything seems to last years.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"I got the black and a red one. 3xFirst impression... I'm impressed!I'm a size 22/24 with big boobs. I usually buy things a 2x or 3x.This was almost too big for me. I'll certainly keep them to wear bigger sweaters and stuff.They cover my butt. The sleeves come past my hands. Not tight at all, but not too loose.The material isn't the thickest, and that's OK. Not thin either. Perfect for those chilly days when you wanna layer up without being too bulky or it being too heavy. And it's fairly easily packable.I definitely recommend this.",4
B08YGTLS7P,"I needed this jacket, It looks and feels really good.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Very soft the touch I like the way it looks,5
B08YGTLS7P,Nice jacket for chilly weather. Soft against the skin feel. True to size. Not heavy dnough for the winter weather.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Good for dtf or htv vinyl.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Only costs a few bucks, is warm enough for just out and about in the house or outside in colder weather - Perfect.Bought one for me and my wife and we are both content.",5
B08YGTLS7P,I like it it's light weight not heavy and don't shrink after washing.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Very comfortable and warm. Good quality in low price I bought 4 of them.,5
B08YGTLS7P,I got two of these for my husband. He loves it and it had his size. These hoodies are comfortable and love the colors and the price it great.  We have used this brand for many years and love it.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it, super comfy!",5
B08YGTLS7P,"These are as good as can be expected!  Fit true to size, wash well, amazing color, and are super comfortable.  Highly recommend!(Face erased in pic for privacy reasons)",5
B08YGTLS7P,The material is comfortable and the quality is good. Although thinner than I was wanting it is still good under a coat or vest,4
B08YGTLS7P,Came quick. Got me through below freezing temps. Fits good and didn't shrink too much when washed.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Grandson loved hoodie. Quality was great and very comfortable.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Love these for the price. Will be purchasing more!,5
B08YGTLS7P,"High visibility color & Fruit of the Loom brand name attracted me to this hooded sweatshirt.  The material is quite thin so it won't keep you warm on a cold windy day.  Had I felt the material at a store, I would not have purchased this item.  However, having worn this sweatshirt on early autumn evening walks, I found it to be surprisingly warm & comfortable.  I also liked the high visibility color for safety during evening walks.",4
B08YGTLS7P,"10/10 would recommend. If you are looking for a black hoodie that zips up in the front, this sweatshirt is one of those.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"Love this sweater it is perfect for lounging. I wear this on a daily basis. It is cozy and soft. The only thing I did dislike is that they changed the kind of dye they use and it had a chemical odor through the first few washes. Really didn't like that part, but once that smell dissipates it is really great.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Fits right and is good quality. I'm happy,5
B08YGTLS7P,Fits great and is soft and warm.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Very comfortable,5
B08YGTLS7P,Good quality and true to size,5
B08YGTLS7P,It fits dad and is comfortable.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Good,5
B08YGTLS7P,Soft quality super great deal,5
B08YGTLS7P,Love the color and size.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Great purchase. Will buy another,4
B08YGTLS7P,"Great price. Nice soft material. However, i did buy the next size up and it fits perfect. 6'3"", 260lbs. Ordered a 3x.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"It was ok ,",4
B08YGTLS7P,"I love these Fruit of the Loom EverSoft, Fleece, Full Zip Hoodies and Sweatshirts.They are lightweight, and comfortable. Sizing is accurate. The reasonable pricing cinches the deal.Immediately became my go to favorite hoodies and sweatshirts.Buy them!",5
B08YGTLS7P,"this zip up is really comfortable, its soft and its not too thick or thin. would buy again!",5
B08YGTLS7P,This sweatshirt is perfect for the northern temps. It is soft and cozy. I purchased 3 colors,5
B08YGTLS7P,As described,5
B08YGTLS7P,no problems,5
B08YGTLS7P,"The product I NEEDED! I've been searching for a Jacket that matches with everything and is not expensive and this is it, I got the black one for 13.00 because black matches with every color and it is absolute perfection. I've washed t maybe 5 times and nothing happened so... Absolutley need. I personally sized up a few sizes because I prefer an over sized fit. I bought a small for my six year old and it was great, it was a little oversize which was what I was looking for. It is soft on the inside. Each of my children got one as well as me and it was less than 70 dollars, for 5 people. This is a need for cold temps and fall temps.",5
B08YGTLS7P,"No rips, tears, or holes!  Seems true to size.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Muy buena calidad y muy buen precio .,5
B08YGTLS7P,"I really like these sweatsuits.  The title expresses what I like about them.  Now here are my dislikes:#1. There's a LOT of pilling that takes place (between legs most notably).  Being that these sweatsuits are made of a blend (both tops and bottoms) they're prone to pilling due to the poly content.#2.  I've noticed loose hanging threads.  Most recently, a Heather Grey hooded zip-up that I purchased started to come apart at the seams.  This was noted in the hood area of the garment.  Amazon has granted me a no nonsense return.  I haven't worn this item more than twice and this transpired.Here's what I've done to remedy the pilling.  I turn them inside out before washing these sweatsuits on delicate in cold water.  I only wash like colors together and I allow them to air dry .  I don't shave them down as that could create a hole in the fabric (pilling happens when the material begins to pop in areas).  If the fuzz ball is too unsightly , I'll cut it with a sharp scissor. I leave the small fuzzes be.  I also utilize fabric softener this reduces the friction that takes place when clothing is washed together.  I don't try to force other items that are the same color into the load.  I wash these sweatsuits separately & like colors (black sweatsuit with dark blue).  Usually the red, burgundy, & white suits I wash alone.  If I have a stain I spray it with SHOUT as soon as it's noticed to keep colors vibrant I use Clorox 2.*Anyways that's my story & I'm sticking to it...",4
B08YGTLS7P,this is simply the koolest jacket ever ty.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Runs true to size, unlike other brands. I plan to layer it under a heavier layer. Good quality zipper.",4
B08YGTLS7P,"I ordered these in 6 different colors for my partner and I to share. They are super comfortable, fit just right, warm but not too thick, obsessed.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Thin but cheap price. Will work for early spring and fall,4
B08YGTLS7P,For the price this is a great value.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Not bad just light fabric rips kinda easily,4
B08YGTLS7P,I was wanting a lightweight blaze orange sweatshirt to wear in the woods and this is perfect! Good quality for the price.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"This is exactly what i wanted.  I needed some more warmth on the jobsite, but not too much. I'm 75inches tall and weigh 350lbs and it fits nice and roomy.  The zipper works great and is reliable.  You can't beat the price.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Very light weightNice for the price,4
B08YGTLS7P,ONE OF OUR FAVORITE HOODIE,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Thin, but exactly what you would expect for the price. Great color",5
B08YGTLS7P,this was bought as a gift for my grandson.  as far as i know it's fine...  no complaints so far,5
B08YGTLS7P,"My niece loved it, soft and cuddly. Wears every day in college to stay warm but not hot or bulky.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Very nice and fits well,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Great color, quality. Bought as gift.",5
B08YGTLS7P,Should have sized down. My fault. The jackets are true to size.,5
B08YGTLS7P,"When they titled it ""Eversoft"", they weren't kidding. Even after a few washes, the texture isn't harsh at all! I chose the full zip because I like the option of showing my t-shirt underneath. I'm not a fashion guru by any means, but Idk, it looks good to me. Also, if I roll up the sleeves and unzip the front, it's not as hot if I wear the sweater out in the blazing sun. I like to stash this hoodie in my carry on bag for flights because of it's versatility in various weather conditions.As for the actual fit, take my opinion with a grain of salt because I like my hoodies oversized and roomy. I am regularly an Adult Men's Medium, but with sweaters and the like, I order a size up. To give a reference on how oversized I wear them, the sleeves cover up my wrists and hands, while the bottom of the front pocket drapes below my waist. Another reason why I order a size up is because in the event it isn't pre-shrunk, the hoodie still has a loose and comfy fit.For the moisture wicking and breathable features of the hoodie, I can't give an accurate answer. Where I'm located at, it doesn't rain very often. Although, when I do wear it in cloudy weather, I don't notice the excess moisture or terrible ""wet dog"", mildew smell (Eww, gross). Even if it does smell, just throw it in the wash. You don't have to worry about the fabric wearing down because it's Eversoft! Not bad for a fleece hoodie under $16, eh?",5
B08YGTLS7P,Very affordable comfortable hoodie.,5
B08YGTLS7P,Like that it's lightweight,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Although the waistband is cheap and could definitely be made with a higher quality materials. I only wear them inside the house. And,as pajamas.",4
B08YGTLS7P,It fit me right. Material is thinner than I thought it would be..,5
B08YGTLS7P,"Comfortable, roomy, and warm",5
B08YGTLS7P,"I like mine. It was cheap, comfortable and perfect to just toss on when a coat is too heavy for todays activity.",5
B07K1JQQLG,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            You can tell these are very high quality. My boyfriend really liked how they are easy to move around in and there are lots of pockets with zippers it comes with. He is 6 foot 2 and the sizing was perfect with the length they come in. They are very comfy and look so good!,5
B07K1JQQLG,Great fit very comfortable and fine fabricCan be worn to work out or as I do on a plane for a great look and comfortable flight,5
B07K1JQQLG,"Love the fit. Super comfortable.  Only complaint is color faded slightly after 1st wash, even though washed in cold water. Everything else was perfect.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"These pants are great and sooo comfortable. They are not too lightweight nor bulky and heavy. They are just right, fit well, are soft and comfortable. Will definitely buy more.",5

B07K1JQQLG,"The SCR SPORTSWEAR Men's Sweatpants are designed to offer comfort and functionality for various activities, including workouts, running, lounging, and casual wear. Here's a review of their features:Pros:Comfortable Fabric: Constructed from a blend of polyester and spandex, these sweatpants provide a soft and stretchy feel that allows for ease of movement during physical activities.Moisture-Wicking: The fabric is designed to wick away sweat and moisture, helping to keep you dry and comfortable during intense workouts or runs.Adjustable Fit: The elastic waistband with an adjustable drawstring ensures a customized fit, allowing you to achieve the desired level of comfort and security.Zipper Pockets: The inclusion of zipper pockets provides convenient storage for small essentials like keys, cards, or a phone, minimizing the risk of items falling out during activities.Stylish Design: With a modern design featuring tapered legs and contrasting details, these sweatpants offer a sleek and athletic look suitable for both active and casual wear.Cons:Durability Concerns: Some users may find that the fabric or stitching doesn't hold up well over time, particularly with frequent washing or intense workouts.Sizing Issues: Like many apparel items, sizing can vary, and some users may find that the sweatpants run either too large or too small compared to standard sizing.Limited Color Options: Depending on personal preferences, individuals may find the available color options to be limited, especially if they prefer a wider range of choices.Overall, the SCR SPORTSWEAR Men's Sweatpants offer a blend of comfort, functionality, and style suitable for various activities and lifestyles. While they provide several convenient features such as moisture-wicking fabric and zipper pockets, potential concerns regarding durability and sizing variations should be taken into consideration when making a purchase. Nevertheless, for many users, these sweatpants offer a practical and stylish option for everyday wear and active pursuits alike.",5
B07K1JQQLG,Finally a pair of sweat pants for tall men.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"2nd pair we've purchased for my husband. He likes them and they launder well. Took off 1 star as we ordered the platinum color and received the green Instead. He likes the color well enough that we'll keep them, but this mistake could have gone either way.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"We have 2 grandsons, 6'6"" and 6'7"" who wear this brand most of the time.  The quality is very good.  Wash well and last",5
B07K1JQQLG,Material and fit is excellent,5
B07K1JQQLG,Look and feel great,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I have owned three pairs of these pants over the years. I am 6'2"" and 175 pounds, so finding pants like these that fit is next to impossible. I really like having inseam and waist measurements.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I bought 5 pairs of these pants for my husband--nice color selection and good fit. The dark grays and black were just right. But the light gray pair had something sharp sticking out the zippered back pocket on the inside. The plastic zipper end was sewn into the seam and teeth sticking out about 1/4 inch. Returned them and ordered another pair same color. Same problem! I ripped a little of the seam out, snipped as much of the sharp ends as I could, and resewed to completely cover the zipper end. Husband said it worked so we'll see. Manufacturer needs to correct back pocket zipper problem in the light gray pants--customers don't want to pay $50 for new pants and have to fix them to be wearable.",3
B07K1JQQLG,"These are great sweatpants.  This is my third pair.  They are nicely cut, the fabric is a great medium weight and it stretches.  My one complaint is that they are listed at various lengths but in reality they are all extra long.  This was not the case in the past but I think they made a decision to cut down on inventory and only stock the longest inseams.  This isn't a problem if they tell you.  But they don't.  They make you think you're ordering a custom length but there's only one length.  Extra long.  So if you're not 6' 3"" add another $10-$15 to the cost to get them altered.",4
B07K1JQQLG,The only thing that kept me from five stars for this item with zippered pockets. I just wish they weren't zippered. The fabric is lightweight. It's breathable durable washable. The length is actually as stated and it's very comfortable. I would highly recommend it to anyone,4
B07K1JQQLG,My husband loves these pants for casual or golf.  This is his 4th pair!,5
B07K1JQQLG,Have 3 colors. So far holding up without problems.,5
B07K1JQQLG,I will continue to buy these pants as long as they sell them.,5
B07K1JQQLG,Just received these. Very impressed with feel.  Heavier weight than i was expecting but they're very comfortable. So nice to find a company that makes a length to fit!  Waist is snug without feeling tight. Like the zippered pockets. And it's great they're made in the U.S.A.!!,5
B07K1JQQLG,good fit,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I had bought a pair of these pants several years ago. I really liked them and thought I would make these my main workout pants. So I ordered 2 pairs on amazon. I only wear them to the gym 3 times a week. After a couple of months one of the pairs had a hole in them by the pocket. I was pretty sure I didn't get them snagged on anything and I had only washed them a couple of times. I contacted the company since the return window had closed on amazon. They said send them a picture of the damage and they would send me a new pair. True to their word they sent me the new pants. These are really nice looking pants, you could wear them all day if you wanted. They are really long though. I wear a 34/34 in Levi's and the 34/34 in these pants I have to pull up to my belly button to keep them from bunching up on the bottom. Next time I order them I will get the 34/32.",5
B07K1JQQLG,Thanks!,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I recently purchased this, and they have quickly become my go-to pants for various activities. The fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable. The fit is spot on. They are neither too baggy nor too tight, striking a perfect balance.These sweatpants offer everything I need in terms of comfort, functionality, and style. Highly recommended for anyone looking for reliable and stylish athletic pants!",5
B07K1JQQLG,Finally workout pants long enough!,5
B07K1JQQLG,Happy with the fit and quality.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"Finally a pair of athletic pants that are long enough for me. I am 6'0 and weigh about 165lbs. I have about a 35in inseam, which makes it nearly impossible to find a pair of athletic pants or sweat pants that are long enough. Also, most pants that would be long enough are way too large in the waist. For some reason most clothing companies assume that if you're tall, you also have a large waist. It's nice to see a company which makes pants for people who are tall and lean.I bought a size Medium x 36L (Slim). I have a 32in waist and 35in inseam and they fit very well. They are probably even a little longer than I need, so if I wanted I could have them hemmed. The little extra length doesn't bother me tho, especially when I'm wearing shoes.I purchased the slim fit because I didn't want them to be baggy. They have a nice tapered fit, but aren't super tight and I still feel like I have plenty of room to move in them. The fabric is pretty soft, although when I don't have shorts on underneath I do find that the seams are noticeable against my legs. It doesn't bother me anymore now that I have gotten used to it, but if you're sensitive to things like that you may not like it.  The pockets are nice, but the openings aren't overly large. If you are tall and lean, and have difficulty finding athletic pants that are long enough for you, than definitely buy these pants.",4
B07K1JQQLG,I really like to soft cotton feel and they fit great. Part polyester so they hand the wash well.,5
B07K1JQQLG,Was this made in China? or what? I'm very disappointed at the quality of these pants when I gave them to my hubby he loved them we didn't wash them but they were too long so I told him lets wash and see if they shrink.. and this was the end result... I have the newer kind of washer and dryers & it has no agitators> so I have no clue other than the sewing Job was horrible on these ones I have yet to wash the grey pair. Not sure if I want to wash the other pair or just return them cause of how cheaply made they are....... Hoping maybe if I do wash the grey pair they wont do this? maybe it was/is a fluke? maybe the sewing operator on this one just screwed up the sewing job? not sure.. anyway really dissatisfied. UPDATE FRom DAy of Purchase> I will not buy this brand ever again they are the cheapest made piece of junk they tear when you wash and tumble dry the string part is what separates whom every made these really did a POOR JOB< Returned all products at least they honored it as far as the company giving a refund they did the job well but as far as the Pants They Truly Stink and I would never recommend to anyone. we bouight 4 pair everyone tore on 1 wash 1 wash!,5
B07K1JQQLG,Is a good Sports pants is really sad that.there is no more color's and seems there will no supply anymore,5
B07K1JQQLG,Very comfortable. Have 8 pair of these.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I ordered these for my husband, who is 6'5"" tall. It is really difficult to find any type of pants that fit both his waist and leg length. These allowed for that, and they fit him perfectly. He also reports that they are very comfortable, and he likes them a lot.",5
B07K1JQQLG,Length is great. Hard to find sweatpants for someone so tall and these work great.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"Having been disappointed far too many times when ordering extra-long track or sweatpants, I was ready for yet another return.  But these pants are perfect.I am 6'6"" and the 36"" inseam on these is perfect with just a little fabric sitting on top of my shoes.  The legs taper nicely below the knee but are roomy in the thigh for more those of us with more athletic legs.And you don't need a zipper section at the ankles as the stretch fabric has enough to give to slide off athletic shoes if you do so carefully.I wore them to walk a half-mile to the gym today in 20-degree temps with blustery winds and was amply warm all the way.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"Background: Tall (over 6'6"") slim.  Run regularly, free weights/body weight fitness couple times a week. Finding comfortable athletic pants are difficulty.  Other big brands tend to be too short to the ankles (even the tall sizes) or too loose in the middle.This order:  I started by emailing the seller asking what they suggested for size and fit. They recommended, based on my information, medium longs or m 36/38 depending on style I chose. I went with M 36.  I am very satisfied.  The pants drop just to where I want on my ankles.  Fit is appropriate between the legs, and around the waist.  Pants are comfortable and look better than I expected.  Stitching looks to be good, no threads dangling.  I like them to the point I will purchase another pair of a different style and color.  I tend to wear these daily when the temperature gets cooler.I have a reminder set to update this in about 4-6 months after regular washing and wear. I can be rough on stuff, so long term durability is worth reviewing at a later date.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I am 6'3"" and 180lbs.  I ordered 32x36 in black tapered. I've never found a pair of athletic/sweat pants that fit correctly - until now!  All pants I tried previously either fit in the waist and were too short, or, they were the correct length but the waist was too big.  These pants fit perfectly, and they are the MOST COMFORTABLE pants I've ever owned.  I was so happy with the fit, feel and quality that I ordered two additional pairs.  I now have 3 identical pairs and I wear them every chance I get.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"My 17 year old son has been wearing these pants for the last 3 years. We buy him approximately 4 pair a year. He doesn't care for jeans, so these have been a nice compromise for us as I do not care for the look of jogging pants or typical track pants. He wears the men's medium, regular length (32/32) with great success.They have held up well to daily wear (he plays volleyball multiple times a week and is an avid disc golfer) but they do fade after a few months.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"I bought several pairs of sweat pants a few years ago and love them. The material is quality and the fit is great however, over time the elastic in the waist band lost all its elasticity causing the waist size to greatly increase several sizes bigger.",3
B07K1JQQLG,Quality of product is excellent and expectations are always met!,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I almost never leave reviews. Only when the product is exceptionally good or bad. This one is squarely in the former category. I had what I thought were simple requirements, that apparently were too much to ask for because I tried at least six pairs. Finally got these and boy are these awesome.They fit and look like regular casual trousers. Not baggy, but not too tight, and very comfortable (I ordered the straight leg ones). The size is pretty standard, so you get what you expect. I have actually been wearing them as a jeans alternative. Will order another pair.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"These SCR jogger pants are the best. I am 6.4 tall and thank you Amazon for carrying these pants. There are no place like here to find perfect brand like SCR for my size.I love these pants. I washed many times and traveled on plane with them a lot. They have three zipper pockets which is great to keep cash, passport. wallets and personal items without losing them while traveling.Please never stop selling these TALL JOGGER PANTs on this platform.",5
B07K1JQQLG,They are well made and hold up nicely after many washings.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I got them in XXL after reading some of the reviews and I think I probably could have gone with XL, as they didn't shrink that much in the wash. That said, the style and fit are excellent and the quality seems like they will hold up well",5
B07K1JQQLG,Stitches on inseam broken and or loose.,3
B07K1JQQLG,"My husband is 6'2, 210"".  His legs aren't super long,  so I find many Big and Tall companies long pants are too long, but if we get regulars they are too short.  We have been looking for years and these sweatpants were perfect!  We are going to order more colors and wouldn't have guessed that Amazon was the place to go.  He also likes the fast that they are just thick enough, but not too thick and that there aren't logos all over.  Just a very small octagon near the pocket.  We ordered the slim 34 x 33 since the 34 x 34 were sold out and they were perfect.  Highly recommend and took the time to review (which I normally don't do enough of) because if there are other men out there like my husband having a hard time finding pants, than you need this review.",5
B07K1JQQLG,Wrinkle free.  Great for traveling.,5
B07K1JQQLG,Thes pants fit so much better that the old-style sweatpants that are so baggy and the crouch is at your knees. These pants fit great are very comfortable and come in a large variety of sizes including many length options. They are well worth the price and look great for all occasions.,5
B07K1JQQLG,I bought these for my husband. He's 6'3 and has a hard time finding athletic pants that are long enough. Being able to choose the inseam is great.  He said they are very comfortable and loves the length.  They are cut more generously through the leg so they look more laid back than some other more slightly fitted ones he has that are a little more flattering.  He definitely enjoys having this pair.,4
B07K1JQQLG,"Zippers! What the heck is up with the zippers on these pants!?!?! They stick in the closed position. It's only by luck that I can unzip them again. I have to walk around with the zips open because I'm afraid of getting my car keys stuck in my pants and not being able to get home again! They need to fix the zippers on these pants. Otherwise, they are OK.Update: The zips on the new pair I received from them work perfectly! so that's great. I recommend these pants. They are good quality. I use them as casual wear and they work great for that. These are great if you are taller or shorter than normal. There is very little to choose from in exercise clothing if you are taller than normal, like me. I'm 6'3"" and need tall sizes.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"My son is a slim 6'5 and these are the only athletic pants we can find to fit him.  We have four pairs.  He likes the fit--you can choose both waist and length, so something that finally fits him well.  He also likes the zipper phone case.  I wish more companies would make pants for slim and tall guys, not just big and tall guys.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I am 6'0, 210, 48 years old ""somewhat athletic"" and took a chance on these  because the description said the length is longer than average.  The legs are long but personally I like that better than the look of pants that are too short  I wouldn't call these slim fit but they are snug in the buttocks and in the thigh but acceptable.  The material stretches and is comfortable.  I guess my only complaint is that in less than 2 months the drawstring holes ripped when I was pulling the strings but everything still works I just don't know how long it will hold up.  I would purchase again though.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"When it comes to sweatpants, I am the pickiest person there is. I am 6 ft tall with long legs and it was impossible to find sweatpants that satisfied me. For years. They were either too short or too long. Finally, I found these! OMG. Best ever. Perfect fit. My size is 32 waist and 34 inseam. For sure I will be buying more at some point. I highly highly recommend!",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I've tried these twice now, once working out and once while moving. Unless you're outdoors they're probably going to be too hot to work out in, but you probably know that since you're not buying shorts. Length is a little longer than expected due to a lower rise; at a 34L it still covers my shoes while sitting, but it's not too bunched up. I love these for moving around, cleaning, etc.Why I prefer these over other brands I've bought: pockets that zip so your phone/wallet doesn't tumble, tall sizes available, leg width is loose but not balloon-pant loose like other brands. I also have tried some with a zipper on the bottom, and found it to be annoying when I took my shoes off and hard to wash without destroying other clothes.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"If fits very well. I wore it hiking in Colorado, and it worked well against heat. I was not sure why it was advertised for Fishing rather than Hiking; I suspect now that part of it is about the vent at the back - it is useless under a backpack.The only negative is color. It is sold as a nice natural-looking light green; it is nothing like that. More like Mountain Dew dissolved in water. I think it may glow in the dark, at least, it looks as if it does. I had read somebody else's review saying that this shirt scared away all wildlife; it was an exaggeration, but it had considerable truth as well.",4
B07K1JQQLG,I really like these pants. The only complaint I have is one pair I own the stitching on the pocket came undone.,4
B07K1JQQLG,"These pants are very durable.  I have purchased them in many colors, as it has been hard to find pants to fit my slim 6'3"" tall, teenage son.  They look nice on my son and he wears them with comfort.  I am happy to have found these.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I bought these for my husband and they look very nice and well made.However, he wanted something a bit heavier to keep him warm this winter.  No problems with the quality and look of these pants.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"Good quality materials,  comfortable,  fit fairly well... actually fit as expected overall except they aren't quite as long as described.  I was SO hopeful that I had found active wear that was TRULY extra tall (37-38"") as described and was willing to pay the premium price.  These are more like a 36""...j u s t barely.  I am keeping them as they are very nice athletic pants, very nice...and they will work for now (I'm currently in a wheelchair,  so they're OK for Phys.Therapy, Drs appts,etc) but I probably wouldn't wear them in too public of situations if/ when I'm back on my feet as they are just a bit too short.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"I am 6'4"", 195 lbs. My normal pant size is 34 waist/36 inseam. I ordered a Large waist/36"" inseam and the fit is almost perfect. About 1/2"" too long, and I would have tapered the leg down a bit more to the ankle openings, but I am only mentioning it for the sake of this review, as both are really trivial issues. What I like most about them is they ""sit low on the hips"", like Levi 501 jeans, so they are snug around waist and crotch. I bought these to wear for my daily 3.5 mile very-early morning walk when weather is too cold for shorts, and they definitely fit the bill. I will be ordering another pair.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"We have been searching for MONTHS for a good fitting athletic pant for a tall teen boy. We think this is the one! *not four stars yet..as they have not been washed, but trying them on out of the bag  - fit was perfect with some room at the length...they go past the shoe even! so there is room for shrinkage! More than what I'd pay usually, but if I got the pricey brands..they were TOO short and HUGE!",4
B07K1JQQLG,"These are listed as ""70% cotton, 20% polyester, and 10% spandex."" They are not - the tag in mine says 35% cotton, 60% polyester, and 5% lycra. They have a feel of a heavy jersey knit fabric, not bad but not soft and not very warm.However the 36"" inseam really is and these are the only thing close to sweats I've been able to find that are long enough! That part is great and this fit is good.",3
B07K1JQQLG,"My husband is 6'2"" 180 lbs. with a slim athletic build who usually wears 34""/35"" waist x 34"" length for dress slacks.  We ordered a 34"" waist and 33"" length in the slim fit and they are perfect with his tennis shoes since he doesn't need them as long as the dress slacks he wears with dress shoes.  He likes the pockets but wishes they had a zipper opening at the hemline.  The material has a give and should be good for work outs.  My husband is hard to fit for workout pants as they are always too short so this is a perfect fit!",5
B07K1JQQLG,"My husband loves these pants, fits him perfectly!  I would have given 5 stars, but the pocket zipper was faulty from the first time he wore the pants.  The pants were a gift to him, so he didn't tell me soon enough to exchange.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"Pants as advertised. Looks like high-quality workmanship. As a tall skinny guy, getting pants long enough is important tp me, and this is easily worth some extra cost. FYI, these are lower rise than most sweatpants, i.e., they sit below my natural waist. So this is probably good or bad depending on your preference.",4
B07K1JQQLG,Being my height and on the thin body size it is extremely difficult to find pants like this. They feel like golf pants but half the price. They are nice and light. I normally wear 38w 38L and these are long. Went with 36L on my next pair. Pockes are nice and have zippers. I normally wear golf pants most days so these are going to be my daily pants since they do have that normally workout pant look.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I'm 6'7"" and 270. I have trouble finding clothes that fit. These are great!!!! Well made and lot's of length without being baggy. I will definitely buy these again!!",5
B07K1JQQLG,"At 6'4""  200lbs it's difficult to find my sizeOff the shelf is S M L XL XXL .nice to get size specific for my body typeZip pockets a must for (keys don't slide out when sitting)Very comfortable and flexible, but looks slightly tailored on me,Would wear going in to a store if needed ( still have not embraced work out cloths are daily cloths)Also very comfortable for late night lounging or morning coffee",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I am 6'3"" tall and all of my sweatpants are always way too short - shrinking after few washes. I have fully expected these sweatpants to shrink as well since they are made of cotton (actually majority cotton + synthetic), so I ordered couple sizes longer than my actual size. However they did not shrink. I washed them several times and they are still the same size - which is great. I know for the next pair I will need to order my actual size.Otherwise they are very comfortable, fit great and look great too. They are stretchy but do not loose shape. I will certainly buy more of them.",5
B07K1JQQLG,They are perfect for my husband. He is dealing with cancer diagnosis and recent strokes. The pants look so smart on him as well as being comfortable and well made.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"I am 6 foot 3 inches tall, and these ""34 inch"" length pants are 2-3 inches TOO LONG.  You will need to go to a tailor to have them altered unless you are exceptionally tall.",2
B07K1JQQLG,These sweatpants are made with high quality material and are very comfortable. The waistband is sized perfectly but the inseam is about an inch longer than I expected. The pockets are good sized and secure with quality zippers. I will buy more in the future.,5
B07K1JQQLG,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            XXL/34 fits my son with an average waist very well! See pictures and video to get an idea on how these fit and look.Soft and stretchy material, perfect for lounging yet look good! My son really likes these and so do I because they fit him! No more butt crack when he bends over, and no more looking like he's ready to tread in high water! Love em!",5
B07K1JQQLG,not the same material as previously purchased pants,1
B07K1JQQLG,"With a 32x38 pant size finding panda is extremely hard to find. Glad I found these. They fit excellent and not like long shorts on my long legs. Quality is good, pockets are just right. Want to order every color.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"I am 6'6"" with a 36"" inseam and it is hard to find pants to fit.  I found these that came in tall sizes and thought i would give them a try.  These are great.  I wear them all the time.  They are soft and comfortable with some stretch to the fabric.  The length is just right and doesn't make me look like i'm ready to wade through some water.  The fit through the seat and thighs are not baggy but the fabric will stretch through movement and it is comfortable and looks good.  I'm buying more when these wear out.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"Incredibly comfortable, great fit. Just bought my 3rd pair and love them. Only downside is the first pair wore out too quickly (one year) in the seat (ride my bike in them every day). My other riding pants lasted significantly longer. Yet they fit and move so well I will continue to buy them for both riding and everyday use.",4
B07K1JQQLG,"They're long enough and that's mostly what I was looking for. They're not too baggy and not tight like yoga pants so that's also a win. The material is thin enough that you can wear them to the gym but thick enough that they do provide a basic level of warmth. These are not super thick sweat pants so if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere. I'm 6'5"" and 200 lbs and the 36-inch inseams fit wonderfully. They also stretch so they can easily be worn for all types of sports or athletics. I definitely recommend them if you're looking for some nice athletic pants.",5
B07K1JQQLG,"Purchased these for my husband who wears a large in every other brand.  Had to exchange for an extra large and extra long to get the equivalent standard size for him.  Having said that, the sweat pants now fit great, the material is superb and the quality is a nice surprise.  We've paid more for less in the past so this gets a 5 star rating.  Will definitely buy more next time he needs a pair of sweatpants.  These will be our go-to.",5
B07K1JQQLG,The fit,5
B07K1JQQLG,"These were slim, so I guess I expected somewhat of a tapered fit. But these were just overall a very odd fit for me. The waist to thighs were weirdly cut, causing a uncomfortable fit for me. I have bigger thighs, but these just seemed to be designed around an odd shaped body. These are a thicker material so I just felt very restricted in these. Overall would not recommend the slim. I'd possibly try the other cut and see how those fit my body.",3
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Length was good! My husband is 6""1 240 and the Xl was loose around waist. Probably would need to size down if you don't have a wide waist! Material thickness was thick and quality. Very warm! Functions well.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,A very comfortable and form fitting pant that definitely keeps my legs warm. Solid material and definitely does its job.,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,At first they were a little bit big on me. I can fix thatDurable comfortable easy to wear Yes worth the valueMachine washable and dryable in the dryer on low heat. Yes as a customer standpoint they are comfortable and there's different colors too keep you Nice and warm.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Absolutely fabulous long underwear. Now that I'm getting older, I am also getting colder in winter. But I have always hated layers! I don't like the bulky feeling. But these were so very soft and felt so good next to my skin. I'm really pleased with how they feel under my clothes. They held up well after washing, and I am a fan for life!",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Very low price probably will not last long. holding up to the washer. Warmth is adequate and as expected,3
B08D2Q4NDZ,"My ""standard"" waist size is 34.  Typically,  I purchase briefs in size 34-36, mostly tagged as ""Large"".Since I am at the low-end of waist size, I ordered these long john bottoms in ""Medium"".  The waist band elastic was still too large!  Otherwise these fit snugly through the legs and seat.If I re-order, I will try ""Small"", for a waist that may fit.",4
B08D2Q4NDZ,They fit well and are warm without being too warm.  Sorely needed this winter.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Now that the colder weather has moved in I certainly enjoy using these. I've used them about four or five times they do fit me well. Can't wait to see what happens when I wash them to see how this shrinkage is. My main concern is how the waistband will last. And some other products same price or cheaper the waistband gives out after a while.,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,Good fit. Nice material.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Made well and fits perfect,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,The pair I received is larger than expected for the labelled size but functional. They keep me warmer.,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,They fit perfect and are very warm. A+,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,These have been washed many times and are still stretchy. They are very warm but not overly so. I have been wearing them at work and home with temps below zero.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"I recently started working nights and found myself needing to be prepared for some cold nights, so I looked at many options and settled for these. Being cheap enough that I wasn't worried about losing the cost, I find them mostly comfortable and warm enough for near freezing temperatures. Comfortable and warm so far.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Great warm layer. True to size,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Works as Designed,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,I bought these for my husband to help keep him warm at work. He says they are comfortable and do a great job keeping him warm. I would buy them again.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Very comfortable and fit great.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"I ordered the Fruit of the Loom Long John Bottoms in a XXL size. The Site kept trying to get me to order the XL size, but I have large calves and thighs and knew the XL's would not fit. There is plenty of room for my legs, and come all of the way up to my waist. I have them on now. They are warm and comfy. I will buy them again.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Nice,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Fits very well and almost forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,There's a few places I don't want frostbite...these make a great base layer for the upper 20s to the 50s. Front fly is great for firing position under cover if ya like peeing by just unzipping fly,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Not true to size, run a little small. Order next size up for a good fit",4
B08D2Q4NDZ,"They're warm, durable, and comfortable. The only complaint is that Amazon's AI said they run small, so order 2 sizes larger than normal. Nope. Had to return the first pair. They run how you'd expect. About to order a second pair because I like them a lot now that they fit.",4
B08D2Q4NDZ,Arrived on time and they are perfect! Thanks,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Good quality, arrived on time. I always wear a size large in long underwear and they have always been a tight fit.  These are loose fitting and checked tag they say large, maybe they will shrink.  However, I am not returning as they will work and sure a medium would be too small.  not complaining.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Nice and comfortable.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,They were too long / no shorter size,4

B08D2Q4NDZ,"Just what I needed on these cold,cold days.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Practical and comfortable,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Suggestion from shipper said I should go with a 3xl making me second guess myself and I did order the 3 xl and they are too big for me. Quality is good just be careful and order what u think u need. Would be a 5 star rating if they fit me.,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,Perfect warmer during the Winter and freezing weather,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Perfect ... long enough, not bulky, wash well",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Fits well, keeps the family jewels warm.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,I bought them for my teen since he takes the bus to and from school.  He was surprisingly happy that it kept him warm during our frigid winters in Chicago.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Warm, soft, true to size",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Sizing is accurate; product as expected!,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Ordered these for my husband. Needed new long underwear going into winter.  He tells me that these are very soft feeling and warm.  The weight is not to heavy like some brands.  This is the second order of these.  The first order was returned because the grey pair had the fly sewn shut.,4

B08D2Q4NDZ,Fit great great product thank you.,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,Good,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,This will keep you warm in those cold winter months. I ended up ordering a second set just because it's really good quality.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,good quality,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Great items. Comfortable. Great price.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Satisfied,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Would Buy Again,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Bought these to keep my legs warm riding my e-bike in 40-50 degree weather. I paired it with jeans, and windbreaker pants on top.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,True to size,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Fast shipping.  Nice fit for 6'3 man ..220 lbs,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Ordered these then went to the ubiquitous Wall store and found the same brand and color for almost 1/2 the price. I wondered if I should cancel my order and was unhappy about the disparity in price. When we received these from Amazon they were a better quality and worth the cost. I recommend these if you want a good product.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Way too baggy in the legs. Definitely not true to size. Bought the large because I'm a 36... I have had FTL Long John's in the past and they are not this big. Definitely are not form-fitting to your legs like they should be, like they are shown in the description.But naturally I did not realize this until after I had washed them. So now I I am stuck with them.",3
B08D2Q4NDZ,I like how it fits and is nice and cozy not too big not too small and keeps you nice and warm so I will say the quality and texture and the color this just right and worth every penny no complaints for me,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,"I am sure it said 100% cotton,  and  didn't show more expensive ones too, which is 100% cottonI meant there was not more option for cottonBut You sent 48%polyester, 52% cotton",3
B08D2Q4NDZ,These are soft and well made. Fit is on point elastic waist is not scratchy or cutting but hold well. Price beats other's single pair price. Highly recommend these.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Nice material, comes as described in the photo",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"These are labeled 3XL, but fit much looser than that at the hips and waist, causing me to keep pulling them up if I'm walking or moving around a lot. But they are quite effective at providing warmth. I've worn them under joggers in below freezing temperatures and was fine. If you get these thermals and your measurements are in between sizes, I'd suggest going with the smaller.",3
B08D2Q4NDZ,great thermals for outside activities,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Self,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Fits well and keeps me warm. It works a lot better than I expected. Definitely a must buy for these cold mornings at work.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,I absolutely love them and they are true to size,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Nice and warm,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,"I'm 5'6"" to 5'7"", 130 lbs, male and the smalls fit great, maybe a tiny bit long. Nice layer as colder temps arrive.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,These fit perfectly according to their size chart. These are good bargain for a four pack. Highly recommend.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,These are very comfortable and the keep you warm.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Fits well and are warm.,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Been wearing Fruit Of the Loom for nearly as long as I've been alive - 60 years. Quality is still good even though the are made in a contract factory,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,For a little large after one wash but are warm,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Quality is good after 1 year of use,4
B08D2Q4NDZ,Kinda scratchy. Wish they were more cotton/stretch than the not so soft fabric they are made of. They keep me warm though.,3
B08D2Q4NDZ,"Seems to be a good quality. Longer legs than is common, which is a good thing. Just the right length for a 6'0"" person. Medium warmth.",5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Soft material and warm,5
B08D2Q4NDZ,Sizing was perfect. I use them as pajama pants. Keeps my legs warm.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"I will start by saying I've been wearing the old version of these for a long time and this was my first purchase of the new version with the grey soles. It's a tad annoying that the picture is misleading but overall they are the same sock, I honestly prefer the color contrast.These socks are not made to workout in or made to withstand tons of rough usage. If you are complaining about that you are buying the wrong sock. They are super easy to slide on and are the PERFECT combination of thinness to keep your feet cooler but also thick enough to be very comfortable.These are cheap socks that get the job done and in my opinion are extremely comfortable. I have a drawer full of more expensive socks (looking at you Bomba's and Nike) and find myself putting these on over any other brand EXCEPT WHEN I AM WORKING OUT OR WILL BE WORKING IN THEM ALL DAY.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,My husband loves these socks! I go through his socks on a regular because of holes and these have held up so far!,5
B06ZYMQNGC,Nice padded soles with water wicking to keep my feet dry. I wear a women's size 10W shoe. These socks are plenty big enough for my feet. I like the padding & thick socks in the winter.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,They run small n material is thin I wear a size 12 held against my foot their half the size,4
B06ZYMQNGC,"They stay up,  Wash well, And are comfortable",5
B06ZYMQNGC,Love em.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,Made to last.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"Feel like they changed the material on these, but overall still good.",3
B06ZYMQNGC,"These feel too much like dress socks than sport socks. Very thin material in comparison to the old style and because of that, offer far less cushioning than before. This is a mistake that needs to be amended.",2
B06ZYMQNGC,I like it.  For work.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"We have purchased these Hanes socks in the past at sock stores, so when I saw them on Amazon I thought why not just get them delivered. My other half has not been wearing them that long and he has already thrown out one pair and ready to dispose of another shortly. They are cheesy. The material doesn't wear well at all. Probably will try to find them elsewhere at a store so that we can feel the materials quality or not.",3
B06ZYMQNGC,"Edited:  I've kept my review of the REAL x-temp socks below, however adding this edit and altering my rating after receiving them.  As others have reported, Hanes apparently has changed the design, they now look and feel essentially the same as a different style they've had before that is simply thicker fabric, but put the X-temp logo on them.  All the things from my review are now irrelevant, with the exception of the neck of the sock feels less tight.  So they fixed my one complaint, but literally all the elements that made these socks special is gone, and there's no good reason to have done this.  The socks are solid for what they are, my rating of 2 stars is related to their alternation and slapping the name on them and trying to be reasonable that they're decent, but compared to what they were it should be 1 star.  As socks go, they are good on their own but they are nothing at all like what they have set the expectations on this brand name and have failed their customers by doing this.Finding a 12-pack for only a few dollars more than I'd have paid had I bought them in the store was exceptional.  These socks are remarkable in the sense that they have a brilliant idea to have a thin but reinforced fabric around the toes and a few other areas, while having a slightly tighter fabric around the midsection of the foot for a little bit of extra stability and comfort.  Couple that with cushion in all the places one would want it and this sock allows the foot to breathe without sacrificing durability or comfort.  The only down side at all would be that the neck of the sock is a bit too tight overall for me, which is not an issue I have with other sock brands.  I'm a little heavyset at about 220 as of this writing so they may have been designed with thinner sports-oriented people in mind. That said they are phenomenal workout socks.",2
B06ZYMQNGC,Was looking for cotton socks. Advertised with a high cotton content. Do not feel like cotton and I am unsure as the materials are not listed on the packaging.,3
B06ZYMQNGC,I bought this for my Dad and he loves them. Easy to put on and good quality.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"ive tried washing a dozen times, but if your not size 10-12 these will not fit.",3
B06ZYMQNGC,"I reordered these socks after previously purchasing in August 2022. The old socks look like the picture - black all over except for Hanes text on the toes. The new socks are grey on the bottom and in the heel, which is still visible when wearing dress shoes. I returned these socks because they're not going to work for dress shoe purposes.",3
B06ZYMQNGC,Personal,5
B06ZYMQNGC,The go all the way around my feet and my shoes go on the outside of the socks. It's a perfect plan and yes I was bored.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,Should have bought another pack,4
B06ZYMQNGC,After 1 Wash I have already found two different socks with holes in them,1
B06ZYMQNGC,Terrible quality. Half of the pairs have holes next to the ankles. Threw away two pairs already.,1
B06ZYMQNGC,"Amazing socks. I'm not a conoseur as I was the type to get generic Walmart socks, but these are so much better. Keep my feet comfortable and pretty dry, and they are thin but thick enough to wear both in my tennis shoes and my work boots. I wear timberlands for work and my old socks would have gotten soaked and stinky in an hour before, but these keep my feet nice and my boots from stinking",5
B06ZYMQNGC,These are amazing. They fit perfectly without being too tight and they stay up all day and I never had to fix them or adjust them at all. I have bought numerous packs and love them. 10/10 Recommends,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"I love these socks! Very comfortable, not too fluffy not too thin just perfect.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,"I had originally bought a 6 pack of these socks in a store years ago. When it finally came time to replace them, I found this 12 pack on here. But the socks in the 12 pack are of lower quality. They lose all elasticity as soon as you pull up the socks!Highly disappointed. I would return them, but I threw away all the packaging when I got the socks.NOT WORTH $30!",2
B06ZYMQNGC,The quality is great but the picture is misleading! Not fully black instead it has grey bottoms. Would recommend anyways.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"I like hanes socks I order them often,but this time socks were so much thinner than normal..I am on my feet 10 hours a day I need the thicker padding on socks",3
B06ZYMQNGC,"First time out of the bag - Obviously not much cotton in these. Hard to tell because the packaging doesn't say. Also, they aren't the socks pictured on Amazon. These have a grey toe and sole. I've purchased Hanes products in the past these don't seem to measure up.",1
B06ZYMQNGC,BOUGHT FOR MY SON,4
B06ZYMQNGC,"Eithw rmy feet magically grew or the socks are tiny, about 40% smaller than the same size socks were in 2020.",2
B06ZYMQNGC,"Bought the same socks a year ago, these are half the thickness and cheaper in quality. Shame on you Haynes.",2
B06ZYMQNGC,"Likely my most comfortable socks ever ! Warm, snug-fitting, very good moisture-control. Pad my sensitive old heels well, prevent pain/ inflammation/""plantar fasciitis"" to calcaneus ( heel bone ), if I walk in them a bit without shoes or slippers. These are only socks I wear now : also save wasted time- matching/ pairing of numerous multi-colored/ patterned socks !  Very good price/ value. Have thus far proven highly durable, no apparent wear !",5
B06ZYMQNGC,Great soft socks that don't poke the corner of your toes. Only long socks I wear. Only downside is they are socks so I'll have to keep buying them forever.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"For my son, he likes the fit, comfort, & durability of these socks.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,The socks are okay if you want a very light and thin sock. I was looking for their x temp cushioned socks with reinforced toe and heel. This was not it. They feel a bit cheap. I will keep them and wear them out but I would not purchase again.,2
B06ZYMQNGC,"My feet overheat with any other socks I've tied, (I've tried many!)",5
B06ZYMQNGC,"I like crew socks as I like socks that protect past my ankle. The ones I like most have enough elastic grip to stay there without any vasoconstriction. I purchased these thinking they'd be like other hanes socks that I own, where they're both comfortable and snug--I was wrong. They have a very weak elastic and slide down my legs after light walking (much less a real hike/run/bike ride).",2
B06ZYMQNGC,one of the better socks that i have owned.,4
B06ZYMQNGC,"These used to be my favorite socks. But either the manufacturing process changed, or something... the material feels less dense somehow then my old socks and they don't stay as tight on the calf and feel just ... wrong. Just not the same as before and cheaper. I don't know how to describe it but this is not the same socks as before.",1
B06ZYMQNGC,I love these socks and I been wearing them for years now. I keep coming back. They just work well!,5
B06ZYMQNGC,They work and they're not wearing down in the heel as some other socks I've gotten for my s/o but they don't really work to wick moisture away. And they feel absolutely cheap in comparison to other brands. Semi-regret buying them.,3
B06ZYMQNGC,"I purchased these socks at Target for my husband. He really liked them so much we decided to purchase another pack but, on Amazon. The pack from Amazon was wayyyy better quality than the Target ones. These ones were not constricting like the pack from Target. We ordered another pack because they were better than store bought.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,I bought these thinking I was purchasing the same Over the Calf socks I've had for over three years that are getting thin in the heel. These are much shorter and slip down. If the seller has the over the calf available I am still interested but a search on Amazon I did  not see  Hanes X-temp over the calf.,3
B06ZYMQNGC,I have owned multiple pair of these Hanes socks but these are like a generic version. The upper portion is stretched out and will fall down as the elastic is almost non existent.,2
B06ZYMQNGC,"Let me begin by saying that I have loved these socks in the past and still like them now.  What I do not like is the new, shorter length.  They are about 2"" shorter than my last order and are a bit too short for my boots.  They are nice and comfortable, just too short.",3
B06ZYMQNGC,These are the only socks my husband likes to wear because his feet sweat a lot while working. He loves them,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"Whenever I need socks , I always go to my Amazon.. I can always find what I need.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,These socks fit well and are comfortable but if you wear them with any non-breathable footwear they sweat like crazy.,3
B06ZYMQNGC,I bought the extreme socks at the store before and I really liked them but when I bought it online I was disappointed it was thinner  and they fall down and bunch up in my shoes.,2
B06ZYMQNGC,"My husband has trouble with his feet, wears heavy boots all day in all kinds of weather and is in his feet a lot. He loves these socks. He says they are comfortable and keep his feet dry.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,"So far, so good! Have had these for about a month and no odor from my son's feet. I can finally breath during our car rides again.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,"These black crew socks are very comfortable, but they are a little thinner than previous versions.  I will have to see how they hold up.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,"These socks used to be thicker or so I remember, otherwise a great product",4
B06ZYMQNGC,Attractive enough for the office but comfortable enough for everyday wear around the house. Good thickness for spring and fall wear. Excellent value for the price.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,The socks are not as thick as the ones I bought a few years ago from the box store.  However they are comfortable and warm.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"These socks are the most  comfortable I've ever had.Thick enough to help with fatigue,but not so much that they get hot.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,Comfortable and great fit. Went beyond my expectations and they work as advertised too. Highly recommend,5
B06ZYMQNGC,It was quick to find what I was looking for on Amazon & the quickness was what I like. I havent had any issue with my orders.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"My son loves these socks, they're not too thick, not too thin & are very breathable",5
B06ZYMQNGC,"These are great socks, so I look for them specifically. Make sure you get the X-Temp. One vendor tried to pawn off cheaper, thin socks.",5
B06ZYMQNGC,They are thick and so comfortable. They're the best socks.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,Wore once and falling apart,1
B06ZYMQNGC,Wonderful socks. Still have 10 pairs from two years ago. No holes and I wear them just about every day.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"Fit Great , Last a Long Time , My Every Day Socks , Love Them !!!",5
B06ZYMQNGC,Socks are ok...Thinner material than some previous models.,4
B06ZYMQNGC,These socks aren't what are pictures they aren't solid black,1
B06ZYMQNGC,Very nice,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"super soft, not durable at all, ripped 3 pairs in a week. comfy, but weaker than 1 ply",1
B06ZYMQNGC,These socks are too thin. I bought the exact same socks at target and they are way thicker.,3
B06ZYMQNGC,Very comfortable socks for my work boots.  Second time I ordered these socks.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,Excellent socks hold up well thick and does cut down a lot of the foot smell,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"We were hoping that these socks would be totally black like previous ones we purchased, disappointed in the Grey toes and souls. The quality is excellent!",1
B06ZYMQNGC,GREAT COMFY,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"The elastic at the top was too loose, they kept falling down throughout the day.",1
B06ZYMQNGC,Very comfortable. Sweat control. Worth the value. Very good quantity and quality.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,Best price I have found for these great socks.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,I don't dislike my FreshIQ X-Temp socks.,3
B06ZYMQNGC,"2 sock had holes,to ld amazon and hanes about  i t but they did nothing",3
B06ZYMQNGC,Comfortable. Good quality.,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"Good product, just not thick.",3
B06ZYMQNGC,I like !!!!!!!!!!,5
B06ZYMQNGC,"I ajve worn the xtemp hanes socks for a decade or more. I've received them for Christmas and birthdays and was elated when I unwrapped them. Hanes changed the fabric, and with that, the quality. I could tell just by looking at them that they were no longer my sock of choice. I sent them back, and found a reasonable replacement And1 brand, at Walmart.  I wish they stayed the same.",1
B01KTUK3PM,"This is such a great shirt I ordered two. It runs very large. I usually get an XL cause I like my shirts baggy. Not quite this baggy. I got a tall because I need my shirts to be long. Not pro basketball player long. Before I even asked for an exchange I ordered another L cause I needed it fast. They must have figured out I ordered the wrong size and it came within 1 day. The exchange with the other one in a different colour was smooth and only took three days for the whole thing. Excellent customer service and an amazingly well made product. Soft, beautiful colour, and great fit.  I now have two favourite shirts.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"The quality of this shirt is very strong, is soft and it's not easy to get wrinkles. Worth every penny and it's very good in the cold weather. This elevates the outfit without having to wear a suit. And a lot options for colors. Love the fact that the sizes offer tall as well this is not an option you find in all companies. Will buy it again.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"We ordered the grey in an XL for my 6 ft. 200 lb husband. Fit perfectly !! Nice quality at a great price. He liked it so much we ordered the black. Same great fit & quality. It's not a heavy weight flannel, I'd say a medium weight.I did wash it on cold & hung it to dry as I do with all our shirts. It did not shrink. It probably would be fine not ironed. I did iron it as like the looks of an ironed shirt.Recommend !!!!  if you are looking for a nice shirt at a terrific price.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"I ordered two of these shirts, one gray and one dark green. The fabric used is a good heavy flannel. The fit is very good and the shirts are very comfortable. I have only one complaint regarding the shirts and that's the button holes. I don't think I've had a shirt that so difficult to button and unbutton. It took me nearly 5 mins to get all the buttons undone, a task that should take less than 30 seconds. Getting them re-buttoned was equally difficult. I finally wallowed out some of the button holes with a ball point pen barrel to ease the process. Overall I must recommend the shirt for it's quality of construction, quality of fabric used and fit. Just be prepared for some frustration when it comes to the buttons.",4
B01KTUK3PM,"Was hoping for the price that this would be at least decent and not poorly constructed. Far exceeded all my expectations. Well constructed, fits well, super comfortable. Perfect fo cool to cold days. As a bonus it looks good on. Chose this brand because competing brands appeared to be shorter in length than I like. Ordered a second shirt in different pattern immediately after wearing initial order.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"Ordered this first in a XL tall - it was too big, downsize to a Large Tall. Husband liked it so much, we just ordered two more. The sleeves and body length are great -- Shirt feels like a good quality garment. If you get it out of the dryer quickly, looks good. The corduroy accents are a nice touch. And, the chest pocket is actually a decent size on these! Order away, you won't be disappointed.",5
B01KTUK3PM,One of the best shirt I own. Several people have complemented it or asked where I bought it.  The shirt is both comfortable/soft and slightly dressy. (Casual dressy)  This is great for an over short in  the winter.  Also great for heading out dining at a casual restaurant.  I use it a lot for travel because it is one short that works for both warmth and going out.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"I bought several of these shorts at Christmas... as gifts and for myself. In all cases, they were well constructed and visually pleasing. Also in all cases... they were just a bit smaller than my typical sizing. But, they weren't so small that it would have justified a size up. I think that would have been too large. This was true for my son who normally wears a size L and for me who normally wears a size XLT.",4
B01KTUK3PM,"The materials were nor as good as I thought they would be not bad but at the price I thought they would be better. the cuffs curl at the ends , I have not ironed it so that may help that i don't know. the fit was good so that is why i gave it a 4 star because of the cuffs and the price.",4
B01KTUK3PM,Looks exactly like the web picture. The fabric is thick but soft. The fit is neither loose nor tight. The pattern is classic and low key and matches well with brown leather jacket. I just ordered another one of similar pattern.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Delivery was fast, item is as described. The color is called ""Canyon Plaid"", it should've been called ""Never Lost-in-the Woods Orange"". If you have friends like I do when you wear they're gonna ask you ""whatcha huntin' for today?"" But I digress...The shirt is comfy, looks good, and wasn't expspensive, and I like it no matter what those fools say!",5
B01KTUK3PM,Good quality shacket. It is warm without being stifling or cumbersome.  The item fits as advertised and is an affordable alternative to a higher priced similar item from Lands End. Nice selection of colors.,5
B01KTUK3PM,Its seems size is a bit bigger .Go one size down to have a good fit.,4
B01KTUK3PM,To bad we have to pay so much to stay warm!!! Much much like the real flannel not color blocked only a super small amount of flannel fabric these days and for people that do not understand very much worth your money period!!!!,5
B01KTUK3PM,Ordered this in orange and the color is divine. Fits my son perfectly and is great quality fabric at a great price,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Good shirt overall, well made and comfortable.  Only one problem, I ordered my size and it arrived just a touch to large, but after the first wash it was a bit to small. I can still squeeze into it,  but will never be my favorite shirt.",4
B01KTUK3PM,"I bought a size large, and I washed it in warm water and dried it on a cool cycle... it did shrink a little in the sleeve length. The type of flannel is softer and seems thicker than any flannel shirt I'm used to. I like it. Reasonable price for the quality. I bought a second shirt.",5
B01KTUK3PM,The color is true to the image.  The cuff and collar adds a nice touch and it is good quality.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Same shirt, same age, different color (obviously), the blue one has not been washed yet. I got salad dressing in my gray one. Now I have an expansive flannel shirt for a much smaller person, maybe my wife will want it :)",4
B01KTUK3PM,"I purchase these every year for my husband and sons. They are wonderful quality, fit great and wash well!  You won't be disappointed.",5
B01KTUK3PM,Although Jeff Bezos has a good company but sucks for supporting the dimwitted DJT... the product works for me,4
B01KTUK3PM,"My dad is a small man that usually wears medium in shirts, but I got this in large for him to wear over his other shirts in cooler weather. He absolutely LOVES it and finds it so comfortable. He would have one in every color if he could",5
B01KTUK3PM,100% cotton and will shrink when run thru the dryer. Buy 1 size larger. I wear a Medium and bought large and launder before wearing. FIts perfect. And its a great quality shirt. I now have several of them,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Order size up, for shrinkage. Everything else is good , the fit the quality. Soft , warm , Shrunk noticeably in the dryer. Have to gift it to someone of smaller stature. oh well",4
B01KTUK3PM,Looks good and very comfortable. Got a 2x and it felt like it shrunk down to what a 1x would be after the dryer. Maybe size up.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"I bought my friend one for Christmas and he's worn it several times.  I just bought him another one in a different color.  He really likes the feel, fit &, look with the corduroy on it. A very, very good purchase.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"Great fit , warm and stylish with snap closure and 2 breast pockets . Washed beautifully in cold water . Highly recommend this shirt.",5
B01KTUK3PM,Very soft. A perfect fit. Muted colors that go well with khaki pants. Handsome. The only downside: a stiff collar.,4
B01KTUK3PM,Nice midweight flannel comfortable and true to size. Was a gift and they love it!!,5
B01KTUK3PM,Fits perfect and quality shirt for the price.,4
B01KTUK3PM,"I think I own four or five of them. Easy care, comfortable, looks good, sizing is perfect! And they come in all sorts of different colors choices. Great addition to the wardrobe.",5
B01KTUK3PM,Husband loved it.  Good looking shirt.  Warm beyond my expectations.  Why not 5 stars you ask.Because it pills up terribly and then drops tiny black balls on the rest of your clothes.,4
B01KTUK3PM,"Fits, feels great, soft, very little cold wash shrinkage. This is becoming one of my faves! Looks great on me says my wife.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"First of all, I am a woman but I buy men's 2XL flannel shirts to go over my substantial hips. I wear them as a tunic over my clothes around my home to provide additional warmth. This is a very nice medium weight flannel which has corduroy lining around the inside of the neck as well as the cuffs. I love orange and was happy to find this beautiful plaid. It has washed up beautifully without any shrinkage.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"Nice shirt, get lots of compliments. Comfortable materials.",4
B01KTUK3PM,Great grab n go for chilly days.,4
B01KTUK3PM,"Great quality, great looking on my husband! He says the material is comfortable.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"I normally purchase L shirts (17x32) and when 42R off the rack. Out of the package, the shirt was a bit stiff and seemed large.  After a wash and dryer, the shirt shrunk down to a proper fit. It seems comfortable, we'll see about the durability. The material is NOT as heavy as my old favorite LLBean chamois shirt which lasted 15 years, but hope this will last 10. Color seems fast- no significant fading after 1 wash.",5
B01KTUK3PM,"Planning a trip to Pennsilvania in January and this shirt will be perfect. Warm, fits perfectly, great fabric, and looks good. Has room for a Tshirt underneath.Would definitely recommend.",5
B01KTUK3PM,love the shirt! they waited until the delivery day to ship it. 20 days and then delivered the next day,5
B01KTUK3PM,I ordered 2 of this same shirt on super sale. I ordered 2 of a different color a few weeks back and am quite pleased with this brand from this vendor. The plaid material patterns are closely matched left side to right side. Extra high quality details throughout. The corduroy inlays in the cuffs and neck are nice. Material is a medium weight.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"This was a Christmas gift for my brother. He loved it! He said it fit his size well, was warm, the colors www vibrant, fabric had just the right amount of thickness. He was able to wear shirt open over T-shirt for layers. The shirt was well worth the price.",5
B01KTUK3PM,So soft. True to size.  My man really likes it.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Nice quality shirt, nice fabric.",4
B01KTUK3PM,"This is a great shirt, but a little snug. I would order up.",4
B01KTUK3PM,We bought this for our son in law for Christmas. He has a few from this brand. He really loved this and has worn it several times already.,5
B01KTUK3PM,Great quality and very comfortable.  Thick but super soft.,5
B01KTUK3PM,I bought this shirt for my husband to wear to a Christmas party. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. It is not like regular flannel. I wish the corduroy linings went through out the whole sleeve. It is only the cuff so if you are planning on rolling your sleeves you wont see it. It isn't overly hot but it is great for layering if you are planning on being outside.,4
B01KTUK3PM,"I found these flannels about 2 years ago, and I gifted them to both my dad and my husband. Ever since , my entire family has grown to love these, including my uncle and cousins! According to the guys, they are comfortable and they last a long long time without pilling or noticeable wear. Got more this Christmas!",5
B01KTUK3PM,"This flannel is very comfortable and well designed, particularly the corduroy in the cuffs and collar which makes the design stand out. I do have some early concerns about the long term durability of the shirt given a lot of loose threads right out of the box. Time will tell I suppose",4
B01KTUK3PM,Got this for my brother for his birthday present.  Nice color and fit.  He liked it,5
B01KTUK3PM,"100% Cotton; Cool and breezy in the Summer; Warm and tucked in for the Winter. Wash Cold, little to no detergent. Air Dry setting for Drying.",5
B01KTUK3PM,easy to wash. No ironing. Easy upkeep. Pretty much what you want in this type of shirt.,5
B01KTUK3PM,I purchased 3 of these shirts for my sons Xmas present they all loved them especially the softness and a lighter weight flannel. I had to come back and get another for my hubby. All sons are very tall and these fit perfectly.,5
B01KTUK3PM,I have ordered 3 more because of the quality,5
B01KTUK3PM,I have these in several patterns. At 6'0 the Large shrank too much for me; the Large Big & Tall is perfect.,4
B01KTUK3PM,Looks great. Good fit. Runs true to size.,5
B01KTUK3PM,Color great warmth was good worth the money,5
B01KTUK3PM,A+ great sharp looking shirt!Bought for a gift last year and was asked to get another one this year for Christmas in a different color!,5
B01KTUK3PM,Shirt is warm enough to not wear jacket,5
B01KTUK3PM,This was amazing quality for the price.,5
B01KTUK3PM,"The quality is perfect, but the sizing is in question.  At 5'8"" 175lbs, I wear a medium in everything.  I'm not overweight or anything but this shirt, though perfect in body length and arm length, was uncomfortably tight across the chest (though not tight over the stomach).I still think it is a great shirt and will probably order the large to see if it's better.",4
B01KTUK3PM,Very nice fabric!  It was a happily received gift for my other half!,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Good quality, comfortable and good price.",5
B01KTUK3PM,Outdoor wear appropriate for outdoor guy,5
B01KTUK3PM,Very nice shirt. Will buy this brand again,5
B01KTUK3PM,help keep you warm flannel shirt,5
B01KTUK3PM,Decided not to return sorry for inconvenience,5
B01KTUK3PM,Great shirt especially for the price!,5
B01KTUK3PM,"Very comfortable,  high quality",5
B01KTUK3PM,Great shirt well made .,5
B01KTUK3PM,Girlfriend loves this shirt !,5
B01KTUK3PM,"la camisa genial, recomendada",5
B07NNTCV5K,What a price! These socks are made well and last my husband a long time because they are made so soft and thick.,5
B07NNTCV5K,"I recently bought a pack of Puma socks, and they are fantastic! The quality is top-notch, and they fit perfectly, even with my size 13 feet. The material feels durable and soft, providing great comfort throughout the day. I was worried they might be too tight, but they stretch just the right amount and stay in place without slipping. Whether I'm working out or just going about my day, these socks offer the perfect blend of support and breathability. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and highly recommend Puma socks to anyone looking for high-quality, comfortable socks that fit larger feet perfectly.",5
B07NNTCV5K,Nice socks can't wait to start playing golf again they feel good and work well with the golf shoes.,5
B07NNTCV5K,I've been reordering these a couple times a year and love them compared to all the others i've tried. it's a good thickness and is comfortable but the only down side (reason it didn't get 5 stars) is because it wears holes in the bottom pretty quickly. Probably doesn't help i'm on the large end of what feet size this is for.,4
B07NNTCV5K,Great fit,5
B07NNTCV5K,Good quality and very comfortable. Very recommended!,5
B07NNTCV5K,For the last 8 years Puma is the only socks I buy they last for 2 or 3 years very good quality will not buy any other brand,5
B07NNTCV5K,"I will continue to buy these socks.  They last a long time, good thickness, breathable and they are great for everyday wear.  Puma is a great brand.",5
B07NNTCV5K,Great stocking stuffer!,5
B07NNTCV5K,"Can never have too many good pairs of socks. If you are wondering if you should get these, GET 2 PACKS!",5
B07NNTCV5K,"No matter what they say, even the larger size posted for these socks is a little smaller than regular socks I can buy in my size.  These are a bit smaller than I thought I would get.  Well made and should last, but be aware they could be about one size smaller",4
B07NNTCV5K,These are good for the price. A little thinner than I expected but they're nice.,4
B07NNTCV5K,"I use these for workout. When you first put them on, it feels like a band along heel. I just adjust the sock and it works out ok. I do not feel it after I adjust the socks. It is strange feel but it works out ok for me",4
B07NNTCV5K,"These are awesome!  Super comfortable and fit perfectly. I will definitely be getting more of these. I am a size 11 US so sometimes socks will be pretty tight even though they say up to size 12, but these are pefect.  I would highly recommend",5
B07NNTCV5K,"Very happy with these socks. Soft, comfortable, and are holding up well with usage and laundering.",5
B07NNTCV5K,"Quality has stayed the same over the years. A rarity today.My feet stay fresh, I own so many socks..",5
B07NNTCV5K,"Son only wears these, to class to gym to frat. Can't be better!",5
B07NNTCV5K,Husband loves these socks!,5
B07NNTCV5K,Good quality and comfortable,5
B07NNTCV5K,"Bello acabado, se ven originales y el precio es excelente",5
B07NNTCV5K,A tiempo para regalo,5
B07NNTCV5K,"TL;DR: The ultimate survivalist socks for the teenage tornadoes - durable, stain-proof, and charity-ready.In the tempestuous whirlwind of teenage life, where every item of clothing is a casualty waiting to happen, emerges a beacon of hope - the Socks of Fortitude. Designed not merely as foot coverings but as armors against the ruthless onslaught of athletic endeavors and the insidious creep of growth spurts, these socks have stood the test of time and turmoil.Purchased over a year ago for my spirited teenage sons, who treat their wardrobe with the same gentle care as a hurricane treats a coastline, these black knights of the sock drawer have finally met their match, not in wear and tear, but in the noble battle against the inevitable rise of their owners' feet. The choice of color, a deep, forgiving black, serves as a cloak of invisibility against the stains that often besmirch lesser socks, rendering them not just wearable but pristine through countless adventures.Breathability and lightweight design are the cherries on top of this robust confection, ensuring comfort in motion and rest alike. Yet, it's the reinforced stitching and strategic fabric reinforcement in areas most susceptible to wear that elevate these socks from mere clothing to trusted companions. Through soccer matches, track meets, and the daily grind of teenage life, they've emerged victorious, a testament to their unparalleled durability.In an ultimate act of heroism, last year's battalion of socks, rather than being discarded, found new purpose in the hands of a less fortunate family. This transition not only underscores their lasting quality but also the spirit of generosity they inspire.For parents navigating the stormy seas of teenage upbringing, or for any soul in search of footgear that combines resilience with comfort and a touch of philanthropy, these socks are a beacon of hope. I herald them not just as highly recommended but as essential allies in the quest for durable, high-quality socks.",5
B07NNTCV5K,Low cut fit perfect good quality,5
B07NNTCV5K,"Decided to wait a bit before posting this review, so I could run through the washer and also get some good workouts in. These socks are holding up well. I will definitely buy again!",5
B07NNTCV5K,Love them,5
B07NNTCV5K,"The socks are thick and stretchy, nice design and bright in color.",5
B07NNTCV5K,These definitely aren't thick socks. I got these and was hoping for a good sock .. in return.. I got very thin short socks .. that were nothing like described..,4
B07NNTCV5K,Very good durable. Fast shipping,5
B07NNTCV5K,There actually comfortable on your feet no digging in like some socks especially at seams,5
B07NNTCV5K,Easy to put on. Great grip. Slip Resistant and looks soft and thick.,4
B07NNTCV5K,"After a while of telling me I needed new socks, my fiance finally convinced me to buy new ones. I saw Puma and I thought the description and price matched what I was looking for conveniently.The socks are comfortable and easy to slip on with ease and they make walking less hard on the feet.Here is the issue I have with the socks. All the socks are brought in pairs, with one plastic wire keeping the two socks together. These wires are T shaped and while you could use scissors to cut them out, you can not take them out without making a small hole in the sock.Overall, the product is worth a purchase if you're in need of convenient, well priced socks. Just be wary of the wire.",4
B07NNTCV5K,I wear size 11 shoes and these socks fits me perfectly and are very comfortable. I will always buy the socks.,5
B07NNTCV5K,Just make sure to buy a high quality shoe that won't rub the skin on the back of your foot! Get your foot size right if you want to wear these comfortable no-show socks!,5
B07NNTCV5K,Great buy,5
B07NNTCV5K,My only complaint is the gray set stretches out much faster then the other pair of socks.,4
B07NNTCV5K,I bought theses for everyday use an I love them,5
B07NNTCV5K,"Nice design with a very comfortable fit. These socks stay in position whether wearing slides, street shoes or slip on boots.",5
B07NNTCV5K,"Bien producto, buena calidad y excelente servicio",5
B07NNTCV5K,Thick enough to keep feet warm and wear through too fast when wearing shoes unlike some others,5
B07NNTCV5K,These are normal comfortable socks.,5
B07NNTCV5K,Comfortable,4
B07NNTCV5K,These have been good socks for the price. They fit well they shape to my foot  and they are not expensive,4
B07NNTCV5K,Fit my fiance with no issues!!,5
B07NNTCV5K,For the price we are keeping them and giving them to another family member.  Order up a size for sure maybe 2.  There was a hole in 1 sock but again the price was good so we are keeping them.,4
B07NNTCV5K,Best socks around,5
B07NNTCV5K,Excellent product,5
B07NNTCV5K,I'd hoped they would be thicker but are comfortable.,4
B07NNTCV5K,"Would definitely recommend! Bought these for my husband and he loves these! Says they are so comfy and warm. Amazing quality, I even want to get me some as well.",5
B07NNTCV5K,I like the colors. Hate that the sides keep ripping when I put them on.,3
B07NNTCV5K,The material is good quality with good foot cushion.  Good for snakes or without shoes at home. No shrinkage when washed.  Glad I picked them.,5
B07NNTCV5K,Socks fit good .,5
B07NNTCV5K,"Nothing like putting on new socks, nothing worse than single socks that never have a buddy. Sadly Puma changes their design a little so you still end up with single lonely socks, but if its close enough I use it.pretty durable, I don't get holes often.",5
B07NNTCV5K,Bought these for my fiance because he only wears puma socks. Since I have known him he has not worn another brand. He said he loved these low cut socks (and he usually only wears ankle socks)I have seen him wear the lows more now.,5
B07NNTCV5K,For those who are challenged about figuring out the sizing for socks and shoes don't stick to a simplistic understanding. Shoe size and sock size are not the same thing nor the same number.The information in this listing is clear. Sock size 10-13 is for those who wear shoe size 6-12. It says so right on the red band that holds the pairs of socks that I received. They fit perfectly right now. I expect them to shrink a little after washing following the washing instructions. Warm wash (not hot but under 105 F) and tumble dry low temp. If you wash them at warmer than 105 F then they will definitely shrink... a lot. Same if you dry them at medium or high temp. Durability remains to be tested so if that is less than expected I will update this review. I have had Puma tube socks that have lasted for several years of wearing almost everyday and these are no different in construction. Same loose threads for the logos on the inside which have no affect on using them when I roll them on (as I do any pair of socks).,5
B07NNTCV5K,Stretch and durable,5
B07NNTCV5K,Comfortable and great quality!,5
B07NNTCV5K,Very nice socks!! I wear them all the time!!,5
B07NNTCV5K,comfy socks,5
B07NNTCV5K,Good socks. Better than reebok but just socks,4
B07NNTCV5K,"There were many conflicting reviews, but I decided to try these since the price was reasonable. The set I received were thinner material and stretchy. I wasn't looking for bulky socks, so I liked that aspect. I wear a men's size 10 wide shoe. A lot of socks are too narrow, and squeeze my feet. These do not. They ate very comfortable and breathable. One issue for some may be the amount of threads in the heel cup area. They don't add bulging or discomfort, but I have to be mindful to roll them a bit when putting them on so that my toes enter towards the middle of the sock. Otherwise, my toes catch on those threads.  Also, the packaging is a little cumbersome. They put way to many of those annoying little nylon tabs that have to be removed carefully so the socks do not snag. Aside from that, I love these socks.",5
B07NNTCV5K,It takes a bit to get used to short top socks but once you do they feel fine.,5
B07NNTCV5K,These fit really well. They almost feel as if you aren't wearing them they are that comfortable.,5
B07NNTCV5K,Great cheap socks that are versatile. Only issue is that they don't hold up well; they consistently develop holes at the heel after just a few months.,4
B07NNTCV5K,I have worn Starter socks for years now and was glad to find these. Will be ordering more in the future. I wear these most days of each week. They are comfortable and have been very durable over the years.,5
B07NNTCV5K,My entire fleet is filled with these now. Great product.,5
B07NNTCV5K,Perfect short socks I use them every day,5
B07NNTCV5K,Just likes. Very good for work.,4
B07NNTCV5K,"I was in need of new socks and wanted to try low cut socks and let me just say these socks are perfect.They come in an 8 pack with slightly different colors with a overall black tone and so they fight any outfit.The socks are soft and comfortable and super clean, they fit my feet just right.5/5.",5
B07NNTCV5K,"They are super soft, fit well (10.5 US) and are tall enough to just clear the tongue of my workout shoes. They are snug, but not super tight like some of my other compression socks. They've got a little breathing square right on top of the toes. I wear them for working out, walking around the house, pretty much everything except for boots.",5
B07NNTCV5K,my son wears a size 13 shoe. It is hard to find his size of socks. He likes these a lot. They stay put and are comfortable.,5
B07NNTCV5K,"For me, I like them. I only gave them a 4 out of five starts because I think they run small for what they are marked. I also see that some people have complained that they only got 4 pairs, not 8. But, I got 8 pairs in the pack, so, not sure about that. That is as expected. They seem to be made well, but we will see in time how they last. I am pretty rough on socks. But out of the bag, they are comfortable. However, that said, they claim they fit size 10-13. I wear a size 11.5-12 shoe (depending on shoe), and they seem to fit snuggly on my feet. I think they fit, I prefer them to fit snug myself, but If I happed to have size 13, I don't think I would be able to get my foot in them. Just sayin, so take that in consideration. I think they run a little small for the size they show.",4
B07NNTCV5K,"The socks are extremely comfortable and feel like could on your feet. If you wear shoes that have foam support in them, then you know your feet are thanking you right now.",5
B07NNTCV5K,Great fit very comfortable with no ankle slides. Nice quality at a nice price,5
B07NNTCV5K,"Eight pairs for 11 bucks was a deal I couldn't turn down.  Socks are very comfy, not too bulky or too thin. Not sure how durable they will be - one or two wearings shows that they might not last too long but at this price, who cares.  I like the level of arch support - my arches are flat and any support above minimal gives me painful cramps - these socks are snug around the arches but not too tight or compressive, so very comfortable for my feet.  Even if I only get half a dozen wearings from each pair, the value is very good.",4
B07NNTCV5K,"I have to be honest, my socks wear out fast, but these seem to be more stable than the others I have.  I love the low cut design,  I gave up crew socks except for situations with more formal dress code.",5
B07NNTCV5K,As ordered,4
B07NNTCV5K,"I have the puma women's socks and I love them, so when my bf asked for ""regular socks"" for Christmas, I jumped at the opportunity to get him these. He insisted he didn't need anything special, but I asked him how he liked these and he said he really likes them and they're so comfortable.They hug your feet but are lightweight, and they don't seem to lose their elasticity.",5
B07NNTCV5K,I wear a size 11 shoe and the 10-13 runs very small having to reorder the big & large to get a fit-beware!,2
B07NNTCV5K,Decent socks. They held up fairly well. The elasticity it a little loose on the ankles over time though.,4
B07NNTCV5K,Comfortable. Not too thick or thin. No uncomfortable seems. Good fit. They don't slide down into shoes. Good quality. Saving these in my cart to order again.,5
B07NNTCV5K,"I like the fit and feel of these socks a lot. They are comfortable and cool when working out. I do a lot of active workouts and have noticed a little thinning of some of the padding around the ball of the foot. There aren't any holes after 3 months, but I'm worried that they won't last much longer.",4
B07NNTCV5K,Very comfy,5
B07NNTCV5K,Puma socks never disappoint.well made with great fit . They have fabulous moisture wicking and are extremely comfortable. Would definitely buy again.,5
B07NNTCV5K,My son hates no show socks because they ride down but these are the perfect height that just barely show. Excellent sock for washing wear as well.,5
B07NNTCV5K,Will buy more,5
B07NNTCV5K,"I don't love wearing socks when I'm home, but these are very comfortable. They are easy to take on and off. They are also very soft.",5
B07NNTCV5K,Fits well,3
B071ZZBZRD,"I was so happy to get these! Sometimes, the lower portion of my legs and ankles will swell. I spend a lot of time on my feet. These go up just below my knee. I've noticed a huge difference in my legs swelling. The compression helps with that it's impressive.  They're quite breathable and are comfortable for all day use. Easy to out on, and quite stylish. They're also quite durable.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"I am loving these socks.They have improved the circulation to my legs, stopped my restless legs, and are even comfortable to sleep in. And the price is so affordable! I will definitely continue to purchases these socks.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"Made well, great fit, impressive results with regular use.  I had resisted compression stockings for years as my hands and nails were inhibiting factors (lack of strength, flimsy fingernails that made the whole ""donning"" process painful).  My husband has been wearing these same stockings for years upon recommendation from his physician for lower calf and ankle swelling. He has terrible osteoarthritis in his hands and has been using a ""sock stretcher"" donner device (from Amazon and others) for years with these stockings with great success.  I finally buckled and learned to properly use the sock stretcher (simple, amazing, why did I wait so long??) with a pair of his socks and had immediate improvement/relief with swelling and painful veins in my lower calf.  Actually looking forward to that next long drive and avoiding the days of leg and ankle swelling afterwards! Love the wide selection of colors/designs!",5
B071ZZBZRD,"Decent quality light compression socks. They hold their compression for well over a year, are quite easy to put on, and are comfortable. The price is right for the quality!",4
B071ZZBZRD,"These socks are excellent! They fit like a dream, stay up without adjusting,  are smooth, + have toe room. I will buy the natural color now that I know.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"Very good, nice variety of colors. They work very well. Comfortable.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"I have bought several pair of compression socks on Amazon and all were to tight at the top of the calf leaving a reddened circle on the calf plus difficult to get on and bunching up when putting them on.These socks are great.  I'm a big guy 6'1"" 240 pounds.  These socks don't bunch up putting them on and do not get to tight at the top of the calf.  I would definitely buy again.The toes are a little snug but they are new and stretching the toe area eliminates the smugness.  Also, they are slick on my hardwood floors so be careful.Highly recommend.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"I bought these on July 2023. I work in a warehouse walking 20-25k  steps 10 hours 4-5 days a week. During first couples of months, the  socks were fine but as time kept passing they would slowly start breaking  especially in the heel area and I have been throwing them away as they have been breaking and I am down to 2 of the 8 pairs I purchased. Maybe it could work better for running not sure but for working in a warehouse not so much.",3
B071ZZBZRD,"This is my second time to purchase and was reasonably pleased with the first purchase.  The previous purchase was 4-5 years ago, and the elasticity seemed to be deteriorating.  It seems to help the circulation in my lower legs and no complaints up to this point.",4
B071ZZBZRD,Great socks and the best deal in the world. I have  not idea why they are so reasonably priced. I bought the same socks a few years ago and they lasted for years.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"Ive been rocking back and forth for over a week with leg pain. No health issues at all but tons of activity on my new job. Standing snd walking for 10+ hours.I ordered these after searching due to a friend mentioning circulation. I put them on and  normally by 7pm im in pain. When i tell you i haven't felt a THING! My toes arent tingling, my legs are feeling 100%. Its been 4 days and my only problem now is i cant wear them everyday! But i havent woke up with any ache or pain. I love these!",5
B071ZZBZRD,"I bought these on a whim, I usually buy Gold Toe. Lately the gold toe were wearing out at the heal after four washings or so. These socks stay up and are superior to the ones I use, I even bought a second set. Buy them!!",5
B071ZZBZRD,I would buy these socks again. The socks fit well all day long.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"I wear these under my tall boots for equestrian.  The quality is as good or better than socks that are made specifically for equestrians.  The socks are about 1/2"" taller than I need (I'm 5'4""), so sometimes I roll them down so they don't stick out the top of my boots.  The socks have held up well through many, many washes.  Great value.",5
B071ZZBZRD,Have ordered thee several times before and they fit well and do the job needed.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"I've been looking for a good sock that goes over the calf almost to the knee, having a larger calf makes it difficult, these check all the boxes, they fit really good, stretchy, and go up just below the knee, also great support without major squeeze",5
B071ZZBZRD,"Seem to be made well enough and were comfortable.They did not work to help alleviate my Restless Leg symptoms,but that is no fault of the product.",4
B071ZZBZRD,Its hard for me to find high socks that go up to my knees so I was a little skeptical about the fit but the socks are just as described.,5
B071ZZBZRD,These are my 1st ever compression socks and I love them.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"Very comfortable, and not too tight. A little snug on the toes, but overall, I am satisfied and would recommend.",5
B071ZZBZRD,I'm 67 just started getting vericos veins in one leg so a friend suggested getting these and I LOVE THEM ! Very comfortable and not expensive. Wish I knew how comfortable they were and would've gotten them 10 years ago. One of my all time favs off Amazon,5
B071ZZBZRD,These compression socks really help with the pain in my calfs McDonald's you'll get more than you expect all day everyday like a buy one at one,5
B071ZZBZRD,"Can wash in washing machine, let air dry. DO NOT put them in the dryer.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"My wife told me about compression socks. I said, Yeah, yeah!"" After wearing them, I'm surprized how much they help! Try them & you will be surprised.",5
B071ZZBZRD,Durable compression socks,4
B071ZZBZRD,"As a nurse I highly recommend these support socks, keeps legs supported on long days.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"Half the socks are physically shorter than the others. It wasn't the internal sock for some of them, it seems mostly random which ones aren't quite long enough. It's more of an annoyance than anything.They work well enough for raising blood pressure a bit, though my circulation is so low it's not enough to alleviate symptoms very much.",4
B071ZZBZRD,"Socks are very comfortable! End of day, reduced fatigue.",4
B071ZZBZRD,The heels of the socks start getting holes in about 6 to 8 months. So I just buy new ones.,4
B071ZZBZRD,"They are helpful,  love them..",5
B071ZZBZRD,Delivery was received on the date promised.  Easy transaction!  Product was as advertised.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Good gentle support,5
B071ZZBZRD,"Not uncomfortable, seem ok",4
B071ZZBZRD,Got these for when I travel very comfortable. shared some with my daughter for when she travels. I would purchase them again.,5

B071ZZBZRD,My compression socks are so comfortable.,4
B071ZZBZRD,I have bought this product several times over the past few years.,5
B071ZZBZRD,The fit was good and happy with the purchase.,5
B071ZZBZRD,The socks are really making a difference. So far they are holding up very well and the support works.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Socks are lightweight - not thick or heavy. Fit well. They do not slide down. Do the job well.,5
B071ZZBZRD,I'm on my feet all day. These supportive socks make my legs feel great even after a long day!,5
B071ZZBZRD,Great price and DH is satisfied with performance!,5
B071ZZBZRD,Went on easily without having to tug to pull up. Nice compression.,5
B071ZZBZRD,I've tried several types of compression socks and these are the best without damaging my skin.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Heel holes appear after a few months.,4
B071ZZBZRD,I tried other compression socks but they were way too tight. These are very comfortable. They make your legs feel stable while walking. Highly recommend.,5
B071ZZBZRD,I've used this type and brand since having cellulitis in the R leg and they have been very reliable and tough for what I put them through.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"I bought these to start replacing my older set of socks. These are comfortable, easy to put on and have slight compression for extra comfort. The weight is perfect, not too thick as they fit well within my shoes.",5
B071ZZBZRD,Toes to knees. Very comfortable and snug. Not too tight. I like the different compression in the foot areas.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Have tried a number of these and they're always too long.  These come closer to my foot size and therefore I don't have a bunch of socks bunched up at the end of my shoes.  Try These!,5
B071ZZBZRD,Good product.  Needs to include washing and care instructions.,4
B071ZZBZRD,They fit well. The compression is moderate. I would definitely recommend!,4
B071ZZBZRD,"Perfect,Fast shipping and the socks are a perfect fit! Definitely recommend!",5

B071ZZBZRD,"very comfortable and not as tight as some i have bought before,true to size",5

B071ZZBZRD,Seems to be quality product.  Fits very well.Fast shipping.,5
B071ZZBZRD,By just looking at them I didn't think they were going to work. I'm surprised at how much support they give without being difficult to pull up. Very Happy with this purchase.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Doctors orders,5
B071ZZBZRD,There awesome,5
B071ZZBZRD,Liked,5
B071ZZBZRD,"As a medical professional, I purchased these for my favor. He suffers from bilateral lower extremity weakness. What does that mean? Basically his legs are not as strong as they used to be. My father is 70 and this is to be expected. I purchased these sox in order to provide an increase in vascular resistance to enhance the return of blood flow to his heart. This will improve circulatory oxygenation and thereby enhance lower extremity strength. These are the second set of compression sox I have purchased for my father and he states his leg strength has improved and he feels less fatigued when going for his walks. Bye them they work. I advocate for anyone who is on their feet, and or exercising to use compression sox. They provide a cardiovascular value to your body.",5
B071ZZBZRD,"These feel good and fit well. I used them for international flights as I am sitting for 10+ hours. Even after washing them, they hold their resistance well.",5
B071ZZBZRD,These socks fit very well and are well made. Material is thicker and stronger than most compression socks.,5
B071ZZBZRD,easy to put on,5
B071ZZBZRD,I was having swelling in my legs and ankles and my Dr. suggested compression socks. The Iseasoo socks works good for the swelling.,5
B071ZZBZRD,My husband had bought some from Walmart and they never fit so he ordered them from Amazon and they fit great. Thanks,5
B071ZZBZRD,Only issue is the heels wear out sooner then they should,4
B071ZZBZRD,"I AM A 77 YR OLD TYPE 2 DIABETICWITH DVT IN LEFT LEG,I WEAR COMPRESSION SOCKS.USUALLY PAY15TO20$ pr.these were 8 pr for $20.56 inc tax.little over 2$ pr.they fit like gloves and feel wonderful.my wife has to put them on for me.I can't bend like I could,she was happy and had less problem than usual,with Dr Scholls,when I first opened the pkg.the socks appeared to be for someone with size 6 I need size12. I ordered size L/XL,(to good to be true for fit,feel looks.I can't comment on wear ,tear,resilience,durability need to try out for month or so.they fit to just below knee have not slipped at all still hold at orig pos .even after sleeping in them.have worn for 3 days except for removing for showers.still holding perfect shape  no signs of stretching. try them, you will be as surprised as I am,(Price) I already have my money's worth in one pair. Appears that ,(too good to be true), sometimes (IS) Mitch D",5
B071ZZBZRD,"I've had these socks for about 3 months, and they're already starting to wear in through the toes and the hill. I thought they were built a little bit better than that. They do fit well.But not happy with the way they are falling apart so quickly.",3
B071ZZBZRD,These compression socks have the right pressure and length. They are the best that I have owned.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Absolutely amazing exactly what I needed I definitely recommend them,5
B071ZZBZRD,Great product,5
B071ZZBZRD,I tried several different brands and compression strength. These finally were easier to get on and off. The price is fair for as many socks as you get. I got the neutral colors. I am pleased with these and would recommend.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"Nice fit, and not real thick, so can use for dress up!",5
B071ZZBZRD,"They are inexpensive and do the job. Only negative is their life is less than expected, getting holes in toe or heel. But at the price, it is a good trade off. I can just order more.",4
B071ZZBZRD,They are very comfortable,5
B071ZZBZRD,These socks really do make a difference and at a great price. Would defiantly recommend.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"This bargain brand leaves you wanting more compression. If you have a size 10.5 U.S. or higher shoe size, these will work best. Below that and they'll feel like really high dress socks. I've used them for weight training and cycling. There's a slight notable effect.",4
B071ZZBZRD,Hope they will last.,5
B071ZZBZRD,"My second order of these and they are great and very comfortable, I enjoy wearing them.",5
B071ZZBZRD,Works great to reduce fatigue.,5
B071ZZBZRD,I can get them on and off myself. Feel good all day.,5
B071ZZBZRD,Loved all the different patterns of the socks,5
B071ZZBZRD,My legs don't hurt at the end of the day!,5
B071ZZBZRD,"Really like these socks beyond the quantity and good price - comfort matters with compression socks and so does length to me, as a taller person.As soon as I started using these compared to other brands that look similar, the compression aspect worked better and the sock fit goes almost to my knee bend as desired. Important to me as someone with a size 13 foot and who is 6-1 height. No more tugging and pulling on the socks to keep them high up my leg.Highly recommend this knee high version as it really aligns to the stated description and is very comfortable.",5
B071ZZBZRD,I try other brands/styles and continue to go back to this one. been wearing them for YEARS!,5
B071ZZBZRD,Great fit and price,5
B07DF4CYSR,"I purchased this shirt to wear at night because we keep our bedroom cool.  Wearing this with a sweatshirt keeps me very comfortable when the room is at 63 degrees Fahrenheit.  Well-made, nice material, and light weight.  My size is between a medium and large, so I ordered the large because other reviewers noted that the sizes tended to be on the small size.  It fit like a charm, and I have ordered another one.",5
B07DF4CYSR,I was worried about the material being itchy like other thermals but I found the inside of the shirt to be coated with a very soft material and its in no way itchy . I actually ordered a total of three shirts in 2 days after the inital order. The only drawback is the run a lil small so if you are in between sizes go up to the larger size. I normally wear a M but i could have ordered a L . Other than that they will stretch to fit .,5
B07DF4CYSR,"Size guideline was accurate. Washes well.The shirt is a good thermal base layer, and comfortable by itself in warm conditions. The neck opening is slightly larger than a typical crew style shirt.",5
B07DF4CYSR,This is definitely a nice and warm turtle neck that keeps it shape along with being form fitting. The material is descent and does its job.,4
B07DF4CYSR,"This is an excellent top. The material has just the right feel and weight to it -- not too thick or thin, not too hot or cool, stretchy but not overly so. The stitching is flawless as far as I can tell. A bit on the slender side -- size large fits snugly and I'm only 5'9"" 165 lbs. Extremely comfortable and the price is definitely right. Highly recommended.",5
B07DF4CYSR,"Wasn't expecting much for the price but gave it a shot based on reviews. Ended up being a great thermal base layer. It's definitely on the lighter side, but was actually exactly what I was looking for. Not too compressive, and fits perfectly. We'll see how it holds up over time, but seems like a great value.",5
B07DF4CYSR,"My Husband loves these thermal shirts. He is a big man, and these shirts fit cozy (compression like) and warm. Very soft on the inside also. He wears them as a warm under layer.",5
B07DF4CYSR,"I ordered this for bicycle riding in the cold. When riding at temperatures in the 40s, I usually have to wear about 4 layers of t-shirts under a thick cycling jersey, even though the jersey has an inner lining. With this thermal shirt, I can wear one other base layer and a fleece-lined jacket, and my torso is warm. It is comfortable, and the turtleneck helps even more with keeping me warm. I liked it so much that I ordered another one in a different color. BTW, I did listen to the advice of others and sized up. I usually wear a large shirt, but I ordered this in XL, and it was just the right size for me, as I am 6 feet tall, 195 pounds, and I have a long torso.",5
B07DF4CYSR,"Didn't shrink on laundering. I am not sure how they will hold their shape as material is thin, but they are what I needed and time,as is said, will tell.Would and probably will purchase againSize was Spotify on",5
B07DF4CYSR,"We went skiing and bought this at the last minute.  My husband had left his ski stuff at home.  This was a great price, warm, and nice fitting.  We'd buy again.",5
B07DF4CYSR,This was a tight fit.  Very small for size stated.,4
B07DF4CYSR,This shirt works perfectly for what I needed.  Just wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear underneath for real cold days.  I also will use it as a base layer for when I run in cold weather.  Nice quality and heartily recommend.,5

B07DF4CYSR,"Silky on the outside, fleecy on the inside, now my go to base layer.A dress shirt fit for me is 16 32-33, about a medium. Ordered this size L for a perfect fit.",5
B07DF4CYSR,Comfortable and good fitting thermal shirt.,5
B07DF4CYSR,"the turtleneck is a little too tight for a large size, but it will loosen up with wear. also, the thermal johns are not as thick as the Jane's. other than that, I believe it will be ok.",5

B07DF4CYSR,"It is a warm, lightweight shell.  Resists the wind, and the interior is a comfortable, warm cotton.",5
B07DF4CYSR,"An undershirt, even a thermal one should cost under $10. After all, it's just a tee shirt made of polyester and a little spandex. But it's nice. Soooh.",4

Their quality 4 way stretch material will keeps you warm and comfortable on those chilly days. The breathable fabric wick away moisture and keep you dry.

B07DF4CYSR,"Received today. It is just as described, and much more affordable than some of the big names. I tried it on, and it is very soft (as advertised).USE THE SIZE CHARTI normally wear XL shirts. But, I used the chart and ordered the size recommended.  I am glad I did. If not I would be sending the shirt back. It is a touch loose, but I rather that than skin tight.",5

B07DF4CYSR,Perfect fit. True to size. Nice and warm.,5
B07DF4CYSR,Excellent product unfortunately their choice of shipping carrier is extremely poor. The hassle with shipping will keep me from making any further purchases of this excellent product = sad!!!!!!,5
B07DF4CYSR,"I ordered a men's size hoping the sleeves would be longer. they are ok, but could be just about 1 inch longer would have been perfect!",4
B07DF4CYSR,All good,5

Kinda felt like a tight hug over my entire upper body and made me a little itchy. Maybe get one size larger?",4
B07DF4CYSR,Perfect,5
B07DF4CYSR,I wore  it walking in very cold weather under a sweatshirt and stayed very warm,5
B07DF4CYSR,Used inge knife jfk just,4
B07DF4CYSR,Nice material,5
B07DF4CYSR,Bought the same shirt in Jan '23. This one is a bit lighter and thinner.,4

B07DF4CYSR,Very comfortable and is keeping us warm. They seem to run a bit small. Next time I will size up.,5
B07DF4CYSR,It's the softest shirt I ever wore. I ordered a medium and it fits snug but comfortable. You may consider ordering a size up. I f I gain a couple of pounds it would be to tight. I will be ordering more.,5
B07DF4CYSR,"Specifically purchased this in anticipation of attending a COLD football game.  The temperature was a non issue.  Soft, fits right and washed well.  Great buy and value.  Recommend!",5
B07DF4CYSR,"I am 5ft 9"" tall and ordered size M. Overall I like the style and size fits well, however the sleeves seem little too short so I won't be purchasing this brand/style again.",4
B07DF4CYSR,"I hate long sleeves that the wrist cuff is loose, or is stretched out beyond normal after a few wears. This shirt is more of a tight fit and the sleeves fit. I'm 5'9 137lbs and a medium is about as tight as I'd want to go with this. The fit as not quite as tight as compression fit, but close. The thin fleece lining provides a great level of warmth that traditional ""waffle"" thermals. This shirt is ideal if you want much better warmth that traditional ""Long John's"" while almost being just as thin.",5
B01AK991M8,"I love these pants! I ordered one to try out and then I reordered five more pairs right away. The fit is really fantastic and they're super comfortable! I wear them almost everyday. They're great for workouts, walks, hikes, and general daily wear. They also make great pajamas and lounge pants! They're well made with strong seams and stitching.",5
B01AK991M8,The length is too long for a man who is 5'11.,5
B01AK991M8,"They are what I wanted... No elastic around the ankles. They are thinner then I thought, but they work for what I needed them for. They are great around the house and something light for the gym. I bought more.Yes, they have pockets. I think they are true to size. They don't run small. Warmth... I wouldn't use them outside in winter up north, but around the house and at the gym they are great",4

B01AK991M8,"Super comfortable. I ordered medium and it fits perfectly and also perfect to 32"" leg length. Fairly light weight material. Nothing fancy but nice to lounge around in or wear to and from workouts.",5
B01AK991M8,"The listing came up while I was looking for sweat pants.  These aren't that, they are comfortable enough but thin and more like ""pajama pants"".  The waist on an xl fits right with the drawstring, the length is about an inch to long on me.  There is no elastic at the ankle.  Meh...whatever.  They seem to be quality but understand what they are before buying.  The delivery was easily on time.",4
B01AK991M8,"super thin material, lame drawstring that's not super fun to use*, and not for people with a dumpy. i mean if that's what you need, it's good for the price, but if you care about those things go elsewhere*it's just a singular loop of drawstring. i'm not into knots so idk how you'd tie it in a way that you could easily do it and undo it when you're getting in and out. it just makes the sweatpants feel cheap.",4
B01AK991M8,"the plus: the pockets are good fabric and fully died navy blue as the pants are.  waistband and fabric are good after i cut the overly crazy big tag off.  the bad is how there is no elastic at the ankles and they are too lightweight to be called sweatpants, more like light joggers, i so like them as an under layer in winter or a pajama",4

B01AK991M8,"These are great for the price. Even though they are thin material, my bf says they're comfy. However the leg length options were a little weird when I purchased them. There weren't any good 29"" inseam at the time purchase so I had to go with a little longer and just hem them up. If you're on a budget these are good pants, but I don't recommend for winter warmth.",4
B01AK991M8,"I'm using these for lounge pants / pajama bottoms. They are not too heavy, but definitely not thin. The cut is pretty good, but I probably should have gone one size larger for my intended use.",4
B01AK991M8,Little baggy but comfortable and lightweight,4
B01AK991M8,"These pants are as described, but very light weight.  I've bought what I thought was the same product in different colors and they are quite a bit heavier in the weave.  Other than that, I like them but will reserve use to warmer weather.",4

B01AK991M8,"I got this for my son who is growing too fast and needs longer pants now, and even though they fit his 5'8 height and waist that is a true size S (we got S), he rejected them. He said they were too rough and scratchy somehow, and he didn't even want to try to break them in. I had to return, but I was refunded without any issues.I know for the price you don't expect anything amazing, so I wasn't shocked, but still a bummer because now I have to spend more money on something similar but from a different brand made with a different fabric composition.",4

B01AK991M8,"I'm not a fan of these but the description turned out to be accurate for my build.I got the XL Charcoal Heather color and it's 60/40 blend.Fabric is light, like a t-shirt you can see the light through. Not a fan but I'm going to try them out, price is a bargain anyway.Description says 33 "" inseam and that is about right.Open cuff on leg as advertised, my first sweats like this but I'll try them out.",4
B01AK991M8,I bought two pair of them and have been wearing them for a few days now and I like them but they are not very thick compared to my other sweat pants but in the summer they are great.,5
B01AK991M8,"I have these pants in 2 sizes (XL & XXL), and 3 colors (dark blue, black, charcoal gray).  In both sizes, the gray pants have a different cut than the blue or black.  The legs on the blue and black are straighter, and wider at the knee.  Unlike the blue and black, the gray pants come from the waist, taper into the knee, then come out again.  The gray pants also are smaller overall, size-wise - smaller waist, shorter length, etc.  I end up wearing an XL in blue and black but need the XXL for the gray.  There really is quite a bit of difference, so you may need to size-up.  I always line dry these.",4
B01AK991M8,"These could almost pass as regular pants. They are super comfortable. Loose fit, appreciated by older folk. Will use these around the house - a bit thinner than sweats than usual, but great as PJs, or a casual outdoor wear. I just need other, warmer sweats for the cooler days, which is why 4 stars.",4
B01AK991M8,These are super lightweight. They are not sweat pants - they are casual pants for summer or early fall.,4
B01AK991M8,Quality,4
B01AK991M8,"They're inexpensive sweats. Probably won't wear them to the gym but they're fine around the house. Not exactly wild about the continuous drawstring, but that's not a big deal.",4

B01AK991M8,Is very nice recommended,5
B01AK991M8,My husband loves these. He said they are very comfortable.,5
B01AK991M8,"Weight wise, these are between athletic sweats and lounge pants. Perfect for me. Good inseam length. Nice fabric blend.",5
B01AK991M8,Good fit. Good quality. Great deal for the price.,5
B01AK991M8,"My husband lost a lot of weight. So I had to order new pants. Thought I try these out. The waist is great but the length is crazy. He'd have to be well over 6' for the length to be good. I know not every man is 5'7"" but I hate having to cut off at least 6"".",4
B01AK991M8,These are a good summer sweats. Or casual knock about.,4
B01AK991M8,Just as described,5
B01AK991M8,easy to handle,5
B01AK991M8,"Great buy, comfy and warm.",5
B01AK991M8,Great pants but to long,5
B01AK991M8,"What I like is the way the cotton jersey material fits and feels. They are loose, soft, and flexible but not too thick and hot. If you want heavy fleece or elastic ankles these are not for you. You can even buy a size smaller for a better fit since the jersey is flexible and the waist is elastic. 33-34"" Inseam should be long enough anyone under 6'3.",5
B01AK991M8,Exactly as described,4
B01AK991M8,"These are super soft right out the package, exactly what I was hoping for and the price was right!",5
B01AK991M8,"I wouldn't classify these as sweatpants. But they are comfy, although thin.",3
B01AK991M8,Fit is perfect. Pockets hold the cell phone just fine. Comfortable and gym flexible. Didn't notice any size change after washing.,5
B01AK991M8,"light weight, keep shape, good around the house pant, washes without a problem",5
B01AK991M8,Great for the price,4
B01AK991M8,"If you think your getting a pair of sweatpants, think again.These pants are like wearing a sweatshirt on your legs.",3
B01AK991M8,Wish the material was more of a normal soft sweat pant material.  Material is a bit rough.  Fit is great.  My son (wears a men's size medium) loves that they are baggy and do not taper.  He despises when the bottoms are tapered or tight.  So these worked out great.,4
B01AK991M8,"These are more like the ""pajama bottom""/""lounging"" pants than the typical ""sweat pant"" material; these have NO fleece lining, which is what I wanted.  That said, they're comfortable and lightweight, and not a bad alternative to traditional sweat pants.",3
B01AK991M8,"These feel more like lounge wear than sweatpants. However, my son say they are really comfortable.",4
B01AK991M8,"The fabric is a little thin for sweat pants, but they feel good. Especially in the summer",4
B06Y5RM3F9,I got these quickly and they are great dress socks with excellent material that did not hurt my feet as bad as others after moving around so much. Color is a great black and length was perfect as well.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Very happy with these. Hope they last for a while.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Very confortable quality fairly good would buy agin.,4
B06Y5RM3F9,Bought these because they were the right height for my needs,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Good for shoes and boots.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,I like the socks. They are comfortable. But they don't seem to last very long.After washing them 6 time they now have holes. Not just near toes but at theankle too!,3
B06Y5RM3F9,Nice comfortable socks that fit well.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Thank you,5
B06Y5RM3F9,The socks are an excellent buy. They were too small for my wide feet.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,I love the socks they are for my son but I love them a lot.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"I purchased the US men's size 8-12.  I have swelling from an old injury in one leg and at a 10.5 shoe size, the tops were still binding enough to cause marks after a short while. While these won't be all-day work or travel socks, I'll still use them for errands and day-trips.",4
B06Y5RM3F9,Nothing special gets the job done,4
B06Y5RM3F9,"Because of foot pain, I have been needing larger socks. Not bulky. Not athletic. Mostly cotton, for absorbancy. And I have run up against the problem that the large majority of men's socks are made and sold on the one size fits most principle. That has forced me to look for socks in the big and tall section, where I have found a much poorer selection and higher prices. These socks are meeting my need. I cannot speak to durability, because they are new.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,Nice and soft too,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Fit,4
B06Y5RM3F9,I like very much the items and dislike the fact that you no longer ship to my address in Micronesia,4
B06Y5RM3F9,Right size but not the texture I expected.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,I like these socks but I keep accidentally mixing up the left and right socks. This causes uneven wear and makes me walk funny.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Aug 5, 20204 - Good fit, good comfort, good feel, good looks.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"But pretty thin. If you need something pretty sturdy and mostly cotton, look for an alternative.",3
B06Y5RM3F9,They were great before washing afterwards they shrank alot. My husband ended up giving them to the kids.,3
B06Y5RM3F9,My kid wears these when with his regular tennis!,5
B06Y5RM3F9,This is a pretty good set of mens socks.  The fabric seems like it will hold up and the fit and comfort are great.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Good quality and fit, very comfortable.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,I wear a lot of dress socks every week and these socks are comfortable and don't wear out quickly.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Kinda thin.,4
B06Y5RM3F9,"They are socks, fit well and do what they are supposed to.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Very comfortable, fit well, good sizing. I was looking for socks that are thin without feeling cheap. If they prove to be as durable as they are comfortable it's a great find.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,Purchased for my husband and he had no complaints.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,These are nice dress socks that are comfortable Thank You.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Comfortable great fit.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Soft comfortable not tight,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Bought this for my 97 year old dad. He had a hard time pulling his old socks all the way up to his knees and these socks were easier to pull up to mid-calf.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Great replacements for my old socks. Good fit.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Nothing to dislike good product...,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Use them as dress socks,5
B06Y5RM3F9,real nice confy fit,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Usually I purchase the dress socks brand GoldToe, but decided to give these Amazon essentials a try, since I purchased another product from them once before and was impressed. These socks are just as good if not better than any of the leading brands. The comfort and quality are amazing AND for the price you really can't beat it.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"These socks were the perfect gift for my son! He loves the colors because they match all his work/dress pants, and they feel just wonderful, like the upscale brands sold in department stores. He is a real stickler for socks and their seams, and these were an instant winner. They are durable, and will probably last him for years to come. You cannot beat the price for 5 pair of men's dress socks!",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Product ok, but they are too long for my tastes.  It would be nice if they were about 3-5 inches shorter.CMK  7/19/23.",4
B06Y5RM3F9,These met expectations,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Already have holes in several pairs within the toe box area,3
B06Y5RM3F9,"the description does admit that the socks are tight fitting.  However, tight is not the word.  i wear a size 10 and theoretically these should fit up to a size 12 - no way.  they're like wearing a turnicat on your foot.  the ONLY reason i gave them 3 stars is because they are nice socks - if you perhaps were a size 6.  hmph",3
B06Y5RM3F9,"i deliberately ordered a larger size than i wear for comfort reasons and ecause every time I order sox they nare too small, so i ordered a size 13 to 15 to make sure they fit and they were still so tight i could not get them on",2
B06Y5RM3F9,Most other black socks tend to rub up against the leather and cause blisters with walking any distance. These socks are comfortable with loafers and leather dress shoes.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"These socks seem to fit perfectly and are very comfortable after wearing them for 10 hrs. I cannot speak to their durability or how they will stand up to repeated washing. Regarding their wearability, they are comfortable, and the spandex is not excessively tight on my leg.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Love it, very breathable socks",5
B06Y5RM3F9,Love these socks - described as dress but very wearable for everyday wear with jeans!,5
B06Y5RM3F9,I would buy here again.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,I had been shopping the big box stores for that past couple months looking for some black dress socks.  Couldn't find any.  Then I got an idea to shop Amazon for them.  Viola!  They had some!  I ordered and got them and have worn them.  Very nice socks!  They're comfy and fit nicely!  Thank you!,5
B06Y5RM3F9,comfortableclean,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Excellent product!  This is made Very Well!  I Highly recommend this product,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Fit was excellent,very satisfied.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,Better than thought they b.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"socks fit good as expected , do not order ANYTHING  from china SHIPPING  , I have had 3 items not delivered but [ I WAS BILLED AND AMAZON WONT HELP]",4
B06Y5RM3F9,These socks seem to be wearing the same as more expensive brands.,4
B06Y5RM3F9,My husband loved them. They are durable but thin so he can wear them with his work boots. He is a Law Enforcement Officer and needed something that didn't tear apart but kept his feet cool and dry as well.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Bought these for my husband and they fit well, and are comfortable.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,Good,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Once I've tried them on felt like a glove to my feet. And after a days work and comming home and taking them off my feet were dry and feeling good. They also passed the washing test with full colors no fading or stretching. Buying a second order.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Comfortable, and light. Easy to put on and take off. Don't know about durability, just got them.  Good price!",5
B06Y5RM3F9,Faded after a few washings Still holding up well,4
B06Y5RM3F9,Liked the socks my husband states best socks for the $,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Nothing fancy. Just comfortable, soft yet durable socks at a very reasonable price. Better than any deal I could find at Costco. Stretches well and will fit a large variety of sizes and shapes.  Amazon Basics gets a huge win over Kirkland on this round.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Very warm, very comfortable",5
B06Y5RM3F9,It's comfortable and looks good! My husband likes them.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Comfortable, fits",4
B06Y5RM3F9,washes well.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Very comfortable fit. Not super long in the calf.,4
B06Y5RM3F9,My son had to wear these with his ffa uniform. He said they were very comfortable. Not to heavy.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,These are good dress socks. I didn't want to spend too much money on dress socks and these did the trick.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,Nice fit.  Seem to be quality.  Hopefully they will last a long time.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,They were a little too tight,5
B06Y5RM3F9,I wear these to work everyday - no complaints at all!!!,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"They work but I wouldnt buy them again. The elastic in them is garbage, im constantly having to pull them back up. They are pretty thin, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, but they seem like they might rip or snag easily, and when stretched all the way your skin can be seen through the stitching. The toe seem is also a problem, if the seem is on your toes it will chafe big time and cause irritation. Biggest complaint is that they dont stay up.. I hate having to constantly adjust my socks. For reference i am 5'11"" 150lbs.",3
B06Y5RM3F9,Love these thin soft socks.,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Santa did good! Hubster needs thinner socks for some of his boots.. these fit the bill... not too thick, not too thin!! Thanks Amazon!",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"I haven't washed any of these yet, but out of the bag:  they are thin (not the thinnest sock ever worn--that's good).  They fit my 10.5 feet.  They stay up.  They don't bunch.  They are what I was looking for.  They have no color rub-off.Now, to see how they wash...",4
B06Y5RM3F9,"I've now purchased these twice because they are practical, comfortable, and interchangeable. No more matching out of the dryer for me...these have held up nicely (including the elastic). As the description says, these don't have any pattern or print, so they're not for 'crazy-sock day'. I love them, and at this price know that I can re-stock in a year or two if needed. Thanks for a great product.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"These socks had a very nice feel to them.  They would make a better cool weather sheer sock. I wouldn't recommend them for warm weather since they do not seem to wick away moisture very well.  I think their synthetic fiber is a bit too high. Also, they collect a lot of lint at the end of the drying cycle (after washing). The price is very nice and they appear to be put together very well. They were sent amazingly fast after I ordered them.  My 1-word rate for these socks: meh",3
B06Y5RM3F9,"Some people say it ""socks"" to be me but I have to disagree.  Clothes cost way too much and socks and underwear shouldn't.  After going to Kohl's and similar stores and trying to figure out coupons and pricing, I realized...What?  Why not use Amazon?  So I did.  And I'm glad I did.  You won't regret it either.  I promise.",5
B06Y5RM3F9,"I like these socks! They aren't the best ever, but they are better than anything else I can find right now.Not too thin, fit is good, cotton...Now, I bought one pack to try with intentions to buy another if they were good... But they almost immediately went out of stock! I hate mix-matched socks! Uhg!",4
B06Y5RM3F9,Good socks good service,5
B06Y5RM3F9,"Refer to the photos to see measurements across the top of the size 8-12 sock both stretched and unstretched.They are very, very tight and not very stretchy which would make them very uncomfortable for anyone other than a person with very, very thin legs to wear.",2
B06Y5RM3F9,"Thin like I wanted, probably could  of been  a size smaller.",4
B06Y5RM3F9,Too tall and too tight on my calf. Makes dents in my skin. Overall the sock at the foot is thinner than expected. More of a sock for dress shoes going to church.,3
B01MF9GR0O,"They fit well, keep my feet warm and fit well in my shoes.  The best socks for winter weather, nice and thick and wash well.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"I like that they carry different sizes since I wear a men's size 7 so most of the time the socks I get are too large for me. The mediums fit great, are nice and soft on the inside and keep my feet warmer than my regular socks in bed. When my feet got cold, it tended to wake me up in the middle of the night and now I don't have that issue anymore in the winter time.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"I bought these to help keep my feet warm on walks and otherwise outdoors. I would have given it 5 stars but deducted one for confusing sizing.  I wear an 11-12W shoe and this calls for a medium.  I haven't worn a medium anything since maybe 3rd grade. The size guide and Amazon called for an M and glad I followed it.  Socks are thick, but not too thick to cause problems fitting in shoes. I really like these socks as they are really warm and have a good fleece feel to them inside. They are so comfortable I also wear them around the house as slippers.  Highly recommend and be sure to follow their odd sizing guide.",4
B01MF9GR0O,"A really thick sock that is both warm and comfortable . They maybe too thick for some, but they worked well for me.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"I purchased these last minute for a trip where temperatures would be around ZERO and where I would be walking A LOT.My feet were always warm and the fit was never tight or confining. It was just right!  I was so pleasantly surprised and will purchase  more and recommend these for sure. Also, I had shopped around at different sporting goods stores and found the price for these to be much more accesible. Even a better reason to buy more.",5
B01MF9GR0O,These are nice warm socks. I have cold feet and need extra warm socks during the winter season. The only issue with these socks is that they do wear at the heel easily if worn around the house without slippers. They are very thick and difficult to fit in slippers or shoes.  I have purchased these socks twice due to them being the warmest I have found available.,4
B01MF9GR0O,I bought these for my dad in a large.  He's older and his feet were getting cold at night.  He told me he loved them so I got the for myself in a Medium.  If I order again I will try the Small.  I have a size 8.  These sizes are a range.  They fit but are definitely noticeable big.  They keep my feet warm so I am happy with the and the design on these.,4
B01MF9GR0O,Kept my feet cozy and dry with these Winter Thermal Socks. Provide me with maximum warmth and insulation during the coldest weather. My feet were warm during a balmy 32* outdoor soccer game with 20+ mph winds. My feet were NOT cold at all. I am so buying another set of these for the rest of the family!,5
B01MF9GR0O,These socks were exactly as stated cozy and very warm. My husband needed them for on the road this winter to keep his feet toasty while sleeping in his rig.,5
B01MF9GR0O,Warm. Good product.,5
B01MF9GR0O,I really liked them because they protect against impacts when walking and from the cold up to at least 13 degrees Celsius.,5
B01MF9GR0O,These were a gift to a work friend who just started hunting. He said they kept his feet warm and we're comfortable.,5
B01MF9GR0O,Buy some you won't regret it. Warm and so comfortable,5
B01MF9GR0O,Like,5
B01MF9GR0O,Quality is fine. Comfortable. I recommend to use it.,5
B01MF9GR0O,"Very soft, not itchy.",5
B01MF9GR0O,Very warm highly recommend,5
B01MF9GR0O,"Comfortable, warm, and sized right.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"The images act like the socks are extra toasty. It similar to wearing two pairs a socks, so they are warmer but not what pictures may make you think. Inner sock is super soft.",4
B01MF9GR0O,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love these socks.  They are really thick so you may not be able to wear these if you don't have extra room in your shoe or boot.  They are so comfortable, I wear them in place of my slippers.  Maybe they should make some with the grips on the bottom.  They are great after a shower or bath and I put Vaseline on my feet and they are so soft when I take them off.  I highly recommend these socks.  Your feet will love you for it!",5
B01MF9GR0O,Very thick and warm. Great socks!!,5
B01MF9GR0O,very warm and soft!,5
B01MF9GR0O,Great,5
B01MF9GR0O,Very very Warm..,5

B01MF9GR0O,"Muy buena calidad, calienticas",5
B01MF9GR0O,Kept my feet nice and warm.,5
B01MF9GR0O,"These were mailed to sailors who are currently deployed.  Their feet are cold, and these socks have been a blessing at keeping them warm when sleeping and working.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"The quality and comfort of these socks are beyond words. The price I paid was a steal. Even though they are warm my feet didn't sweat. I washed the socks when they arrived, with no loss of shape or any fuzz. Durability is something I will post later on too soon to tell.",5
B01MF9GR0O,The most comfortable and warm socks you will have owned.  A little thick for regular shoes.  Excellent for boots.,5
B01MF9GR0O,They're definitely built for cold weather. They kept my feet warm. They're pretty thick so I could only imagine wearing them under work boots.,4
B01MF9GR0O,I love these thermal socks,5
B01MF9GR0O,This Product math my expectation and is used as intended. Thank you!,5
B01MF9GR0O,Cold feet,5
B01MF9GR0O,Fit good,4
B01MF9GR0O,"Socks are thick but comfortable. Definitely can walk around house with it to have it warmer than regular socks for the extra cold nights. Even with the heater on, feet and ears gets cold easy or last to warm up.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"Used these socks to go hunting in 11 degree weather. My feet never got cold inside my boots. Sat for 5 hours, no problem at all.",5
B01MF9GR0O,Good,5
B01MF9GR0O,Very comfortable,4
B01MF9GR0O,"First off, I love these socks and am so glad I bought them. They're very warm and the interior of the sock feels amazing, very fuzzy. The fuzziness wears off a bit over time but the socks are holding up great and still extremely comfortable.I wear a size 11.5 men's shoe and I bought the large size, which says it's for shoe sizes 9-12, but these socks are still way too long to fit my heel when the sock is pulled all the way up. The heel of the sock is about 2 inches behind/above my heel when pulled up. Around the house without shoes, I just wear the socks very loosely and let the heel line up (very comfy), but it's impossible to put on shoes without stretching the socks out, so when I wear shoes with these I just have to live with the heel of the sock sitting around my achilles. The good news about this is they're still comfortable with shoes even though the heel doesn't line up, and if you wear a size 14-15 the large would fit perfectly, so just beware of the sizing.",5
B01MF9GR0O,Love it :),5
B01MF9GR0O,Kept my feet warm A plus !,5
B01MF9GR0O,I have neuropathy and these socks are super.  They are thick comfortable and warm all day on my feet. Would recommend them to anyone,5
B01MF9GR0O,Waiting for cold weather. These socks seem well designed. Not ready to truly evaluate ATT.,4
B01MF9GR0O,"Like the fuzzy feel and fit,however not as warm as expected from description online. Good quality and look.",3
B01MF9GR0O,These socks are very plush and warm. But if you have skinny legs they will not stay up.,3
B01MF9GR0O,Loved it,5
B01MF9GR0O,Perfect for cold nights. Very comfortable,5
B01MF9GR0O,They quality was good but to tight,3
B01MF9GR0O,I bought a pair of socks and found the best socks ever. I wear them all the time.,5
B01MF9GR0O,They do the job and keep my feet super warm! They are still really thick and I need a bigger shoe to wear these.,4
B01MF9GR0O,I work outside. These socks kept my feet warm all day. Wonderful,5
B01MF9GR0O,Keeps my feet warm even though I have neuropathy,5
B01MF9GR0O,Grandson very grateful when assigned to snow duty on Mt. Fuji.  Says they have done the job of keeping his feet warm and cozy...,5
B01MF9GR0O,"They are nice and thick, a bit to thick to wear with regular shoes or  boots",5
B01MF9GR0O,Will work for winter,4
B01MF9GR0O,Quality,5
B01MF9GR0O,These are going to keep my feet warm this winter for sure.  I work from home so basically in socks often or in the evening watching TV on the sofa.  These are going to nice!,5
B01MF9GR0O,Very thick which is great if you walk around in your house with socks. Fit securely on the feet. I'm a women's 9.,5
B01MF9GR0O,To start. These are really thick. So they are comfortable. Thought these would be great but not so much. In a mid 40's warehouse feet were cold. I have other thermal socks that were bought from amazon that are just as good for a lower price.,3
B01MF9GR0O,"Socks are thick, warm and as advertised.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"I have a seasonal job as a deicer at the international airport in my city.  I thought I would start prepping for the next season early by getting new boots and warmer socks.These socks are super thick and with my fat calves and cankles, are a bit of a stretch.  They also take up all the available room in my new slip on work boots.I'll work on the fat calves (the cankles are here to stay though) and hopefully improve the fit but I suspect that these will be reserved for the really cold below zero days.",5
B01MF9GR0O,"Wear these socks throughout the winter as slippers. Warm, breathable and cozy. The only reason not giving a 5 is that they last about one season before bottoms get holes.",4
B01MF9GR0O,"Great warm socks. Although they are super thick and may have to size up a size in boots, they will keep you warm to be inside.",4
B01MF9GR0O,Very warm,5
B01MF9GR0O,"They will keep your feet warm but you need another pair of socks with them to really do the job and even then depending on the temp, your toes may get cold still depending on how long you are out.",4
B01MF9GR0O,"I really, really like these socks.  As I age (in my 70s), my feet seem to get colder each winter, and I like to keep my residence as cool as possible to save on energy costs.  They are thick and incredibly warm.  They appear extremely well made.  I haven't worn or washed them yet (still early) so I have no idea how they will hold up., but so far, I'm impressed.  I ordered two brands of these warm thermal-type socks for the upcoming winter.  DG Hill was the winner in thickness, plush, and warmth when trying them on.  HOWEVER, I'm disappointed that one pair of the two I ordered came with one medium and one large sock.  I ordered large.  I don't want to return the order for one sock, but I sure wish I had all large socks in my order.",5
B01MF9GR0O,Served its purpose kept my sons feet warm while on his camping trip,5
B01MF9GR0O,Mantiene el calor en los pies,5
B01MF9GR0O,"I bought these socks based on the reviews. I took a trip to Longyearbyen, Svalbard Island, Norway, and was worried about my feet being cold while dog sledding. Needless to say, I was worried for nothing. These socks kept my feet completely warm the entire time we were out with the dogs in 3 degree weather. We also went on an eight hour boat tour in -7 degrees and they performed flawlessly. I am happy I bought them!",5
B01MF9GR0O,All I can say is there great would recommend,5
B01MF9GR0O,"I've been wearing heatholder socks (the other brand) as house socks for around 10 years. I would get two winters out of each pair. By the end of the first winter they've stretched enough that they gradually move around my foot while I'm sleeping. In the morning the heal is on top of my foot.  By the second winter, heels are getting a hole in them and they are moving around on my foot during the day time too. (heel working towards the top of my foot)DG socks are thicker and have a bit more stretch to them. They keep my feet just as warm as the other brand. This is nearing the end of my first winter with this sock and they are not loose enough to move around my foot and they are cheaper than the other brand. Even if they get the hole in the heal by the second winter, it's all good. I'm not going back.",5
B01MF9GR0O,I would have loved these socks but the medium way too long for me. I wear a #8 women's.,3
B01MF9GR0O,"Im a size 9.5These socks came in handy for the snow. Definitely keep my feet warm and dry. I accidentally order a large instead of a medium, so it was a little too big but still worked out fine.",4
B01MF9GR0O,"Works well if your working out in the cold, good value",5
B01MF9GR0O,"I bought these for a trip to Alaska to see the Northern Lights which required some outside time in subfreezing temperatures.  These socks are so layered my feet never felt cold in my boots.  It also felt like so cushiony, like walking on air. I actually wanted to keep them on back at the Airbnb and walk around in my socking feet. They feel super insulated, comfy, cozy and warm.",5
B01MF9GR0O,Very warm and comfortable,5
B01MF9GR0O,"These socks are nice and warm. The only complaint I have is that they are rather chunky, so I don't wear them with my shoes because they're too chunky and made my shoes too tight.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,"I was reading the Fruit (of the Loom) reviews and a reviewer mentioned that Gildan might be a better option. I bought the 6 pack of Fruit pocket T-Shirts assorted colors and a 2 pack of Gildan pocket T-Shirts navy blue. Both orders came in the same box. Fruit was in a factory labeled bag like you would buy in a store. Gildan was in an unlabeled plastic bag. Both sets XXL.Many reviewers noted that the Fruit colors were not exactly colorful. I received a light gray, charcoal gray, two dark blue and two black. Fine with me.I prefer a loose fitting T-Shirt. I don't like snug. I compared the sizes by placing a Gildan atop a Fruit. I noted that the Gildan was narrower around the middle than the Fruit. I also noted that the sleeves of the Fruit were shorter than the sleeves of the Gildan.I tried on each shirt. The Gildan was too snug for my liking. The Fruit had a looser fit and was more comfortable. Remember, both are XXL. This may not be an issue for you if you are not as big around the middle as I am.As to the weight of the T-Shirts I couldn't tell the difference, although they were a lighter weight than my old Russell T-Shirts.I took one Fruit and one Gildan and put them in the wash to test for shrinkage, figuring if they were going to shrink, best to get it over with. Setting for the wash was warm, setting for the dry was medium.Both shirts shrunk, but only vertically by about a half inch. They did not shrink around the middle. Fruit was still a loose fit, Gildan snug.After the wash, the Gildan fabric felt a little rough to the touch. That was disturbing. The Fruit's fabric felt soft - very nice.The 6 pack of Fruit cost $19.98 ($3.38 each). The 2 pack of Gildan cost $13.99 ($6.995 each). Neither breaks the bank but, hey, one's gotta love a bargain.I'm not taking points off for the shrinkage. Apparently, all T-Shirts shrink in the wash, unless you can find pre-shrunk T-Shirts that don't. One can only hope they don't keep shrinking after many washings.Fruit gets 5 stars. Gildan gets 4 because of the fit and the rough feel of the fabric post-wash. I'm returning the Gildan and ordering another pack of the Fruit.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,I love these t-shirts because they are a decent price. They last a long time and they keep their color and their shade wash after wash. True to size and don't shrink.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,They're well made n soft n comfy but I like my shorts baggy especially for work so I bought 3XL (I'm usually a 2XL) but these fit like a small 2XL so buy bigger. I am gunna order more for work but now I'm goin 4XL cause they fit small. Y'all have a good day!,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Easy ordering. Good price. Fast delivery. Super soft 100% cotton t-shirt. Fit well and are soft and comfortable. Would buy again.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"My husband is picky when it comes to t-shirts and these are the only ones he'll wear and not complain. He says the fabric is comfortable and likes the pocket on the t-shirts. I have these on autoship for him so he'll have some for work around the house, and some just to look nice when we go somewhere. They even look spiffy under a sports jacket. Great quality too. Just wash on cold, dry, fold and put away. That parts on me though. Haha",5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Pros:* good value* tagless* 100% cottonCons:* some shrinkage with first wash* inconsistent sizingAs you might expect, this is good value product as aa long as you're okay with one or two shirts being midsized (usually smaller than the rest), then you should be fine.By smaller, I mean a little tight around the torso; length from top-to-bottom is okay. Sleeves can be a bit short on some of the shirts, it's nothing major.If you're expecting 100% perfect quality, then this is probably not the product for you. If you want a good deal on six cotton shirts, this is for you.If you're planning to wear these more aa casual shirts vs undershirts, I would probably go up one size from your normal shirt size. I might do that with another pack and update my review if it's a better outcome.",3
B08F2NNTJ4,"I like wearing T-shirts but hate not having the pocket to put stuff into.  These are extremely comfortable, durable and have a pocket.  I can't ask anything more of any product.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Very affordable, sizing a tad small, especially if you use hot water wash and high temp dryer but 100% cotton for certain colors. It's hard to find 100% cotton! Thin, but they are undershirts. Husband uses for PT work outs and exercise in hot Miami and they are perfect. Onebestby corrected a mistake in their delivery at Christmas, and were completely and quickly responsive in emails and replacement. They are a good responsible company which may have been overwhelmed at Christmas but worked quickly to correct the order and I would order from them again.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,"They have good fabric, they have good stretch and it's a good deal, really. The neck doesn't get wider when you wash it.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Very soft and comfortable to wear. I love it,5
B08F2NNTJ4,They're good t-shirt but they run really small so if you're large get an extra large,4
B08F2NNTJ4,They fit perfectly. Soft with a handy pocket. Will buy again.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"These shirts are great for the price, but will shrink half a size or more on the first wash.  I buy 2XL to end up with roughly typical XL - maybe just slightly larger.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Good fit,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Quality,5
B08F2NNTJ4,These are nice shirts and I've reordered them again.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,"In the 12pk, there were 6 varies and the other 6 were all white shirts. Overall super fast shipping! Thank you!",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Wash well  True to size,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Decent tee shirts!,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Love them very much,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Quality,flattering,wearable wrinkle free",5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Tip: be sure to order a size or two bigger than you normally wear, and these t-shirts should fit great. They will shrink a tiny bit. Always wash in cold water and med or/perm press dry.These are super comfy shirts, great for around the house or a nice day outside! I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Good enough for work with jeans, workout shirt with shorts and lounge wear with underwear",5
B08F2NNTJ4,ALL GOOD,5
B08F2NNTJ4,We like the fabric quality.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Tal como describe el producto.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Product was advertised as tag free. I think that means free of tags or tagless. They have tags. Every one of them in the pack. I like the shirts and the price so they will not be returned.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Bought this item for my son.  He likes them.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,fast delivery,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Comfy!,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Lo unico malo que se encogen en la secadora,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Well made,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Terrific shirts,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"I ordered six colored blue and tan brown eversoft shirts and two grey eversoft shirts.  The six colored shirts were so poorly made that they were  unwearable.  I am not even sure they'd made good cut up shop rags.  The two gray shirts are perfectly weighted material, soft and don't twist when washed and dried.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,"I purchased Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Short Sleeve Pocket T-Shirts for wearing around the house and I'm glad I did, they feel good to wear, they are cool and nice to sleep in. I would have liked some lighter colors but that's me.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,"Looks nice, fits well, but I didn't know it came with a pocket",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Fits comfortable. Perfect for both machine and hand washing. Good material,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Serves the purpose i intended then to (.  work shirts ) comfortable,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Worked well perfect for my projects,4
B08F2NNTJ4,"These are good quality cotton pocket tshirts. They fit great, look good. Size 4x Mens t-shirts with pockets are hard to find, my husband really likes these, I ordered 2 more packages of 2 each.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,Men like to brag IT HAS POCKETS TOO!!,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Used immediately,5
B08F2NNTJ4,They were a good fit T-shirt(just what he likes,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Like other reviewers, I liked the quality of the shirts.  But ordered a variety of colors.  All the shirts I received are shades of black and grays.Great for wearing under a button down shirt in winter.  Cotton feels good, and like the pocket.  But would have liked a variety of colors as shown on the product page.Still, good quality for the price, and an excellent deal.  Especially if you're looking for grays and black tees.  Would absolutely give FIVE stars had there been the colors promised in the listing.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,This fit very well on my spouse.  They are soft.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Great pocket tees.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,I get a package of these t-shirts for my neighbor every year for Christmas. He loves them.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"I bought these for just some inexpensive workout shirts.  I have washed these a couple dozen times, and they are still soft.  Most notable are the black ones.  They have not faded a bit.  I end up wearing these almost daily because of the comfort.  They are on my Christmas list to buy again.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,Good fit and well made.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Always had fruit of the loom in my house ,great product.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,"I needed some new ""work shirts"".  I'm an IT contract worker in LA, so I don't have to dress up anymore (don't miss the suit and tie days!) but I do like to present as ""appropriately kempt"" while staying aware of the fact that I may have to handle something dirty without warning (you'd be surprised).  So basic tees are my go to solution.  The problem is that, again, I live in LA and happen to have a thyroid condition, so I run hot.  Finding quality shirts that fit a large, middle age, and tubby guy isn't easy anymore in the age of ""slim fit"" everything and I have to stay mostly, if not all, cotton to stay cool.  I'm happy to say a 2X pack here fits my 6' frame and hefty build without the embarrassing tight grip on my no longer ""slim and fit"" midsection.  The fabric is also very, very comfortable seems to breathe well.  I'll be buying more as long as they stay reasonably priced.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,T-shirts r always nice to have around they r made good quality,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Works as advertised and the price was nice.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,T-shirts are excellent. Good fit and comfortable.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Great,5
B08F2NNTJ4,My guys at home love these t-shirts. I've ordered them several times already.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,The T-shirts are a good weight.  Perfect size - XL.  My husband is tall and this shirt covers the behind area.  Very necessary!!,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Muy buenas,4
B08F2NNTJ4,I ordered L and these seem to be an XL compared to the same shirts you get at Walmart in the US. If you're looking for the same fit I would go a size down.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Comfortable weight. Good fit.  Sleeve could be a bit longer .,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Excellent product. Fits great.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"the shirts fit perfectly and they feel good as well. very fast shipping, arrived ahead of time. thank you!",5
B08F2NNTJ4,"I was looking for pocket t-shirts because I had been stuck carrying a heart monitor, which is essentially a cell phone for the monitor. Several brands were similar and had good reviews, so I bought a pack of Gildan, Hanes, and FTL shirts. The Gildan were about twice as heavy as the others and built much stronger. With the phone in the pocket the FTL and Hanes shirts sagged and the neck distorted. The Gildan was fine. The FTL and Hanes shirts were also so thin that you could see the phone right through the pocket and had loose threads here and there. The Gildan was fine and was opaque.  Bottom line: buy the Gildan. I will go that route in the future.",3
B08F2NNTJ4,"They're comfy and nice. But unlike most t-shirts, a hole continues to get bigger.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,"These t-shirts come 6 for $36, and while they wear out in about a year's worth of washing and wearing they are comfortablke and size matches the order. I've ordered several over the years.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Liked,4
B08F2NNTJ4,"I got 3 black, one dark gray and two light grays. No blue or green ones.The material is quite thin. Feels more like sleepwear. Don't expect a heavy duty shirt here that will last a while.Shirts smelled like it was washed in scented detergent. But I don't think it was washed since it shrunk in the wash.These do shrink. I got mine in XL and the seam moved up by an inch or so. So, be sure to account for it otherwise you might have 6 shirts that only fit you once.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Good quality for the price,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Fits great, good length and very comfortable. My phone does not feel secure in the breast pocket, which is half the reason I got this shirt.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,They fit fine after washing and are comfortable. The lack of color selection is why they lost a star.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,Was a gift & was a good deal,4
B08F2NNTJ4,"The shirts themselves are nice, this is a well known company. But I ordered a pack with 2 forest green, 2 olive green, and 2 blue. I got a pack with 3 black, 1 light gray and 1 dark gray. However the amount of time I have left until I was gifting it for a birthday won't be enough time to return and get a replacement. So basically I'm keeping these, they're good quality. My only complaint is the incorrect colors. I was getting them for my boyfriends 20th birthday.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,"so far so good, material and fit are as expected.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,They are a nice weight.  My husband uses them for work.  It was a good thing he ordered a bigger size as they did shrink after washing in warm water and dryer.  The hem on the bottom and sleeves wants to stay rolled up after washing and drying.  They work  for a work shirt.  There is no smell to them.  Due to the hem issue I would not say the quality is the best but it is not bad.  I do recommend ordering a size larger.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,fit perfect and great quality,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Got these for my partner. It's lightweight and soft. There was no damage when it came, and was well packaged. I bought a Medium and it fits great. It's a typical short sleeve, nothing too short.I think this is a great buy if you want a simple thin shirt.",5
B08F2NNTJ4,As described,4
B08F2NNTJ4,These are nice soft shirts.  The pocket is a big plus for my husband.  Wash and dry well.  Would recommend and would buy again.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Just as described these tees fit perfectly and are very comfortable.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Needed extra Pocket Tees.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Very comfortable,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Really can't beat the price - I love the pocket T, fits great and true to size.  These shirts last a long time, but with the price I tend to turn them over a little quicker when the colors fade a bit - usually more the 6 months in before i notice it with heavy wear and washing.  I find they do shrink a little bit after a wash or two.  It's only a little and still fit nice.  I order the variety of colors - almost always dark colors, in some packs mostly black.  But usually have at least 3 colors in a 6 pack - for the deal, it's fine to take whatever shows up!",5
B08F2NNTJ4,And fits like it should. No special washing requirements and just heavy enough to offer protection without melting you on a summer day,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"I really like these pocket tees, I use them forWork. Light and thin but also comfortable and durable. Will definitely purchase again. Great deal!5 stars",5
B08F2NNTJ4,Very comfortable and great quality. I have also bought their boxer shorts which are just as good. Will be buying again.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Good work t-shirts.,4
B08F2NNTJ4,My husband wears these shirts everyday working around the house and yard. Very comfortable and he loves the pocket . I ordered a dozen so he can have plenty changes,5
B08F2NNTJ4,"Price was crazy low, but the fabric is VERY thin.  Not a problem when it is so hot and humid outside.  They are cotton and did shrink one size after the first wash & dry.",4
B08F2NNTJ4,Not enough colors to much black,4
B08F2NNTJ4,My husband likes cotton shirts. These fit him well.,5
B08F2NNTJ4,Absolutely amazing deal you can't beat and nice and comfortable for my son,5
B08F2NNTJ4,fits fine,5
B08YHBW4J5,"I purchased this hoodie for it's function not it's fashion.  My apartment can be rather chilly and drafty during the Winter months, so I needed a new hoodie to keep me warm and snug since I work at home.  I purchased the size based on the measurements given since I needed something that I could wear over other layers.  When it arrived, it fit beautifully all of my requirements and had a few pleasant surprises.  It is very well made and spacious.  It has a bit thinner material than I expected, but it still is very warm.  It has a front pocket which I didn't expect, but it's great for carrying around small household items.  The hood also has a rope to actually close the hoodie around the head to keep my head cosy all day.",5
B08YHBW4J5,"Decent hoodie. Soft, comfortable and keeps me warm enough in cold weather. Needed a new hoodie for work and the gym but didn't want to pay $15 or more for a hoodie I went with this. Only complaint or rather a nit pick I have is that the hood isn't as large as it should be imo. I bought a large and everything but the hood is baggy. I wanted the hoode to like cover my head all Edgy like or atleast enough to block out light from your eyes for a little bit but it doesn't. Its not a big deal just wishful wants. All in all happy with my purchase. Will update if it starts fading or stitches come undone",4
B08YHBW4J5,Great hoodie for the price. Not too thick or too thin. Very soft and true to size. Great basic.,5
B08YHBW4J5,"My favorite hoodie is an XL size Adidas that cost $30-50. I've had it for 5 years. I decided to try a normal Fruit of the Loom $16 brand hoodie. How do they compare?Both are a size XL. Both are comfortable. Both have gorgeous colors.The widths at the chest and hip are roomy and identical. The lengths of arms are identical.Here are the differences:The Adidas sleeves are bigger, not longer,  1/2 to 1+ inch wider the entire length of the sleeve to the cuff. The Adidas body length is 2 inches longer. The Adidas hood is 2 inches taller. The front kangaroo pocket on the Adidas is significantly taller and wider and has larger hand insert holes by many inches.The fabric of the fruit of the loom is less heavy but not thin. All measurements were done after washing and drying in a dryer.Impression? The cost difference is huge. The fruit of the loom is 1/2 the price of the Adidas.For wearing under a vest i prefer the fruit of the loom because the sleeves are less bulky. For wearing with leggings i prefer the Adidas because it covers more. For pockets i prefer the Adidas, even tho both can hold my large cell phone. The bigger pocket looks nicer.The fruit of the loom has no markings on it. It can be warn with long skirt and a pretty scarf in winter without having logo blight.The fruit of the loom can be bloused at the waist. The Adidas cannot. No complaints about either. Is the Adidas worth twice as much money or more? It depends...",5
B08YHBW4J5,"My husband works at a job where he can only wear black sweatshirts, or zip up hoodies, so in an effort to find him his favorite, we did, and it is this sweatshirt right here!He likes that it is true to size and comfortable and the waist elastic keeps its elasticity and shape after multiple washes.I will be buying more of these sooner than later.  Easy to wear and wash, durable and comfy cozy.  Cannot go wrong with this sweatshirt!!Excellent value for your investment.",5
B08YHBW4J5,I have order 7 of these sweaters this year. They are soft and big enough to layer. They are good for heat pressing vinyl onto. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because sometimes you can see in spots where the sewing got bunched up or there are threads hanging. However I haven't had an issue with it effecting the look on the outside.,4
B08YHBW4J5,Great light weight hoodie perfect fit. I wear a XXL and sometimes the arrm length is short. But this us a true fit. And you can't beat the price.,5
B08YHBW4J5,"i love these hoodies, theyre super comfortable and very durable. theyre not the thickest hoodie but they are good for a light breeze during the fall. ive had two of mine for a couple years now without any wear and tear.",5
B08YHBW4J5,Softest and thinnest sweatshirt I have ever bought. For the price it exceeds my expectations so many projects I have made and plan to make with all of the different colors available.,5
B08YHBW4J5,Love the one I received but I have 3 more showing delivered.  1 small I received I also ordered 1 medium cream color  and 2 dark forest green.  Just want the other 3. Satisfied with the 1st small.,4
B08YHBW4J5,"Very comfortable and a easy outfit. Im a woman I got mens medium for pant and top I could do a small and it would be ok 5'3, 135 lbs.",4
B08YHBW4J5,Grandson wears them to work & anytime it's cold outside todays temp 25 cold.1 is Med Gray other is Black size L.Will buy them again soon only for me!,5
B08YHBW4J5,Hoodie fit great. materials are sturdy and it didnt seem to shrink like my others have always done. Again another great product from Fruit of the Loom.,5
B08YHBW4J5,"Great basic sweatshirt.  Good quality, comfort,  and weight, especially for the price.  Didn't shrink at all.",5
B08YHBW4J5,These are as thick as we were hoping for in a hoodie. Otherwise really great quality and easy to add HTV to.,4

B08YHBW4J5,Soft and comfortable fabric,5

B08YHBW4J5,Perfect,5

B08YHBW4J5,"I bought 4 of these sweatshirts because on the image, it shows the sweatshirt has the folded and stitched ends in the hood string (a slightly higher value than your traditional taped ends).  But instead, I get the sweatshirts with the taped ends in the hoody strings.  Not cool Fruit of the looms.",4
B08YHBW4J5,I have purchased several colors. The size and fit is perfect. They hold up well. I have washed mine several times and the quality is the same. This might be the best deal on Amazon.,5
B08YHBW4J5,Awesome,5
B08YHBW4J5,"I'm a 5'2 127 lb woman and bought the men's large. I like my sweatshirts to be roomy, not tight. This is perfect, it's warm, comfortable and fits nicely.I have to order another one because my daughter borrowed it and loves it too,so I gave it to her. Priced very reasonably.",5

B06XW85TSB,"I recently purchased this six-pack of black undershirts from Amazon, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with my purchase. These undershirts have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe, and here's why.First and foremost, the comfort level of these undershirts is outstanding. The fabric is soft against the skin, providing a smooth and pleasant feel throughout the day. Whether I'm wearing them under a dress shirt at the office or paired with casual wear on the weekends, these undershirts consistently deliver on comfort.The fit is another standout feature. These shirts have a perfect balance of snugness and flexibility, contouring to my body without feeling restrictive. The sleeves are just the right length, and the overall length of the shirt ensures it stays neatly tucked in, maintaining a polished look.Durability is crucial when it comes to undershirts, and I'm happy to report that these shirts have held up exceptionally well. After numerous washes, they show no signs of fading, stretching, or losing their shape. The quality of the stitching and fabric speaks to the attention to detail put into their construction.The rich black color hasn't diminished over time, and I appreciate that these undershirts maintain their sleek appearance even after repeated laundering. The color also makes them versatile, seamlessly complementing various outfits.One of the things I value most about this purchase is the affordability. A six-pack at this price point is an excellent deal, especially considering the quality of the product. It's a cost-effective way to build up a collection of reliable undershirts without breaking the bank.In conclusion, I highly recommend these black undershirts from Amazon. They offer a winning combination of comfort, quality, and affordability. Whether you're dressing for a professional setting or casual occasions, these undershirts are a reliable and stylish choice. I'm genuinely pleased with this purchase and will likely be adding more to my collection in the future.",5
B06XW85TSB,"Thin, inexpensive, but well-cut men's undershirts. They don't have the technical fabric or closer fit of the Under Armour or Calvin Klein.. But the price is much lower per shirt, and the insubstantial, non-clingy fabric is light enough to forget you're wearing that layer.I was looking for new, basic black shirts after my usual suppliers had grown unreliable-- something that would look good under a button-down shirt or sweater, wouldn't add bulk, wasn't super expensive, was long enough to tuck but not too long  so I could still wear it out, and wouldn't look bad if worn by itself.  I also tried the Calvin Klein ""Men's Undershirts Cotton Stretch"" and the Under Armour ""Men's Cotton Stretch Crew Undershirt"":* This Amazon Essentials is the most ""under-shirt"" of the bunch. The thin fabric doesn't hide much. The sleeves are loose rather than fitted, and slightly longer than the other two. The ""L"" doesn't cling on the shoulders or back. It feels like a thin version of a normal tee-shirt cut. The sleeves are a bit bulky under another shirt.* The CK is a stretch fabric (which usually wears better over time than plain cotton), but not too fitted. The material is thick enough to wear comfortably as a tee. It has a really nice roll collar (a folded/stitched collar rather than a flat one-- rolled ones don't get messed up as quickly by repeated wash/wear cycles). There's a white CK tag on the hem that stands out a bit too much if you wear it untucked. The CK is the most expensive of the three.* The UA is the most fitted of the bunch, with the shortest sleeves-- it'll be easiest to wear comfortably under another tight layer. The stretchy material is good quality and like the CK could be worn by itself, although its clinginess requires a reasonably athletic build in that case.I tried size ""L"" in all cases. All three brands break at the right spot (hip) to be tuckable for most heights. I like the Amazon Essentials the least of the bunch since I don't like to fiddle to get my under sleeves to sit right, but it's going to be the most familiar fit for people who regularly wear undershirts. It's also the cheapest.Like Amazon's other house brands, Essentials is a good choice for ""can't decide between brands"", providing value without having to spend too much time comparison shopping.This shirt is a little too under-shirty for the ""wear by itself"" category, but otherwise works well. Recommended if you want a basic, standard-fit undershirt.",4
B06XW85TSB,"For background, im 6' 0"", 225 lbs, and i body build. I ordered these in xl, and they fit perfect! Theyre a bit snug, which is perfect for me since I will be using these as undershirts. Relatively comfortable, not the softest ever but good enough. I reccomend these if you're looking for a good undershirt",5
B06XW85TSB,"Awesome!!!  Here is how I buy clothes.1. I like low cost. a. Amazon is low cost.  And I don't have to drive 50 miles to the Outlet store.2. I buy the same clothes over and over.  Always the same sizes and colors for the basic items. a. I buy Champion long boxer briefs, preferably made in Vietnam. b. I buy sock from Johnston and Murphy. c. I buy t-Shirts (and most other items) from Brooks Brothers Outlet.Unfortunately, Johnston and Murphy's over the calf blue merino wool socks change over the year.  Double pipes at first, then single pipes close together, then triple pipes.  All I want is the same exact blue sock and same exact grey sock year after year so that I can avoid matching socks out of the clean clothes basket.  No, what should be the same exact sock is a big mix and match event every morning.  Same thing with Champion.  Why do I have to check to see what country they are made in before buying them.  Why can't I just trust that Champion underwear are the same the world over.3. I like high quality.  Here is how I define quality: a. Don't skimp on material. b. Long staple threads. c. Ergonomically cut.Every single sock manufacturer out there is skimping on material on socks.  Johnston and Murphy, Brooks Brothers, all shorter as the years go by.  They make them a quarter of an inch shorter.  It doesn't sound like a lot.  But I have to keep pulling up my new socks.  I never have to pull up my old socks.  How much money is being saved by cutting the socks a quarter inch shorter?Brooks Brothers t-shirts are still pretty good.  I have stuck with Brooks Brothers because every other t-shirt manufacturer that I've tried makes them an inch shorter, which means they come untucked.  Brooks Brothers t-shirts always stay tucked in.  And they don't pill after 10 washes.  I hate pilled t-shirts.  I hate them!Ergonomically cut: my mother bought me some gold toe socks.  I have big calves.  The elastic cut into my calves by the end of the day.  Five year old Johnston and Murphy socks are butter smooth.  The new ones are starting to cut with a sharp rigid thread around the top.  Brooks Brothers has a nice soft elastic at the top--if you buy the non-outlet variety--which go for $25 - $50 per pair.  That's a lot of money for socks when I like to keep 15 pair of blue and 15 pair of grey in the drawer after a full wash.  That would be like $750 - $1,500 for socks.  But the ergonomics on a sock make the difference between a beautiful day and a day that makes you feel like you've been sweating out in the sun.So, here is the scoop on the Amazon Essentials t-Shirts:1. Value: They are $16 for 6 shirt.  So, that's about $32 per year that I would spend on t-shirts.  That's Awesome!2. Consistency: Amazon gets it!  They actually advertises that they are not going to keep switching up.  You get the same thing every time.  I'm sure they will find a better way to make something and that a change will occur every now and then.  That's fine if they make an improvement.  But I'm betting it will not be changing the number of pipes running down my socks.  I'm sure other brands change the number of pipes because they found a factory in one country that makes they cheaper than in another country.  And they are not made to Johnston and Murphy's specs.  They are just  socks already being produced by another manufacturer at a lower cost than the last factory.3. Ergonomics: The t-shirts fit well.  From what I can tell so far, Amazon Essentials t-shirts use long staple cotton that will not pill.But all of this is really to communicate to Amazon.  Nice job with Amazon Essentials!  Would you *please* make some over-the-calf dress socks.  I will love you even more than I already do.  Please consider making long inseam boxer briefs that somehow keep the legs from riding up or don't start slipping down.  Also, I wear a lot of all cotton, non-iron dress shirts.  All cotton, non-iron, pleated, chino's would be awesome.  Long rise, gaberdine dress slacks would be great!  But, maybe I'm getting beyond the essentials with the slacks.  But please, the socks!  I hate every reasonable priced sock, that I've tried, that is made today.",5
B06XW85TSB,"These white t-shirts are very soft and comfortable but the main cons are that they shrink a lot more than other brands after drying, the arm sleeves are very short, and the threading is poor with loose strings on several shirts.",3
B06XW85TSB,These shirts are very good and priced well. I wear them to the gym all the time and they survive a lot of wash while keeping a good shape,5
B06XW85TSB,Very comfy. Will order again,4
B06XW85TSB,"today, I got my 100% cotton t-shirts. T-shirts that are a polyester mix make me itch. I was very happy with this product and the price.",5
B06XW85TSB,they are very comfortable,4
B06XW85TSB,"I bought these for work shirts, they are the perfect fit and super comfortable. Everything I have purchased from the Amazon essentials brand has been GREAT!No lie!",5
B06XW85TSB,WEll- fitting and just the way I like them.,5
B06XW85TSB,"washed 2 times, hasn't shrunk. For the price its a good deal. will buy again",4
B06XW85TSB,My husband love's these shirts! They look really nice on him. He mainly wears them under his clothes everyday.,5
B06XW85TSB,Little on the thin side but works as a white T,4
B06XW85TSB,I ordered these since I had already worn them before. The fit is good and the materials are soft and comfortable. Something simple for hot or warm weather.,5
B06XW85TSB,I like the fact I have more undershirts to wear now.,5
B06XW85TSB,"They are better than more expensive store bought shirts. They have held up many uses, color looks great, true to size. They fit well also.",5
B06XW85TSB,good for the price,5
B06XW85TSB,These T-shirts fit properly and are a very good value for the price,5
B06XW85TSB,"Bought size XL and fit was pretty short, took measurements and it barely passes as a Large. I sell clothes for a living so I know my measurements.  Basically you need to buy XXL just to get a Large size. Comfortable overall. Not bad for price. Just very bad sizing. Couldnt imagine how bad it would fit if put through the dryer.",3
B06XW85TSB,It simply does what it is supposed to do. This is a repeat purchase and I am pleased with it. Nothing to wirte home about. I particularly like the fact that it is very light and comfortable. and it stood the test of time. I have been wearing them for at least 2 years. Go for it.,4
B06XW85TSB,They are decent quality shirts. I like the feel of the material as it is soft. My cousin finds them very comfortable.,5
B06XW85TSB,"order 1 size larger than normal, they run small and short in size, fabric is good.",3
B06XW85TSB,These are great for just wearing under a work shirt while in the hot dry sun. These are not for the hot humidity because they will fold on the neck. Also these are short so for me wearing as t-shirt and not an undershirt they don't work.,3
B06XW85TSB,I've bought these t-shirts multiple times due to their versatility. Great quality shirts that don't shrink much at all after washing. Looks good worn both out and in and great value. I've bought Mediums to wear out and about and XL to wear at home for comfort.,5
B06XW85TSB,Ok,3
B06XW85TSB,One wear and wash/dry ultra low heat and they shrunk.,3
B06XW85TSB,"These shirts are ok. They are a thick cotton material, so maybe a little heavy for summer. I think the torso length ought to be a couple inches longer, to make sure they stay tucked, and maybe make the cotton material a little lighter. But the shirts seem to hold up fine.",3
B06XW85TSB,"Went out on a limb and tried these. Been having a lot of problems finding black t-shirts that are long enough due to my broad shoulders and longer torso....and dad bod belly. I must say I am impressed. They are very soft and have that extra length I was looking for. I just received them so I cannot comment if they will remain that way after a wash and a dry. I do like how they huge my body in all the right places giving more of a slimming look. They also don't ride in the armpits which is a plus. I am not one who likes clothing that clings to me, but with the softness and breathability of these I really don't mind it. I might add it is a very nice black as well. I will have to see if they hold up after a wash and a dry, but I plan on a cold wash with they rest of my black t-shirts. If not I will have to try out the XXL. These XL shirts are true to size and at a great price I will deffinitly be back for more. Great job Amazon Essentials keep it up!",5
B06XW85TSB,Purchased before. Always fits good. Has good weight. And looks good under shirts. And great price...,5
B06XW85TSB,I bought these about a year ago and they were excellent. I need some more so I bought another two packs and both packs have a yellow tinge to them when compared to my old shirts which are at least 1-year-old. It's very disappointing and it's obvious when you compare the two.,3
B06XW85TSB,Grudgingly very happy. Amazon made me a believer here.,5
B06XW85TSB,"It's so difficult finding clothes for my husband.He's tall and I was hoping these shirts would be great for him.I always wash everything before putting stuff away.I had him try on the shirt before washing and it was perfect.The length and fit for his body.After the wash it shrunk a bit and lost a bit of its shape.Thankfully I bought him a large thinking that could possibly happen.The shirts still work as undershirts but it would have been nice to find a shirt that doesnt shrink.For reference hes 6'2 and 185lbs.I will say though, the shirts feel great.",4
B06XW85TSB,Comfy and soft. These feel and looks better than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. Don't hesitate to buy because they are branded as Amazon Essentials. These are good quality. I've bought them a few times because I'm very satisfied.,5
B06XW85TSB,"For what they are, they're good. Breathability is 3/5, moisture wicking is 3/5 material is 3.5/5. As a cheap set of undershirts, they do well enough for most people. I've had them for quite a few months now and they've held up pretty well after tons of wear and washes. Would recommend.",4
B06XW85TSB,"Good t-shirts for the price. They are comfortable, fit well and look good.",4
B06XW85TSB,order xxl and they are more like xl,3
B06XW85TSB,"Im3 a woman and I layer with men's undershirts in the fall/winter and always have for many reasons: 1.) they're breathable since they're 100% cotton, which I prefer; 2.) they come in multi packs making them so much more affordable than regular women's t-shirts; 3.) they have a closer fit than women's shirts since they're cut differently, making them ideal under long sleeved t-shirts, sweatshirts, etc., minus the bulk; 4.) since they're cheaper, I don't feel guilty when they get wrecked and I toss them.I have always bought whatever was on sale (Hanes, FOTL) at Target for years. I decided to try Amazon's since they were even cheaper than the others were on sale. As soon as I got them I could see and feel the difference in the weight of these shirts. The quality, for the price, is above average. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. These maintain their shape better, too. They shrunk like crazy which I knew they would, but I feel that only made them fit better for me. Again, I don't want any added bulk. I'm sure there are better quality undershirts out there and some may prefer a thinner material which would not make these ideal. However, I will repurchase these in the future.",4
B06XW85TSB,Be careful with high heat in dryer they shrink a lot. Not sure bout these.,3
B06XW85TSB,"They run small. I normally wear XL, so I bought XL. The shirt barely reaches my hips. The sleeves seem super short. The shoulders seem to bunch up. But I can't return them because I washed them to get the chemical smell out. Good thing I bought them for sleep shirts. But they are very soft and the material is breathable.",4
B06XW85TSB,"Who is in charge of product testing and quality control??Okay, the t-shirts serve their purpose as t-shirts. My issue, hence the 3star review, is that I read the product description completely several times, okay? I am a plus sized woman but a mans 2X/ XXL or whatever label you want to put on it is usually huge on me. So I'm reading the description. it says that the model wearing the t shirt is 6ft something in height and wearing a size medium. In the picture, the medium shirt comes to just below his waist kind of in the hip area. So I figured ok, I'm 5ft3 and a XXL will be LONG enough. Mind you this was one of the search results when I searched in the search bar for BIG AND TALL because originally I was looking for clothing for someone who is a big and tall male. Like I said I'm plus size so I know my thickness and having a larger bust may take up some of the length in a shirt but not much. Which is why I thought that a mans shirt would be long enough for me. Y'all, the length of this shirt just covers my butt. Its loose fitting on my body but how is it not long enough? Case and point, my daughter put one on and she is just on the cusp of 5ft if that much; but not at all my height yet and she's nowhere near plus size... she's still in children's size clothes (a juniors size 00 will fall off of her). I say all that to say that she has no thickness to take up any length and this shirt only comes to about 6 inches above her knees and she's shorter that I am. HOW does this happen Amazon (meaning those in charge of product testing for Amazon Essentials products and clothing, those in charge of writing product description and information and even the photographer who shot the picture)?? Amazon are you sure the model was 6ft 2? Are you sure the shirt was a medium. What happened? 2020 hit us all hard in different ways I guess. sheeshP.S. Amazon, I've been spending money on your site before many knew what it was. People looked at me strange in 2002 when I started telling people about Amazon.com. I think they thought I was talking about the Amazon rain forest or something because they would look at me crazy and I always had to explain to them what Amazon was. So with that said 18 years of being a customer I mean no harm when I say ""Amazon git yo -ish tahgetha, ya 'bouta fall apart""",3
B06XW85TSB,Average quality tshirts which are nice for the first 20-30 odd wash cycles then the wearing becomes visible starting with the collar and edges. Might buy again but very unlikely. Vinaka from FIji.,3
B06XW85TSB,"Material is very thin and not for tall individuals I'm 6'2""",3
B06XW85TSB,Love! Great soft but not too soft material. Would buy again. I bought XL because I wanted loose fitting work shirts. So if I were to order a more fitting size I would recommend Large. Im 5'7 160lbs.,5
B06XW85TSB,It's hard for me to find xs clothing that actually is extra small.. these were the closest I could find in normal adult clothing. That's a black T-shirt that I made from these breathable cotton Amazon essential shirts. I went back and bought them a second time I liked them so much cuz I iron on my own graphics.Definitely worth it size is accurate.,5
B06XW85TSB,I like the quality of the shirts. I  only received 5 shirts the second time I ordered though.,4
B06XW85TSB,"4 Stars because I wanted loose fit for medical appliance, but after wash went down 1 size.Especially like the quality of the fabric and the fit is still acceptable.Some online items tell you to up/down a size and had I had that info this would be 5 Stars.My next order will be up 1 size.",4
B06XW85TSB,Great product fast delivery,5
B06XW85TSB,"I've purchased at least 4 of these packs since 2020 and these will shrink in the laundry without using the dryer just hanging to dry at varying speeds. Some will shrink in a year, some in 6 months, others after the first wash. Other brands may never shrink but will fade after a dozen washes. There's no consistency from any brand I can see when it comes to shirts shrinking or fading. I use a warm/cool temp when washing, and I wash all my shirts together separated by color. Suffice to say mileage may vary.",3
B06XW85TSB,Bag for the buck sturdy built construction easy breathing shirt keep you cool light material comfortable for all occasions wear light stretchy not loose fits according to size,5
B06XW85TSB,"I always wash items before having my hubby wear them. Generally, I wash them and place them in the dryer. Well, after drying, they shrunk and the tee shirt was out of shape. He's still going to wear it, but this is unusual for Amazon clothing!",3
B06XW85TSB,"I'm going to copy and paste this review on three separate products to ensure that everyone can see on technically different versions of the same thing. Okay! So these shirts have finally ended a 10 year search for a solid undershirt, both white and black. I have gone through almost every brand of major undershirt maker and this version by Amazon is by far the best.I threw everything else away that I used as an undershirt and just stick to these. Simple living! For the price, the quantity, and longevity, you can't beat Amazon Crewneck as your go-to daily.",5
B06XW85TSB,Great product...thank you.,5
B06XW85TSB,"You would have a hard time convincing me that these are decent undershirts.  Sure the cotton is soft and the white is bright, but the collars...oh, man.  The collars are terrible.  Not only are collars flimsy so that you have the bacon collar, but they seem to be cut wrong too.  If I pull the shirt forward over my chest I have a scoop under my neck.  If I pull it back to tighten the collar up front I have a scoop in the back.  It isn't a sizing issue.  I have a 41 inch chest and 13.5 inch biceps so the medium shirt fits me snug on my chest and snug around the arms.  Jeez.  Just terrible collars.  It's funny, though.  I love the Amazon essentials long sleeve shirts and A frames, but these tees just don't cut it.",2
B06XW85TSB,"I have lived in Amazon Essentials Big and Tall T-shirts for decades - they are generously sized, unshrinkable, indestructible, unstainable...These are not those shirts.These are cheap thin undershirts that are undersized and shrink down a size on the first wash.The neck hole is also way too big and looks ridiculous.Do not reccomened.",2
B06XW85TSB,If your guy is super basic and just wants to be comfy. These are the best. The quality stands right next to ANY other big brand out there 100%,5
B06XW85TSB,Decent tees. I was absolutely tired of spending a ridiculous amount on White tees for my son's. Purchased from this brand for the first time. It's a bit see through. I noticed I could see the top of my son boxer (white strip) through the tee. My son likes it and told me I don't have to write a review. I said son it's for us the people lol,4
B06XW85TSB,great,5
B06XW85TSB,Buenos de buena calidad,5
B06XW85TSB,Can recommend.,5
B06XW85TSB,Wish neck fabric was wider but the shirt works for the price,4
B06XW85TSB,These aren't the best undershirts in the world. They're far from the worst. In fact they're perfectly good. I'm a satisfied customer.,5
B06XW85TSB,"I'm 5 foot 7 with an average or maybe slightly longer chest for my height. Usually shirts that are either medium or small can fit me. With this shirt, I first got the medium, and most of the fit was fine, but the shirt was very long. Then I exchanged it for a small and still the shirt is very very long. Almost looking like still 2 sizes longer then I'd like. I don't know why they made the shirt so long, but hopefully an X-small, which I've never worn before, will fit me. Just understand when you buy it, that the shirt is very stretchy going downwards, and if you were to stretch it out so it looks flat without any wrinkles like any other shirt, it will stretch and go down much farther then you would think. In short, shirt is way longer than the size suggested.Giving 4 stars because the rest of the qualities of the shirt seem very good.",4
B06XW85TSB,His T-shirts are super comfortable and a great price would definitely buy more,4
B06XW85TSB,Love the fit and feel. They get better with wash.,5
B06XW85TSB,"They are soft and wash well. He is very sensitive to tags, scratchy seams, etc, and he loves these shirts. I bought him some in several colours and he is pleased as punch!",5
B06XW85TSB,"Basically it's a good quality pack of black shirts. They fit very comfortably, maybe a bit too much. The neck ring has a apperance of it being stretched before I even wore it, but it doesn't bother me since I dont plan on wearing it outside. The fabric is on my sensitive skin feels nice too. I am quite satisfied with my purchase. 9/10",5
B06XW85TSB,"I must say, for shirts of this quality, they'd cost around 40 at least, and I never ordered Amazon Essentials apparel, they're really soft and surprisingly, they're quite dense for this price range.In short, I'd recommend these if you're on a budget because nowadays retail stores would raise brand new 4 pk shirts for $45, especially that the quality of these shirts to me are better than the CK shirts. If you're looking for an alternative to True Classic black crew neck shirts, these shirts are just as good, and they're on the softer side, and the fit is perfect (not as loose as CK cotton shirts that go for 45 for a 4 pk).",5
B06XW85TSB,The ease of ordering this multi pack of shirts & at a fair price. Will buy again. Shirts are soft. I don't feel like I overheat at 75 degrees or above. I cannot say for about 90 degrees yet.,5
B06XW85TSB,"For the price, this is one of the best men's white crew neck undershirts.  It is not so thick to make you hot wearing it as an undershirt. Most companies' undershirts have gone too thick trying to make them multipurpose t-shirt than can be used also as undershirt.  T-shirts and undershirts are not the same thing.  This shirt is perfect thickness for an undershirt.",5
B06XW85TSB,"I normally get a XL but these were much shorter than my normal tshirts. I would say size up. Other than that they were soft, good quality, light weight and looked nice. I did send them back due to the length issue.",3
B06XW85TSB,"These shirts are comfortable, but they are boxy, so don't expect a close fit. I wear an XL and find them to be a little short, and a little shorter with each wash. I would expect they fit well if you have a shorter torso and are thick in the middle. I won't buy them again. #lessonlearned",3
B06XW85TSB,"When I first opened the package of 6, size XXL, black Tees, for only $19.00 I was amazed at the softness and the roomy fit. All was perfect so I ordered another pack of 6. Eventually the first 6 all found their way through the laundry, folded, and put away while I was still going through the second set I bought. They too, went in the laundry and now I put on one of the black Tees that had been washed. I never had a shirt (100% cotton) shrink so much. The shirt does not have the type material printed anywhere but the description will tell you it's 100% cotton and to wash in cold water. If you don't want shrinkage, I'd wash in cold water and hang dry. Skip the dryer. I tried to keep that second set separated and only wash in cold water but that effort died a quick death. I really like the shirts and still wear the too small XXL but I'd be much happier if they would not have shrunk. I looked for 3XL but that size is not available. Order a size or two up and wash as though it were a normal piece of clothing and you will be fine. They are very soft.",3
B06XW85TSB,The material and workmanship was better than I expected.  They run small however and got shorter after the first washing.  If I were to buy again; I would buy one size larger than normal.,3
B07F282SF7,"Comfortable, good fit, durable through first few washes. Would buy again.",5
B07F282SF7,"Nice, soft and fits my 9 1/2 wide foot. Keeps me warmer too.",5
B07F282SF7,These socks are very comfortable and stretch perfectly to fit my feet.4 stars because they don't wick moisture away that well with shoes on.,4
B07F282SF7,I like how high quality these are for the low price. I got these for my boyfriend and he loves them. Super soft and thick but not too thick.,5
B07F282SF7,Good fit for size 13 wide. Comfortable and soft. easy to clean,5
B07F282SF7,"These socks are a mixed bag. In todays world, the size of all products are no longer what they used to be. I've seen this in all clothing, and socks are one of the worst. I'm a size men's eleven, and these are saying they go up to 14, which I'm guessing they would maybe fit a size 12. My main gripe is all socks are so tight now, going around the foot, and seem to have a band halfway down the foot, probably to hold them together, but in an older person it stops circulation and you can feel the band when walking. Years ago, socks where smooth without tension around the foot, and were comfortable. Maybe if your younger this would not bother you, but be aware it's there, along with the size being smaller than they say. They are well made, except for the circulation cutoff, I would say they are decent socks.",3
B07F282SF7,"Finally socks that fit.  I have a size 13 foot.  It has always been hard to find socks above size 12.  Now, it is much easier to find.",5
B07F282SF7,Very good,4
B07F282SF7,Good quality,5
B07F282SF7,"These socks fit well, are comfortable, and are made of quality stretchy fabric. So far l haven't had them long enough to provide an assessment of longevity. This is why l will only give them 4 stars.",4
B07F282SF7,"Good quality, Good price!Happy with this purchase.",5
B07F282SF7,"For the price, these are as good if not better than Under Armor socks I get.",5
B07F282SF7,"These are snug enough to stay put but not hurt my husband's ankles!  Also, the toes do not have a seam to hurt his toes!",4
B07F282SF7,Great fitting socks,5
B07F282SF7,Good quality socks for my husband who is rough on his socks.,5
B07F282SF7,"Ankle socks, starting to go extinct. These are good, did the job.",5
B07F282SF7,These socks are very comfortable and I enjoy using them for runs.,5
B07F282SF7,These socks are comfortable,4
B07F282SF7,I had never worn ankle socks before so this was a new experience. A pleasant experience.,5
B07F282SF7,I purchased it as a gift and the recipient absolutely loved them and says they are of high-quality,5
B07F282SF7,More durable than I expected for the money.  Excellent value.,5
B07F282SF7,I like these socks.  They are comfortable but after a few months of light to medium wear several pairs are developing holes at the heals.  They are wearing out much sooner than I expected and much sooner that other brands from the big box stores.  I will not purchase theses again because of this.,3
B07F282SF7,"I will wear them until they are worn out, then buy them again.",5
B07F282SF7,your feet needed some these work  very good,5
B07F282SF7,"I have bought many types of socks for running/ trail running. They typically have significant compression and after about a mile of running squash my toes until I am so uncomfortable that I have to pull off my shoe and readjust the sock. These do not compress my toes even on long runs, which will probably save my toenails in the long run. They are extra long size 12-14 and are comfy and a joy to wear. If you suffer from the same sock problems that I have, then I highly recommend you try these.",5
B07F282SF7,"The socks, like every other Amazon Essentials Product I buy, are in my opinion of equal or better quality to brand names. These socks are very comfortable, and my feet feel dry throughout the day wearing them. I used to pay $25 for 3 pair to have this level of comfort in socks.This is what I tell people re Amazon Essentials goods: Here's a multi-billion dollar company who'd sooner pay someone a measly $100,000 lawsuit like it was nothing vs going to court if there was even a modicum of uncertainty if one of their products caused an injury, damaged something, or hurt someone's feelings... aka a lawyer's w3t dream. So they do adhere to a strict standard.Another thing... Amazon can undoubtedly sustain themselves without making a gentleman's profit for their Amazon Essentials branded product. Like everything else their stuff is Made in China, but I used to live in China, and do business over there. Chinese products got a bad reputation because when the QC person went to lunch, the production line didn't stop. If the QC person's shift ended the production line didn't always stop. That's actually true.A Chinese product is only as good as the Quality Control department. I can tell you... Amazon is not running sweat shops like many other name brand American products are. From what I hear 2nd hand, Amazon is very conscious about the overseas Amazon Essentials work environment, and the production line from beginning to end... and a QC dept to match.  Amazon has everything to lose, and nothing to gain by making their branded products chintzy, or abusing $2/day workers.",5
B07F282SF7,"These socks are very comfortable. They are thick enough for comfort, but thin enough to breathe. They stay in place once on. Great value for the package.",5
B07F282SF7,I am giving these as a christmas gift for my dad and they are very great quality,5
B07F282SF7,I got these for my 14 year old son. He always complains socks are either to long or slide down in shoes but these were perfect. They have good cushion to them and soft! Overall great socks and will buy again,5
B07F282SF7,"They stay on when I kick my shoes off, but they are easy to pull off when I step on the toe and pull my leg up out of it. Usually if they stay on when I kick off the shoes, the sock gets stuck on the heel coming off. These pull off no problem. Cotton poly blend. Not too much poly. Thin over the foot. I like that. Too much fabric over the foot makes the shoe too tight. I'd buy these again.",4
B07F282SF7,Even though I purchased the size selection applicable to me the socks are fiddly to put on.  If you pull them up as normal socks the heal portion goes up your leg.  If you pull them on until the heel is in the correct position you'll end up with 2cm of empty sock in front of your toes that you then need to pull back evenly over the rest of your foot without creating uncomfortable wrinkles.  Otherwise they are comfortable and work well.  Seem to be well made.  Perhaps order a size smaller than you think you require?,4
B07F282SF7,Comfy for the price  :),5
B07F282SF7,1.  Reasonable price for 6 pair.2.  Extra size 12-14 is the main reason I recommend these socks.3.  Partial cotton critical to keep feet dry during football.  90% nylon sucks!4.  Thickness is good.5.  We wear size 13 football cleats. Socks size 12 are too tight for toes.6.  Fancy brands and logos like Nike and Adidas have too much nylon and only size 12.PLEASE CONTINUE TO SELL THESE EXTRA LONG SOCKS.,5
B07F282SF7,Good socks,5
B07F282SF7,"This is probably my own fault as I bought the wrong size I guess. I'm a 12 shoe, and bought the 12-14 socks. They're too big, but you can kind of squish them a bit. Sometimes though, when you wear shoes it just feels unnatural and uncomfortable. Like there's a fold in there, but when you check, you can't find anything. Maybe after these die and I replace them with the smaller size they'll feel better.",4
B07F282SF7,I've tried most every brand of casual white socks and these can't be beat for price and performance.  They're well made and last longer than all major brands.  Give them a try.  You won't be disappointed.,5
B07F282SF7,Whoop socks they are nice,5
B07F282SF7,Might expand after single usage,3
B07F282SF7,"Terrific fit, good price and still wears well after washing.",4
B07F282SF7,"I've purchase three packs of these over the years. I would say there is nothing particularly special about them beyond working as designed. I don't believe there is any extra moisture wicking effect for working out. But at the price, I wouldn't have expected that. I use them on a daily basis for ""general sock use."" (There's a phrase I never imagined uttering.)With regards to fit: I wear a size 12 shoe. I think these come in sizes 6-12 and 12-14. The first set I purchased were the 6-12 and I felt they might be ever-so-slightly small. The second set I purchased was 12-14. That was a mistake. The heel is definitely designed for a size 13 or 14 foot. Still worked but felt a bit funny. So the third pair was back to the 6-12 range.",5
B07F282SF7,Gave as gift to husband. Very warm and nice,5
B07F282SF7,I tried a few different brands of socks recently and disappointed with the size being too smallThese fit perfectly and are very comfortable. They also washed well and still feel great on my old feet! I like the design too Finally I got something that fits well!,5
B07F282SF7,"These socks are awesome. The stitching seems to be a little thicker on the heels and toes, which is nice because a majority of my socks get holes in these locations.",5
B07F282SF7,"I bought these because for a size 13 foot because I couldn't find socks for my husband in the store that went that high in shoe size. He likes these more than the ones from the store, Hanes. They seem to also be holding up well, no holes in toes or heels.",5
B07F282SF7,Liked that they had some stretch to them; at first we thought they were too large but they seem just right for size 12 feet,4
B07F282SF7,recibido conforme,5
B07F282SF7,Lighter weight tha  expected but I still like them.,4
B07F282SF7,"These are simply socks so there is not much to say, but the price was good and, after a could of weeks of using them, they are comfortable and seem to be holding up m fine. They feel breathable; excellent for moderarw to hot temperatures.",4
B07F282SF7,Thick. Comfortable.  And durability,5
B07F282SF7,Works good,4
B07F282SF7,I wear an 11 and a half shoe. If I put them on very gently they fit great and feel fine. If you're in a hurry and you pull up on them they will fit your 15 foot also. I'll buy them again,4
B07F282SF7,"I bought these socks to keep me warm while watching TV at night.BUT>.... they FIT TOO TIGHT at the top!I have size 11 feet. These are made for a wide variety of sizes, but that makes them TOO TIGHT at the top and they squeeze my legs such that that the blood flow is cut off!There is a line on my leg where the socks cut off the blood flow.  I should post a photo, but you know what I mean!Great socks! But... too tight at the top!",4
B07F282SF7,Sizing was good however I found these socks to be much thinner than I expected. Not much padding when taking long walks.,4
B07F282SF7,"This is a review for the Amazon Essentials Men's Performance Cotton Cushioned Athletic Ankle Socks.Having a size 12 foot I ordered the size 12-14 socks.The socks are a good thickness, I like the cushioning.They have a little extra length for my foot, so i think the size is accurate saying 12-14.They have held up to several washes very well and seem like they will last.However, be aware that these socks are very narrow.I have a narrow 'B' width foot and these socks are very tight for me, almost too tight.I couldn't imagine myself wearing them if my foot was any wider.If you don't have a narrow foot these may be too tight for you.",4
B07F282SF7,"Well done Amazon! Quality socks, soft and comfortable",5
B07F282SF7,"I have a larger foot, and I'm always struggling to find proper fitting socks.  This is my second purchase of these socks, as I loved my first set of six pairs, which I'm still wearing after almost a year.  The quality is better than other major brands out there, as those major brands barely make it a year before the socks begin to break down.  I highly recommend these, especially if you have larger feet.",5
B07F282SF7,WellMade and comfortable,5
B07F282SF7,Very ggod product,4
B07F282SF7,I wear a size 13 shoe (sometimes 13.5); these socks are a little loose; I hope the dryer will tighten them some. They though are comfortable on the skin. Made in Pakistan btw.,4
B07F282SF7,Socks fit well and are quality,5
B07F282SF7,Good enough quantity and quality for the price.,4
B07F282SF7,My husband liked them.,4
B07F282SF7,I'm a size 11 US mens shoes and these socks fit me perfect.  They are comfy and were exactly as described. No issues with packaging or anything.  Will be buying more when I wear them out.,5
B07F282SF7,"The order arrived on time and the socks are wonderful.  Soft, right size and toe is great!  Will order again!",5
B07F282SF7,These socks fell great and fit great. They were delivered on time.,5
B07F282SF7,"I use it to play tennis.Great quality, very confortable and it has a tiny line with  colors on it. It helps me to recognize my soks easily in the laundry.",5
B07F282SF7,"They are good socks. They feel solid and tight. I can feel it forming around my foot along with the ""padding"" support. Not sure if I'd buy again but they are nice to have. I feel like they may have shrunk in the was but that would be a me problem over them. I personally don't feel sold on them.",4
B07F282SF7,Fit well,5
B07F282SF7,I got these for my boyfriend since the ones he currently wears are looking with out and he loves these. They have arch support and breathing holes for the bottom of his feet... This was a great purchase and a great value.,5
B07F282SF7,I like them,5
B07F282SF7,"Needed socks, they came in the mail.",5
B07F282SF7,"I decided to try Amazon Basics when my Hanes socks went down in quality (holes were the norm after a month). I like these much better - they fit great and they are lasting longer than Hanes. Not much else to say, they are perfect for the price.",5
B07F282SF7,"Great fit, comfortable no matter what shoes I'm wearing.",5
B07F282SF7,"most socks are one size fits like 6-12.  I've had plenty of socks with the end of the heel on the bottom of my foot.  These actually fit a size 13 foot.  Last about as long as any other sock, and are no different other than they fit.",5
B07F282SF7,"Nice size, like the ankle size.",5
B07F282SF7,"They're a decent pair of socks. They're support is decent, but nothing spectacular. I'm not one to write amazing reviews about clothing, but they work for their intended purpose. I do notice they seem to slide more than other socks, in terms of the ankle part. It is what it is, but for the price, not bad.",4
B07F282SF7,Comfortable and nice fit.,5
B07F282SF7,"I found these socks very adequate, very pleased.",5
B07F282SF7,"Just started using these socks. Good fit. Maybe just a touch tighter than I'd like, but not nearly as tight as many of the other socks I've been suffering with lately. They put up with a week of hiking around Manhattan. I've had socks that didn't last a day doing that. Happy with them so far.",5
B07F282SF7,Very comfortable socks. Fit me well. Elastic tops that hold the socks in place. Decided to try these instead of the usual discount store purchase. Pleased with decision.  Will probably buy again when necessary.,5
B07F282SF7,It's hard to find size 13 to 14 socks.This is s perfect match. Very comfortable and not cheap well made.,5
B07F282SF7,Extremely comfortable and I walk alot for long distances every day.  Great buy,5
B07F282SF7,"These are soft, stay in place , absorb moisture and launder well. I have not had them long enough to know how long they last but they seem to be just fine. I am buying more.",5
B07F282SF7,"I wear these at my part time retail job and they have held up. I have an issue with very sweaty feet and these help keep my feet dry. They are thin and breathe well. I have put multiple miles in one day on them on multiple occasions and don't have any complaints. I will be buying different styles from amazon, in the future.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Shirts work great,  size appropriate,  good fit,  very warm and comfortable.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,Very comfortable fit. Definitely helps keep you warm.Welk made with Good Quality. Very Breathable.,4
B0B4P7N8S7,"True to size, very warm in cold weather, well made, lightweight",5
B0B4P7N8S7,I wear these compression thermals daily as I work in and outside depending on the day. These are more of a base layer and are by no means the heaviest thermals you can buy. But they add enough of a layer I'm not dying while inside as well. The quality is good and I will but these again as they wear out over time. They hold up to washing without the threads coming undone.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I was looking around for some new base layers to keep my bod warm when spending all day teaching ski lessons at a local mountain.  I liked that these were a mix of crew and turtle neck and that they were fleeced lined.  I wear these as layer #3 and I like the tight fit over the other two base layers.  The fleece adds a touch of warmth to the shirts and that really helps when the wind is whipping and it's below freezing.  The only downside I can find with these is there's no neck tag so figuring out which side is front can be challenging, at times!",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Let's start with ""I HATE THE COLD""!I bought these because although I have a number of long sleeve shirts / thermal underwear, but most of them are cotton and the problem with those is that they snag when trying to put on sweatshirts and things of a similar fabric, they are also not as warm!I live in North Texas and we have had cold weather, too cold for my liking. I work at home but smoke a lot so am vanquished to the garage where I spend all day long...Clothing... these shirts, pants from the same brand, flannel lined Lee jeans, a coat, a vest, wool socks, insulated hiking boots and a propane heater (but I don't quit smoking?)... you get the idea.In any event, if you hate the cold as I do and are outdoors, these are very nice and do a good job keeping you warm if you are layering like I do.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I thought I was buying nice knit, night shirts. So I normally take an XL but ordered 2XL instead for comfort and night time sleeping.These are beautiful - too nice to wear to bed, lol. They are a silky, satin finish with a bit of spandex, and the 2XL fits exceedingly well. I am 5'8"" and 180 lbs btw and these fit so beautifully in a 2XL.I am going to wear one for night wear and the rest when I go out, they look THAT good.5 stars all the way, but buy larger sizes than you normally would wear.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Bought these for my husband to wear under his work uniform. Really nice and he says that they are warm, not too loose or tight. You can't go wrong with these.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Got these for work since I work outdoors, definitely  helps keep ypu warmer, you still may need more layers but it does help, one thing I wish they dod was put a label on the inside neck area of the shirt, it's easy to put on backwards.",4
B0B4P7N8S7,"Not as warm as I had hoped but, that's something I expected with man made (synthetic) material.Comfortable to wear as an everyday long sleeved cool / cold weather shirt. Great cut length, most shirts I buy are a little short and won't tuck in well.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,Would buy again just as warm as underarmour for a fraction of the price,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Nice quality. Not too thick and not too thin. I wear these under my long sleeve shirt as an extra layer to combat the winter weather. I would buy again but I think the 5 pack will get me by.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Took these on my trip to Europe during winter and they were a lifesaver. I hate being cold and these fleeced line thermals kept me warm even in the cold rainy weather. I personally like thicker thermals as I would rather be a little warm then cold at all and these definitely kept me warm when the rest of family was cold. They would definitely be too thick for some people but if you like this style of clothing then this is perfect!,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Se las compre a mi esposo y le encanto buena calidad,buena tela.Gracias!",5
B0B4P7N8S7,Its works like a charm. Been more than a year but a pro tip dont get the one with the turtle neck. Those are easily visible from outside. But yeah they do work really well and keeps you warm,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Love these under gear,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Very good material,very warm,mix of colors I absolutely recommend.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,These are great undershirts for the winter!,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Quick ship. Fit perfectly.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,They are amazing. I bought these for my husband who works in a warehouse. They have to keep it cold due to the products. He can now work with his uniform and not bundled up in a jacket. Highly recommend.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Super warm.  I just got back from skiing in it, and it worked out extremely well, I was warm, but not hot enough to get sweaty...",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I liked the nice snug fit as it being a base layer. Adds a lot of warmth to the layer I wear over it, sometimes all I wear is the 2 layers if it's near 30 degrees with no wind.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,Fit good and keep you warm! I would recommend to a friend.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I've had compression shirts before and these do not compress as tight as others I've had. I don't understand how other reviews say to order larger sizes so they don't squeeze you.These shirts are warm. I noticed it as soon as I put them on, but for me they seem to keep you warm without overheating you. I haven't done a lot of physical work outside in the snow, but I'm satisfied with them. They are very stretchy as well.",4
B0B4P7N8S7,"These are the best thermals I ever wore. If you work outdoors or indoors in a cold or windy environment, these are for you! I highly recommend them.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,I like them! Keep your coffee hot a little warmer in cooler temperatures!,5
B0B4P7N8S7,I work in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. You cannot beat the quality and warmth you get from this product at this price. Thank you.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Excellent,5
B0B4P7N8S7,The sleeves are just a bit short but other than that they are comfortable and warm,4
B0B4P7N8S7,"I was so worried because I figured, if I buy in bulk it will lead to poorer quality, but these are like wearing thin wetsuits and I stay toasty all day in the woods. So far only been down as low as 17-degree New England weather but terrific so far! Comfy enough to sleep in as well.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,These shirts are comfortable and perfect for a base layer against the cold.  Highly recommended,5
B0B4P7N8S7,the right product at a good price!,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and ordered a Large.  While these aren't ""fitted"" shirts, they fit perfectly.  The material is suitably thick and nappy on the inside.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Very comfortable, fits well love them",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"These are everything they say as far as fit and overall quality but not as warm as more traditional waffled base layers. Also, they are super form fitting even in the correct size.",4
B0B4P7N8S7,The fit is a little looser than other brands but they are still good quality.,4
B0B4P7N8S7,I worked at a deli inside a neighborhood store and it is so cold in there especially during winter months. And these thermals are great. I've bought multiple. Highly recommend,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Muy buen producto,5
B0B4P7N8S7,I use these every day as a base layer under my patrol uniform.  Helps negate the need to wear a bulky jacket on duty.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Fast delivery!,4
B0B4P7N8S7,Perfect large for my 17 year old.. he loves the feel of it. Getting ready for the coolest winter coming soon,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Fit perfect, he loves them",4
B0B4P7N8S7,"Bought these for my 6'4"" son and the sleeves are quite a bit short. Overall fit otherwise, was great.",4
B0B4P7N8S7,These thermal compression shirts definitely kept me feeling warm and comfortable while refereeing in the cold.  Thank you,5
B0B4P7N8S7,I love love these they're very warm and comfortable the are very good quality,4
B0B4P7N8S7,I run 3 miles everyday in 40 degree temp. This shirt keeps me warm. I did not think it was going to work out. I was wrong!!,5
B0B4P7N8S7,I sit outside in the winter for my part time security guard job on weekends and just one of these under my uniform and I stay warm in 30 degree temperatures with my coat on.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"This is a extremely good product, excellent price, fast shipping. The weather where I am has already turned cold. The only thing I don't care for is how they size them",5
B0B4P7N8S7,I intentionally ordered a size up to make the fit less snug. This product says what it is and I recommend it. Definitely keeps you warm.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Great price and keeps you warm  ways cheaper then the stores easy to wash and not worry about it shrinking,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I love these, they are super warm.A great buy.I'm 6'3"" 240lbs And they fit great.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,These shirts are heavy but they are a great layer to keep warm in extreme cold Temps of ND.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,True to size and perfect material,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I'm 6'1"" and about 245. 2X fit perfectly. They hug without being tight. I wore one with a simple hoodie in mid-50 degree weather and it was all I needed. I couldn't be more pleased.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,The shirts are nice but I don't like that they were delivered in a clear bag as they are a Christmas gift and the person I bought them brought them in the house and saw what they were.,4
B0B4P7N8S7,True to size.  Good quality fabric.  Keeps hubby warm for skiing.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,This are so comfortable to wear and very warm.....great fabric quality,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Have wore these in Iceland and have no big complaints. Perfect for base layer.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,The material is nice and lightweight and good for layering. The color will not fade and they are functional at keeping you warm.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Lightweight and at the same time very warm I am loving it, it exceeded my expectations",5
B0B4P7N8S7,Really great product I like them alot,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I love the 5 pack of long sleeve fleece shirts, very warm and comfortable.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"First off, I love that they're long enough to tuck in. Thick , but not bulky. May be worth 5 stars but I've only wore this item once so far.",4
B0B4P7N8S7,"I live in the mountains, and they help keep me warm.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"He wishes there was a tag to tell front from back. They fit length wise, which is hard for us to find.",4
B0B4P7N8S7,Muy comodas,5
B0B4P7N8S7,Son muy confortables.,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Plenty warm and a great price, but I'm disappointed with the fit. It doesn't hug the body like a good base layer should. Worse the body and sleeves are short for the size. I wear medium, and I'm under six feet tall, yet the sleeves don't cover my wrists. I won't buy these again.",3
B0B4P7N8S7,"Very good quality, everything as described",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Excellent quality and thermal protection, happy with my purchase.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,This is not a 4.5 star rated product like shirts from UnderArmor (with same rating).  The price for 5 shirts is less than the price of one UA Compression shirt.  Dead give away on quality of product.,3
B0B4P7N8S7,Fit great and warm perfect for Construction.,4
B0B4P7N8S7,Excelente material,5
B0B4P7N8S7,"The product is excellent in both quality and comfort. I do a lot of walking and when the wind blows the under garment doesn't, it keeps you warm and comfortable.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Bought these for a week long camping trip in the northeast in late October and they did not disappoint. They're thin enough to be comfortably layered, they dry quickly and wick away sweat well enough, and they're super soft even after being washed. Very comfortable, stretchy, and efficient, and kept me warm on 30 degree nights.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"Great for tooling around the house in fall or winter, for exercise, of course, and the turtle neck even looks sharp as a layer under a dress shirt!A cozy multiuse garment that is very reasonably priced.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,"I bought the size 2XL and they fit great. I'm 6'1"" tall at 270 pounds. Excellent product. Really comfortable and warm.",5
B0B4P7N8S7,Definitely keeps you warm. Nice and tight against the body. Enjoy the fleece lining.,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,For working 15+ hours a day these socks are the best socks I have ever worn. They don't make my feet sweat and they are very soft. The only downside I saw was that they are not very thick socks but I personally love that because my boots fit better,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,"These socks have been durable. Unlike many socks I've bought and worn before, the heels on these have not worn through yet, and I have had them for around half a year. They are not thin, they are not thick (like winter-weight socks). They have enough bulk for prevent blisters and add a tiny bit of cushion to your step. Good socks, will likely purchase again.",4
B0CWDXJ3L2,I love these socks. They don't get holes and last a long time. They fit well and I would definitely purchase them again.,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,"I bought a pair of the same brand at a store out of state and loved how durable, comfortable & the padding they have so I decided to look for it on Amazon and found these. Same package just different color socks. Straight out the package they were soft / smooth but thin, almost no padding like the original ones. I kept them cause I needed socks but not what I thought it was.",3
B0CWDXJ3L2,"Bought these for my son. He says they keep his feet warm. They are comfortable and stay in place. They don't drop down. Good quality.  Extra material in toe and heal area, so no holes while wearing his work boots.",5
B0CWDXJ3L2,I feel the socks are comfortable but I can't tell there's any more support in the toes and heels. Pretty much feels like the same thickness all over and I wear a size 11 so I picked according size but when I pull socks up the gray part that's supposed to be under the heel pulls up behind the heel maybe I should have got the 5-8 size instead of 9-13,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,Really thin material. The cushioned parts are thinner than a normal sock.,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,The socks are warm and comfortable to wear. They are thinner than expected for work socks.,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,Great socks great price,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,Friend is on his feet in boots on concrete needs good socks these fit the bill,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,They fit perfectly with work boots,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Fits my husband perfectly. Not around his ankles like most socks,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,"There socks and the do there job. Not bad, not omg there the best thing ever, just socks",4
B0CWDXJ3L2,I got these as a gift and appear to be good quality.,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,Keeps husband's feet comfortable and warm all day,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Better than most he says comfy warm thick but not too thick,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,"I am walking around and standing for 10 to 12 hours a day, resulting in sore feet that are swollen due to all that standing.  Initially I bought these dicjs in error but finally used them.They helped with the foot pain, tight enough to stop the swelling and comfortable to wear.  In fact these are the best I've ever had.  I gave away half the socks to a friend, now I wish I kept them lol",5
B0CWDXJ3L2,"Light weight, not what I was expecting for the winter",4
B0CWDXJ3L2,A tiempo y en perfectas condiciones,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,Sock good quality but are made too small,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,These socks are thick and are great for anyone who wears boots,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,good,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Im still gonna try them out but I ordered these work socks cause I assumed WORK would be heavy duty. They are the thinnest socks I ever seen.... I needed thickness for warmth and comfortability.... Misleading product.,3
B0CWDXJ3L2,Decent quality,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,There are soft and very comfortable,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,They're not sick at all you have to double up on them they are very thin very misleading and description however they are comfortable but I did buy these because they're supposed to be warm I am keeping them because they are comfortable in the price is fair however do not buy if you think they're going to keep your feet warm,3
B0CWDXJ3L2,They fit great and feel good.,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Great thick socks for work. Very good quality,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Very comfortable. Very durable. Good price.,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,Thick,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Great socks,5
B0CWDXJ3L2,Pretty thin I was hoping they would be thicker,3
B0CWDXJ3L2,"These socks are super comfortable in work boots. I have a lot of bone pain in my left foot, and these actually help a little bit with wearing boots. I recommend them.",5
B0CWDXJ3L2,"The socks are soft and comfortable but after the first wash and I used cold water,  then put them in the dryer after,  they shrunk about 1 1/2ines in length going above the ankle ???!!!! Was not happy with that so I gave only 3 stars",3
B0CWDXJ3L2,Warm but not bulky good for working out,4
B0CWDXJ3L2,From the marketing material in the ad it appears to be a heavy duty work sock NO just thin tight socks that will probably be trash this time next year . I give up on Amazon,3
B07S2D47L8,"I got this for my SO for Christmas and it was definitely a win! Fit perfect, he loved the extra pockets and the things added to make it more comfortable for working, and it is very warm! The color was great for his taste and with Carrhart you know you're getting a quality product!",5
B07S2D47L8,"I was conflicted between the small and medium size, but I took a chance on the small, even know I normally wear mediums in hoodies and other jackets.I based my size off of a Wrangler work jacket I recieved last year for Christmas that was a size medium. Unfortunately, that jacket was a bit too big, for the sleeves went far past my wrists and the shoulder seams went too far past the end of my shoulder. It felt too bulky as well.So for this Carharrt I took a chance on the size small and didn't regret it. It fit perfect; the shoulder seams lined up and the sleeves covered my wrists perfectly. The length was good as well without it extending too low below my hips. I was even able to wear my favorite hoodie underneath it without the jacket feeling constrained and arm movement still feeling spacious.Keep in mind I have a relatively small frame, anyway so your mileage may vary.I asked my dad to try the jacket on, who is an inch shorter than me and has a more athletic build with slightly bigger shoulders, and it fit him perfect as well.The jacket itself feels high quality and will definitely hold up to some wear and the sherpa will definitely keep you warm. It's now probably the best jacket I've ever owned with plenty of pockets and a lightweight feel to the overall coat.Highly recommend if your considering it, for it is a solid alternative if the Detroit jacket lacks too little features for you.",5
B07S2D47L8,"I love this jacket. I've had it for a few months now and use it almost daily in the winter here in NY and it's been a cold winter, this jacket keeps me warmer than any other I have owned in the past. It feels durable and is clearly well made. I'm 6'1 so I ordered the tall version and it's a perfect fit. Was expensive but your not just paying for the name brand, it's the quality of the jacket that's worth that extra price.",5
B07S2D47L8,"Always great for work and keeps you warm. Durable material! Will buy more. True to size, nice dark brown color. Loads of pockets. It is a bit heavy but with how warm it is and the fabric is wind resistant,  it's worth it",5
B07S2D47L8,"Tuff Jacket and warm too, also looks good and fits well.",5
B07S2D47L8,"Heavy duty, comfortable coat. We live in 1 of the snowiest cities and it keeps my hubby warm while out in the freezing temps. The quality is good, the color matches the pics, multiple pockets inside and out the coat. He's 6ft and 175lbs. I initially got him a LG but had to return and get the LG Tall because it was too short in the front. So I highly recommend getting the tall size if your over 5'10",5
B07S2D47L8,"This one hits all the important points for me! Got one in brown, and another for my son in gravel. Top attributes: 1) super durable and tough face fabric with the 12 oz duck canvas, 2) fit is not too much of a relaxed fit - it is not baggy (compared to other Carhartt products in same size where extra fabric just gets in the way of actual work use), 3) decent warmth and comfort with the sherpa lining (but don't expect it to keep you as warm as a puffer), 4) useful chest pockets for phone, pens, knife, and 5) overall good design that balances function and style. Low attributes, but not terrible: 1) heavy and bulky, 2) hood is just a tad too big, 3) mmm, nothing else noteworthy!",5
B07S2D47L8,"I am totally pleased with this jacket.  Although I am a (L) large size, I generally order jackets one size larger because I like having a bit of extra room.  Having worn BDUs in the military for a number of years, I've grown accustomed to having clothing being a bit larger than needed.  It's just a comfort thing.  Anyway, other reviewers of this jacket suggested ordering one size smaller than what one would normally wear because these tend to run a bit large.  Heeding this advice, I ordered the Large Tall version (I am 6""2"" and about 175 lbs).  I should have listened to my instinct and bought the XL Tall.The L Tall just did not give me quite the room that I prefer.  No matter though.  I sent it back and got the XL Tall.  It's great.  The quality of this jacket is pure Carhartt through and through.  It's very well made and geared for heavy use. The sleeve length is perfect and I have plenty of room throughout.  The pockets are deep and the snaps are tight and secure.  The lining is very soft and comfortable, and the hood adjusts nicely.  The only issue I have is that the zipper is a bit on the small side and a bit taxing to use until one gets the hang of it.  I have used Carhartt products for years because their quality has always been above reproach.  Although I prefer Carhartt products made in North America, this was made in India, which I find tolerable because it is so well made.  All things considered, I am extremely happy with this jacket and can recommend it without reservation.  God bless America and our troops!",5
B07S2D47L8,"I completely like the jacket, I read the reviews and still wasn't sure what size to get, I ordered a XL but probably should have gotten a Large, that is one of the things I dislike about buying apparel online,  It should serve me well for years to come.  Can this product be exchanged for a Large ?  Update,  Returned this Jacket today 1/26/2025 because they didn't have a way to exchange it!  I'll see how that goes, I sent it back in the original box though I taped it up better than I received it, then I ordered a Large I think will fit better.  If the return experience is a bad one I will update again so to save anyone else a headache.",5
B07S2D47L8,I had the walls jacket for like 20 yrs now and still good jack. Bought this jacket and like it better. It's not to heavy or binding. Believe this jacket will last me the rest of my life here on earth lol. Really like the layout of pockets. Sprayed it to keep me dry when fishing. I would recommend this style jacket.,5
B07S2D47L8,"So I where a a 4xl shirt. But I'm in the process of dieting and losing weight. So I figured I should size down so I was going to get the 3xl. Then I seen the ""3xl big"" and I decided to get that because i was worried the normal 3xl wouldnt fit yet. I should of just went with the 3xl. The ""big"" is fine for length but i got a ton of extra room in the circumference. I feel like a kid wearing his dad's coat lol. This is my fault for not understanding sizes. The product itself is great. Keeps you warm. Good quality. I definitely recommend.",5
B07S2D47L8,"my 'mechanic"" son loves Carhartt in general.Good product.. very well made.. long lastingactually an investment because of the longevity of the itemLoves the jacket but wishes they could make them a little bit less stiffas for sizing, you're not on the runway wear the size you can work in . in this case xl about 178lbs-no belly",5
B07S2D47L8,"This is an upgrade from my old Carhartt jacket. I like the pleated shoulders, all the pockets, the cuffs, the sherpa lining and you can't beat duck material for durability. This is a great jacket.",5
B07S2D47L8,"The quality of this jacket is amazing. Just like anything Carhartt makes, it's built to last. That being said, I purchased a small and it was too small.Every jacket I own is a size small, and they fit perfectly- including my other Carhartt jacket. For some reason, this one did not fit well. It's heavy duty, and I really thought about just keeping it and trying to make it work, but it wasn't comfortable to wear.Not only that, I would have only been able to wear a t-shirt underneath it. I needed it for outdoor workwear during the winter. I will consider ordering it again in a medium. I think that would allow me to be able to wear a hoodie underneath. It's an awesome jacket despite the weird fit of the small.",5
B07S2D47L8,My husband loves this jacket. It keeps him warm in these freezing temps while he works outside and he looks good doing it! Large pockets and adds a nice touch. Carhart always makes quality clothing. Would definitely purchase again.,5
B07S2D47L8,"This thing is so nice, so warm. Highest quality jacket. I've ever had you can go out. Below 0 weather and it will keep you warm. It is the warmest jacket. You can buy definitely recommend.",5
B07S2D47L8,Will be good when it is very cold out,5
B07S2D47L8,"This jacket is 100% worth it, It fits perfectly the hood is nice has a ton of pockets on the inside and outside.",5
B07S2D47L8,Amazing my boyfriend loved it and I love it on him,5
B07S2D47L8,"This is a good and warm coat overall. The side pockets are far too shallow/small to even keep your hands in and things tend to fall out of them. Engaging the zipper is also a problem, with very little material on either side if the zipper and the coat to grasp while closing it. Zipper receiver is also placed at an angle instead of vertical, making it harder to engage. Minor issues that the manufacturer could easily correct if he wanted to.",4
B07S2D47L8,Hubby wore it to bed,5
B07S2D47L8,Fits Great.Tough as nails.Warm enough for winter.,5
B07S2D47L8,"This is a high quality coat.  The fabric is extremely durable and actually pretty warm for what it is.  Its really heavy.  No light-weight cheap coat here! Also, what I found cool and have never seen before, is the the adjustable plastic things that tighten and loosen the hood and waist, for the hood, they are hidden inside it.  You can feel it in the hood when adjusting.  Smart.This coat would have recieved 5 stars if the wool insulation went into the sleeves as well.  It's only in the hood and torso area.  That and the zipper doesn't seem like it'll last long.  When it fails, it can be buttoned up at least.  Would I buy again in the future and recommend?  Hell yes!",4
B07S2D47L8,"I'm glad I read the reviews,  I never order tall, but I absolutely would not fit a regular length for this coat.I'm 6'1"", 175lbs and the large tall fits perfect.  It's not too big to wear with just a t shirt, there's enough room to fit a hoodie under it.  Length ends right at my belt line.Not as warm as your average ski jacket, but it is heavy and looks durable.  I'll update the review if it doesn't hold up well.",5
B07S2D47L8,"First impressions are very good. Super warm, comfortable, and medium tall fits perfect on me (5'11, 175lbs) I prefer longer fit because it covers my lower back when riding my motorcycle. I was concerned the non sherpa sleeves would be cold like most jackets but not on this one. Arms got warm really fast and stayed that way. The only thing I don't like is the cuffs are super tight out of the box, but I'm sure they'll loosen up after use. It's also a hair/lint magnet but they remove super easy compared to other materials. This is hands down the best jacket I've ever owned.",5
B07S2D47L8,"Front is short compared to any other XL-sized coat/jacket I own, including two other Carhartts.  It is not possible atm to cinch the waist cord tight enough to prevent air infiltration.  Perhaps it will be possible once jacket is broken in???  The regular XL fits my long arms perfectly.  I might try an XL-tall, but they did not provide any information about how much longer the arms would be.",4
B07S2D47L8,Nice high quality. Thick enough for winter.,5
B07S2D47L8,"6'2"" 280lbs with larger belly than I would like. Typically order and wear 3XL. Based on another review, these run large. Order 2XL and it fits perfect! Also, sleeves long where sleeves typically run short for me. Recommend.",5
B07S2D47L8,Fits my son perfect. He loves it.,5
B07S2D47L8,"Perfect fit( especially for long arms ), color, very warm for cold winter, and well made.",5
B07S2D47L8,"Great fit and great quality jacket, love it",5
B07S2D47L8,I gave it a 5 star rating because the coat is really nice . But it run small . So what ever size you are thinking about getting . Get a size bigger,5
B07S2D47L8,I love the jacket been getting compliments from day one,5
B07S2D47L8,Really enjoy this jacketWarm and great qualityA bit more dressy than a conventional work jacket,5
B07S2D47L8,"Bought a small for my son who has a small build at 5'8 120lbs and it is small,  he always where's a small in everything but I think a medium would have been better for him. Length is short, sleeves barely hit the wrists.",4
B07S2D47L8,Ordered another one.  Impressive quality.  Made in India.,5
B07S2D47L8,"Could have sized down to a 3x but I like my clothing roomy to move and layer. Best jacket, super warm. Gonna be wearing this forever",5
B07S2D47L8,It would be nice for those shopping for Carhart coats to know the level of warmth from each jacket prior to purchase! The one we got is great! BUT level 2 warmth. Level 4 is the warmest and would've been our pick had we known,4
B07S2D47L8,Nice heavy jacket. Looks good and is comfortable.  I went a size up for my son and it's perfect.,5
B07S2D47L8,It fits true to size.  It is warm. It does let air up through the bottom on your stomach but that is expected  The outside material is not real stiff and I like that. It is a carhartt so I think it will last for years to come. Yes I would buy it again and I do recommend it,5
B07S2D47L8,"The jacket is warm, fits true to size, and is made from quality materials. Carhartt never disappoints!",5
B07S2D47L8,Nice heavy jacket. Priced cheaper on Amazon than a few local places. Husband likes this coat. True to size and warm.,5
B07S2D47L8,Feels very nice. A good layer of insulation without feeling like I'm being weighed down by a massive coat. Could wear this in anything from the 20 degrees to the 60's and still be comfortable.,5
B07S2D47L8,"I was SO HAPPY and relieved to receive this safe and sound at MY DOOR !!!  I Have had some trouble in the past receiving my packages ( delivered to the wrong place or wrong door or SOMEWHERE I can't find and that is IF IT WAS INSEES DELIVERED ) but you have restored my faith .  Thank You So much .  It is here and folded nicely and in good shape and ready to wrap for X-Mas .  Let's hope he likes it as much as I do !!Sincerely ,Karla",4
B07S2D47L8,Perfect fit!,5
B07S2D47L8,Love the jacket  great  thank you,5
B07S2D47L8,It's perfect ....great quality well worth the cost,5
B07S2D47L8,High quality coat and very warm.  I should have read the product description closer pertaining to the fit. Very loose in the back and let's a lot of cold air in from the back. I should have bought the version with the tighter fitting waist,4
B07S2D47L8,"I have been a Carhartt fan for years, and I purchased the Utility Jacket to replace my 26 year old Carhartt chore coat.What do I like about this jacket: Everything.The Fit: I am 5ft 11in tall, 185lbs, Medium build, so I ordered a Large, and the fit is perfect from the sleeve length to the shoulders. Because the jacket is gusseted, it allows for full range of motion even with the jacket fully zipped and buttoned. The jacket has an adjustable waste cord, which I have not had to touch. Another nice feature is the jacket length, which falls at pocket level on a pair of jeans. The jacket is slightly longer in the back than in the front, which keeps it from riding up.Storage: The jacket has six pockets. Two front ""hand"" pockets, two buttoned breast pockets, an additional front left breast pocket with a center Velcro closure, which makes for a handy place to hold pencils, and an interior zip pocket on the left, which I use to keep my wallet secure. Pocket depth has not been an issue, and I keep an IPhone 13 in the front hand pocket with no issues.Warmth: The jacket is Sherpa lined. I've worn it hours in 25-32 degree temps and was comfortable with just a T-shirt under a Henley shirt. I would say that it would be comfortable to work in from 20-50 degrees. The zipper (right zipper) also has a button cover, making it that much more air tight. The sleeves are cuffed, though they don't appear to be at a glance. These cuffs really help with keeping cold air from seeping into the arms, especially if you're like me and you like to wear a thinner undershirt while working. There is a Sherpa-lined attached hood as well.Construction: This jacket feels heavy duty. The zipper is beefy, the buttons solid, and the overall construction is solid. I feel like I can use and abuse this jacket without destroying it. The duck outer lining is not soft cotton, but it moves, and feels strong without being stiff.Appearance: This is not a bad looking jacket and I might even call it stylish. I would feel fine wearing this while out and about.Demerits. I give this jacket one demerit, and it is a very minor demerit, and that is the attached hood. I like the hood, I like how it lays on the back when not in use without feeling bulky, I just wish that it could be removed. This is a very minor quibble, however.Overall I highly recommend this jacket if you are in the market for warm, heavy duty, and practical work wear. It is not inexpensive, but I feel it is worth every penny. In fact, I would go as far to say that even if you aren't in the market for a work jacket, but only warm jacket that can take a beating, then this jacket is worth considering. It is warm, comfortable, practical, and not bad looking.",5
B07S2D47L8,He loves this coat but says he should have definitely got a 4 for the winter months. Also got this when it was only like $150. So that was nice.,4
B07S2D47L8,Love it. Warm and super comfortable. Easy to layer underneath without the fabric catching in the arms like some coats.,5
B07S2D47L8,"Strong material, seems unlikely to tear easily. Fits as expected.",5
B07S2D47L8,This jacket is great for people who love to work outside in the cold. This is a big jacket with Sherpa inside.,5
B07S2D47L8,Jacket arrived three days after ordering even though original estimate was a week. Jacket itself is exactly what you'd expect from Carhartt. Quality jacket that will last.,5
B07S2D47L8,I will be keeping this jacket forever. I love the pocket placement and the thickness. I used this jacket along with a sweater underneath to replace my entire Tahoe's front suspension in 30 degree wet weather on my driveway. I also was sliding in and out underneath the car on rough concreate and the material does not show any signs of wear. Good job Carhartt!,5
B07S2D47L8,This jacket is amazing. Keeps me so warm outside. Love it,5
B07S2D47L8,Wish I would of gone with a larger size but other then that is really warm,4
B07S2D47L8,"As someone who HATES being cold, I love this jacket! It keeps me warm through wind and rain. I should have purchased this sooner!",5
B07S2D47L8,"This jacket is amazing. Warm-ish but doesn't overheat (currently 40-65F where I live), the gusseted arms make it really flexible, the fit is impeccable, it boosted my testosterone 322% and I subsequently packed on 15lbs of lean muscle in the first week of wearing it. My wife might even start loving me again because this jacket looks so good (fingers crossed). Dig the pockets. Highly recommend.SIZING: I'm 6'1"" and180lbs, and the Medium *Tall* fits perfectly.",5
B07S2D47L8,"Fits true to size, super warm and looks great",5
B07S2D47L8,Great quality and he looks so good in it!,5
B07S2D47L8,My husband says this is the warmest coat he's ever owned. It looks great on him too,5
B07S2D47L8,Grandson couldnt find a jacket he liked. Showed him this one and he liked it. It fit good and looks good on him. Good price for a carhartt.,5
B07S2D47L8,we love it !,5
B07S2D47L8,"Bought for my husband, he loves it. Fits true to size.",5
B07S2D47L8,Husband loves it,5
B07S2D47L8,Gave as a Christmas gift they loved it!!!,5
B07S2D47L8,Best coat by far.,5
B07S2D47L8,Very well made,5
B07S2D47L8,Jackie fix me this jacket fits me very well,5
B07S2D47L8,I loved the inside this jacket very warm. Good quality jacket. My son loves it for them cold nights at work. Perfect fit!!,5
B07S2D47L8,"Fits like a glove - site suggest sizing down which is accurate, and like the cotton wrist bands on sleeves. Item has plenty of well placed pockets and is weather resistant enough for my needs. Material is waterproof duct with a comfortable fleece lining so is not too hot in mild weather",5
B07S2D47L8,"I grabbed this jacket for my husband as a surprise and he's been super happy with it. He was already a big fan of Carhartt products, but this jacket may have pushed him into super fan territory. We're in Northern Minnesota and he routinely wears this jacket while completing his farm chores. He reports that it's warm, perfect for layering, waterproof and doesn't hinder his ability to get stuff done as it fits him perfectly through the shoulders, which has been a problem with other jackets. From my perspective, it's easy to clean, is made from outstanding materials, has an excellent zipper and I love the color on him. Win-win!",5
B07S2D47L8,"Living in northern Michigan, the Winters are extremely cold.  This jacket is great for hunting, wearing casual, or whatever.  This is by far the warmest coat I have ever owned, I recommend buying!!!!",5

B01C3B6020,"Comfy, true to size, thick and warm, great product for the price",5
B01C3B6020,"The quality is unmatched.  The first thing i did was wash and dry it to see if it would shrink.  It didn't shrink at all.  I am 6'2"" and 245.  I carry most of my weight in my torso.  I usually wear an XL Tall if i can but most of the time it is hard to find the Tall option.  And that leads me to ordering a lot of XXL clothing that is often too big but I have to for the length, etc.  I ordered the XL Tall and had to return for a Large Tall which fit perfect.  I never wear a large in any clothing so I would probably recommend sizing down one size.  Returns are simply with Prime, not sure about non-Prime accounts.  These are quite simply the best quality sweatshirts I have ever bought.  They are a bit on the pricy side but the quality cannot be disputed.  I paid $69.99 and I love them so much, I bought 3 .  They do great in rain though you don't want to treat them as rain gear.  They are rain repellant so you want to limit your rain exposure but the rain is repelled quite well... basically you can get from A to B and not get wet through the shirt.  I may buy back ups in all the colors I already have.  They are that good.Side note:  These are heavy grade material.  They are not super soft like all cotton sweatshirts. They are NOT overly stiff but expect them to be stiffer than your regular low cost sweatshirts.  These are made for durability and they seem like they will be very durable indeed.  Still very very comfortable.",5
B01C3B6020,"Great price, fast service. My son is an electrician, Carhartt is his favorite for warmth , durability and fit. This heavy weight is his favorite for winter work. Put a pair of insulated Carhartt bibs under it and your set n",5
B01C3B6020,Wow wow wow!!! I will tell you this is the best hoodie I have ever bought!!! The moment I purchased it everyone around me said nice hoodie where you get it? How much was it? Seems comfortable! I don't review clothes because I am not a fashion person. But I will say most comfortable and best looking one I have.,5
B01C3B6020,"Absolutely love this hoodie, very heavy almost can replace a coat it's quite warm. My line of work destroys clothes but we all know the quality of Carhartt. Can't recommend this hoodie enough.",5
B01C3B6020,"This loose cover hoodie is perfect for PNW weather, respells the water during misty and fogy days, provides a nice layer of warmth, very durable and color does not fade after multiple washes.",5
B01C3B6020,"Love the fit and finish of this sweatshirt, it is a 1/4 zip with a collar. With the hood down it fits like a sweatshirt with no hood, very comfortable. I liked it so much I ordered a navy blue one as well.",5
B01C3B6020,I work emergency services and this is a better option than the 5.11 job shirt because of the hood. Very professional and perfect for indoors and outdoors. And repels water perfectly.,5
B01C3B6020,"Fits true to size, thicker than a normal hoodie but not to heavy. I like the way it looks in black and i like the way it feels and was thinking of getting another one in a different color.",5
B01C3B6020,This is his 3rd one. Loves this sweatshirts. Stores did not have any in stock where he goes  but Amazon did,5
B01C3B6020,"This is easily my favorite hoodie. Thick material, very warm, snug fit.",5
B01C3B6020,"It's supposed to fit loose but it still runs a little big, I am 6 feet tall 205 pounds and a medium fits me very loose. It's very well-made and very heavy material",5
B01C3B6020,"The person who I bought this for is 6'5"" and 215 pounds, so typically he is an XL tall in anything, and that's what I ordered. It was too long in both the body and the sleeves. This sweatshirt is a very generous cut, so don't size up!  We ordered a L tall and it was perfect! It is an awesome sweatshirt. He says it seems durable, he loves the quarter zip hoodie style, and it's super comfortable.  Buy it!",5
B01C3B6020,Very nice i love this sweater exactly what I expected.recommend  for sure.came just as described no issues. Not to het another for my brother.,5
B01C3B6020,Bought as gift and they love it. Says it's the best hoodie out there. Great for cold weather and it's nice and soft but durable. Highly recommend.,5
B01C3B6020,Very comfortable and fits just right,5
B01C3B6020,"My boyfriend is a waterman - he LOVES this particular sweatshirt, and said it's the nicest one he's ever owned - so I got it for him in green. He also hunts, so this will be a nice color to blend in with the outdoors. It's less bright in person than the pictures, I feel. Get it for your man, they'll LOVE it! It's also very heavyweight.",5

B01C3B6020,"My son bought me the Carhartt Men's Rain Defender Loose Fit Heavyweight Sweatshirt and it is the best 3 season hoodie I own. I ordered the quarter zip sweatshirts for both of my boys this year. I also bought one for myself and will likely buy a couple more colors. I wore this the other night walking the dog, figuring when I got cold we would turn back (it was 36 f ) 1.5 miles later we got home and I was still toasty. Stands up well to rain too.",5
B01C3B6020,"Good fit, nice quality",5
B01C3B6020,great presents.,5
B01C3B6020,fits well,5
B01C3B6020,This is the only brand of sweatshirt my husband will wear and this one is the half zip up which he has been wanting and he loves it. So comfy for him,5
B01C3B6020,"Most sweat shirts now are light to mid weight.  I wanted a heavy weight shirt that I could wear without having to put a coat on over it.  This seemed like the shirt.Purchased this in blue, gray, and silver.  The ones I got  are thick and warm.  Definately heavyweight.  However, I cannot recommend them cause they are not durable.  Washed per instructions and two ""pilled"" and ""balled"" so bad.  Gray has so much pulling I don't wanna wear it out.  Silver looks rough too, but not quite as bad.  Blue is not that bad yet.  Only worn and washed 2-3 times.They are good for outside activities (work and play) where you want warmth but not bulky outerwear.  Wear over a base layer and your good to go.I also like the tight fitting neck.  Kinda serves as a gaiter and keeps the wind out.  It also fits good and the sleeves are also not too short like most sweats.I have had these a couple months but have not tested the water resistance so I cannot speak on that.I rank it a 3 cause if your looking for a warm work shirt and dont mind the pilling this would be fine.  Just won't be able to wear as a non-work shirt due to all the pilling.",3
B01C3B6020,"I bought this in 2 colors for my husband. They are just a bit bigger than I expected, but that's fine for him. They are very heavy and warm and have a thick hood. We live in ND, so our winters are bitterly cold. This will definitely be very good for those negative temps. If you live in a cold area, I would definitely recommend.",5
B01C3B6020,"Very excellent product, thankful that Amazon carries this.",5
B01C3B6020,"Nice hoody; warm, nice material- worth the money",5
B01C3B6020,He loved the sweatshirt and it was very good quality! I bought another one in a different color because it was so nice and warm .,5
B01C3B6020,love it thats all I can truly say. Keeps you warm,5
B01C3B6020,"I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and stylish sweatshirt. It definitely lives up to the Carhartt reputation for quality!",5
B01C3B6020,I have 4 grown grandsons with very different style preferences and have frequently been unsuccessful in gift giving with them. I bought each of them one of these ultra warm and well liked coats. They all LOVED them and even posed for pictures together! It was a win. Great value!,5
B01C3B6020,If you work outside this is an excellent hoodie !,5
B01C3B6020,I got this for my husband and did a heat transfer design on it. It's heavyweight and loose fitting! I put it on top of a loose fit standard hoodie from carhartt we already had to compare sizes just in case (since I was personalizing and didn't want him to see it to try it on) and it's actually a tad larger than the regular hoodie. Wouldn't hesitate to buy again!,5
B01C3B6020,"Runs big so down a size, plenty of room even down sizing to layer. Rainproof is great and works well. I love this hoodie, as a trucker I would recommend! I like wearing it on high precipitation days, keeps me warm, dry, and looks nice.",5

B01C3B6020,Comfortable and warm. I bought more.,5
B01C3B6020,"I have several of the regular heavyweight rain defender sweatshirts and love them. Wanted this one though as it leaves more room in the neck and doesn't feel like it's choking you (which I think the regular ones do sometimes).This one also feels like it has a larger hood, which is nice.",5
B000KGOHLM,"This is my 2nd purchase of this hat, however, I will tell you why at the end of my review, since this this is supposed to be a review for the item itself and not necessarily just about why I purchased the hat.This Hat would actually be a great warm winter Hat for those SD, ND, MN, WI, NY, PA, etc Type winters.As a Man, this is a great winter Hat that fits great and as expected. It actually exceeded my expectations, especially for the fit and wear & tear you will put it through, as it is a Carhartt. Carhartt means, it was made to be USED and not just worn.  Any man will know the difference between wearing something and actually using it.I have about a Medium size to slightly medium-large sized head. Medium because of the shape and size of my head is Medium like anyone else with a medium sized head.  However, the large part is because the vertical length of my head is slightly longer.  Kind of like your shoe size may really be a size 10, however because you may have wide feet you have to get a size 11 just to accommodate the width, if a size 10W isn't available.If you're looking for a Medium sized hat with a little bit of length to it, then this would be the hat to get.Realistically, the hat is slightly a little bigger because of the length and its new.  However for a Man, it's always good to purchase a hat that is slightly bigger than what you presumably need, because you never know what your going to be stuck doing, like a lot of shoveling or out scraping cars when it's ice cold out and you need that extra part/length of the hat to cuff and cover your ears really well to keep them warm and protected.If you put this hat on all the way w/o cuffing it, and wear/pull it all the way down until there is no more to material to pull down, it will reach to about the base of the head/neck, with still a little slack left over.In terms of long term use and durability, this is also another reason why I love this hat.  As it does have slightly a little extra slack to it.  Depending on your purpose, occupation or whatever the heck you'll be doing that you'll be wearing this hat, it can be adjusted in many different positions.You'll also more than likely you'll end up putting it in the wash.  When you wash this hat, I highly recommend washing it only with other winter type articles of clothing, or maybe a small load of shirts or sweaters at most.  Yes, you could wash it with just a regular full load of laundry or anything else, but I don't recommend it if you want this hat to last a long time. Like anything else in this life, If you take care of it, it will take care of you. The best way to dry it would either be to throw it in the dryer for 5 minutes at the most and let it hang dry. However, if you want to dry it in the dryer all the way, put it on very light heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or just let the dryer run on air dry with no heat for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you drive too much, that will get more worn Out and used then if you were wearing and using it yourself, which means it won't last long.This is my 2nd year purchasing this exact hat, as I still have the 1st hat from last year.  Except this time/year, I purchased 2 more from Amazon.The 1st hat was purchased at a retail location.  Then I found it online at Amazon for a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant at 1st, because the price on Amazon was substantially lower.  However, when I received these from Amazon, upon further examination, it was the same exact one that I purchased at retail.I purchased additonally hats because I have a habit of losing them. When you find a product or item that works well, especially a winter hat, it's a good idea to purchase a few extra ones.If you lose the only one that you have or if you've really got some really good use out of the one that you have had for a long time and you know it's more than likely it's time for you to throw it out, you know it's going to be close to impossible to find another one again that works exactly like the one that you had and grown accustom to that you know that works. We all know that all good things come to an end  it don't last forever. Then before you know it, your stuck having to go from store to store (site-to-site) to try to find a hat that fits or is comfortable, especially in the middle of winter when you just lost your hat. To top it off, you can no longer find that same exact hat. I've been through that before and it sucks.So in closing this is a very good hat, because of the good comfortable fit, durability, longevity and that It will take good care of you; and especially for the price.  You can't beat the price for the brand that you're getting which also makes it easier to buy extra hats.If you're going to buy extra hats, I recommend buying at least 2 or 3 extra or total of 3 or 4 hats. 1 hat for obvious reasons; an extra 1 at home in case you lose 1, 1 extra one for in your car under your seat in case you forget your hat or lose it while you're out and abou, that way you have an extra one in the car when you need it.  Also, 1 hat left at work.  The extra hats in the car or at work also serve a great purpose for helping somebody else out that may not have a hat that clearly needs one.",5
B000KGOHLM,My Brother loves his beanie. Fits perfect. Keeps him warm. Matches his carhart gloves and jacket.  He looks sharp and stays warm. Easy to wash.,5
B000KGOHLM,"I love this hat. It fits well, provides warmth, and is stylish.",5
B000KGOHLM,"Great fit, a little bit stiff but I expect that will change with time, but still very comfortable and warm if it stays this way.I'm a 6.2 300+ big guy. Most beanies like this have at least one if not more of the following issues 1) One size fits all ... yea no 2) Not long enough to protect my ears or 3) In the rare cases they don't have those issues they are so thin that can't keep the front flipped up out of my eyes.",5

B000KGOHLM,"As I've gotten older, I find that I am less cold tolerant, so I asked my neighbors who had just moved in from Wyoming what brands they wear.  You guessed it, Carhartt was one of the brands.  So I've gotten a nice thick hoodie and now this knit hat.  It is warm!  And even though it's a men's hat, it fits me well (and i don't have a big head).  Love its visibility on foggy days when I go for a walk.",5
B000KGOHLM,"This hat fits my head perfectly. It's snug and warm but without being tight and keeps my ears covered. Did I say warm? It's better than a Columbia hat I purchased recently. Warm, soft material, snug fit , breathable. I recommend it.",5

When I find something of good value & sturdy, I tend to stick with it.Carhartt hasn't failed me yet & like I said, I've been wearing Carhartt for over 30 years.",5

B000KGOHLM,This was bought as a Christmas present for my sister and she loves it. The color is a nice creamy white and has washed well. I would say it would mess up hair when taking it off but if kept on it looks good. She said it fits nice with no issues with feeling tight on her head,5

B000KGOHLM,The hat looks really nice. Color was good. The ft was a bit tight but it's new so it may stretch a bit with wear. It's not too thick but not thin either. I don't know how it will do in the washer but I'm sure it will hold up. Probably better to wash it by hand.,5
B000KGOHLM,The soft material is very comfortable. Very warm for the top of your head and to pull down over your ears. Blocks the wind from blowing in your ears.,5

B087C8WB2M,These are always his favorite. They are soft and comfy and cooling. They always allow you to gain or lose a few lbs too.,5

B087C8WB2M,"These are great. They feel and fit very well. However, one of the pairs had a small rip in it. Otherwise, these are fantastic for the money.",4
B087C8WB2M,Comodos,5
B087C8WB2M,The fabric is spandex. The stitching has been done very neatly. It is well-made. The fit is good and it is very comfortable. Bear in mind that it is spandex and not for hot weather. In cool weather it is just fine.,4
B087C8WB2M,My son loves the material and fit of these boxers,5
B087C8WB2M,"Actually quite impressed with these. I have always been someone who bought garments from walmart, thinking that this Calvin Klein stuff was more fashion than function. But no these are my go to now! Super soft, doesnt itch when I sit for long periods of time, and has lots of room where its needed. If they ever go on sale, it's certainly worth it!",5
B087C8WB2M,Nice drawers. Comfy.,4
B087C8WB2M,My husband was pleased with his briefs. They fit comfortably and serve a good purpose. The fit is great.,5
B087C8WB2M,But there is no fly. I seldom wear them.,3
B087C8WB2M,Super comfy and cute got this as a V day gift and it was a hit,5
B087C8WB2M,Nice and flexible,5
B087C8WB2M,La calidad de la tela.,5
B087C8WB2M,"I wear a size 32 waist in most jeans and pants. I also usually get size medium for my boxer briefs. I will say the fit is very good, almost feels like nothing is on haha. Jokes aside, these calvin klein boxer briefs provide tons of support and stylish at the same time.",5
B087C8WB2M,Best underware,5
B087C8WB2M,"Got them. I like them but the quality was not what I was waiting for. I was hoping better quality product! They are too light and almost transparent. I was hoping getting them like one I had before which someone stole it from me at the gym. The old one I had was thicker, strong, and much better quality. Now guys, tell me the truth: this is really KELVIN KLINE product. I found it very simple and not the material quality I was hoping for. Very disappointed with the material quality. Kelvin Kline made stuff is getting that bad? I will not buy it again!",2
B087C8WB2M,Good fitting briefs but no hole for a man to relieve himself,3
B087C8WB2M,Comfortable underwear,5
B087C8WB2M,Calvin Klein underwear is always very jumbling made have great colors and just make you overall feel generally sexy and wearing them every day,5
B087C8WB2M,They're ok,3
B087C8WB2M,"It deserved a 5 star if the size was accurate. For an extra large, it is too tight unlike other brands.Buy one size up and it fits better.",4
B087C8WB2M,"I love these calvins, they feel amazing for working out",5
B087C8WB2M,"Great looking and fit well, they don't last very long before holes begin to show in the fabric.  I like them but am disappointed in the durability.",4
B087C8WB2M,Muy buen producto excelente calidad,5
B087C8WB2M,"Briefs are soft, durable and fit comfortably. My husband says like wearing nothing",5
B087C8WB2M,I really hate online shopping for clothes but these were a great purchase. They are extremely soft and retain their elasticity after several washes. They offer great support and do not tend to ride up the thigh like some other brands. I purchased the all black and they have retained their dark color without fading. Would definitely purchase again.,4
B087C8WB2M,Great purchase good price.,5
B087C8WB2M,They are soft and fit really nice. I think value for money is definitely there.,5
B087C8WB2M,Los recomiendo 100%,5
B087C8WB2M,"These stretch and after very soft & comfortable. However, first paid i ordered came in opened and already worn, these are underwear! Gross! I returned those and got a new pair which had a hole after washing once.I wish I could rate these well but the quality just is not there.",2
B087C8WB2M,"Satisfecho con el producto, comodos, acorde a lo que buscaba.",5
B087C8WB2M,Comfy!!! Not a bad price for three pair! I could have got a size smaller. Not sure why a waist of 34 would need an XL (my only gripe).,4
B087C8WB2M,I bought a seven pack of these in the past and really like them. Had them so long that I needed some more. Fit great long-lasting very durable nothing to dislike.,5
B087C8WB2M,Love these boxers.,5
B087C8WB2M,My husband really likes them,5
B087C8WB2M,Buen producto,5
B087C8WB2M,I like the underwear but wish the legs part was 3 or 4 inches longer.,3
B087C8WB2M,"Nice, easy to wash, seems to be durable",5
B087C8WB2M,True to size and great fit,4
B087C8WB2M,Muy buenos pero llegaron sin empaque ni nada,3
B087C8WB2M,These are the best underwear I've ever used. Awesome for day to day and running,5
B087C8WB2M,Muy buenos!,5
B087C8WB2M,"I unfortunately did not look closely enough before ordering these, they are 88% polyester. You know what is a hot, heavy material that does not breathe well at all and retains heat? Polyester. Needless to say this is not ideal for underwear.If you like a swampy feeling when wearing underwear, this is the product for you. If not, you should probably get cotton underwear, because it breathes and is lighter.",2
B087C8WB2M,Love the feel and look to these. 100% recommend. Great value.,5
B087C8WB2M,Underwear is very comfortable and fit well,5
B087C8WB2M,I like Hanes better than these,3
B087C8WB2M,Smells really bad after a work out compared to cotton or modal,3
B087C8WB2M,He insisted he was only a medium but large fit him perfectly. Nice quality.,5
B087C8WB2M,"Sure these are soft, but I tossed them because they have no front access. I don't sit down to pee and I'm too lazy to unbutton at the urinal or pull myself out through the leg hole to urinate. Maybe some of these have front access but the ones I got did not. A shame too because they are otherwise good, albeit a bit long.",2
B087C8WB2M,I personally would not be writing this review if my Son was not purchasing these briefs all the time! Young men are particularly sensitive to the brand they use. Mom has previously purchased this brand for her partner!,5
B087C8WB2M,Love these for active wear - wicks away heat and ultra comfy. My lady like 'em too (:{),5
B087C8WB2M,washes well and do not shrink if you dry with light heat,5
B087C8WB2M,"They are soft but it is too tight, I would suggest sizing up.",3
B087C8WB2M,Fits as expected. Very comfortable and easy to wear.,4
B087C8WB2M,Cannot recommend this enough. Really really comfortable,5
B087C8WB2M,My BF love this!,5
B087C8WB2M,Boxers are durable and feel nice on my skin.,5

B087C8WB2M,"Purchased for my husband he loves them! Very soft, comfortable and well made.",5
B087C8WB2M,comfortably,5
B087C8WB2M,These CK micro-fiber boxers are extremely comfort and have great fit. Use the sizing advice that comes with the order form and they will fit perfectly.,5
B087C8WB2M,Great fit plus a great look,5
B087C8WB2M,I chose the normal size in all the calvin kleins i own and these were noticeably smaller. Obviously can't return them so just took the L on that.,3
B087C8WB2M,Gravdson likes them,5
B087C8WB2M,"Pretty good underwear, no complaints other then there is no slot for your gentleman sausage. Really don't know why companies continue to make underwear like that. Maybe it was my fault for not doing the proper research but really makes no sense to not have the slot for going #1.",3
B087C8WB2M,"6'2 thick dude here, usually 36-38"" waist. LOVE the fit of these in XL on me. I highly recommend trying them!",5
B07TVCJG3J,"I have a foot injury that has caused my right foot to be permanently swollen, so I have to wear thin socks to fit in my shoes. However, I can still walk fine, and do so every day--two miles at a very fast pace, and I wear these on every walk. I'm 6'4"" and 230 lbs, so I put a lot of stress on my footware. And because of the injury I can't pull my laces tight, so the heel of my shoe slides up and down a little bit with every step (which often wears the heel of a sock out quickly). With all this stress, these socks have lasted two and a half years so far without wearing out much at all. One of them (out of 16 pairs) is developing a thin spot over the big toe and another one has a small hole on the top of the foot--probably snagged on something. All in all, these are fantastic socks.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Soft, good quality. A bit to the long side for the size (aka big in size and long crew)",5
B07TVCJG3J,"These are good for fit, comfort, material, and they launder well. I especially like that the toes don't have clusters of threads. (I switched from Gold Toe because they have always had uncomfortable lumps of thread hanging around the toes. That and they seem to be overpriced lately.) The only issue is that quite a few have developed splits in the seams at the ankles. Looks like they shape them like a foot with a seam from ankle to ankle around the heal. The seam is good: smooth and well done. But at the point where it ends at the ankle, holes develop. The holes appear sometimes after only a few wearings. They need to reinforce that point. That said, I like them so much I plan to buy another package when the ones I have wear out. I'm hoping they correct the one weakness by then. I'll put up with losing 2 or 3 out of each dozen if the rest hold up because I do like the price and comfortable fit. They really are nice, other than for the holes. I took off 1 start for that. Otherwise would be 5 stars.",4
B07TVCJG3J,"The socks fit snuggle, not too tight. The socks stay up on your leg and are very comfortable.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"These socks are very comfortable, nice weight. Great feel on my feet not too heavy and hot.Perfect weight and feels much more expensive than the cost.They arrived in a box all put together, nice presentation .So happy a choose this brand!!",5
B07TVCJG3J,good fit and quality,5
B07TVCJG3J,"My son's feet smell awful when he wears synthetic socks. These seem to solve that problem, thank goodness. However they do run small so know that going in. They're great quality and have stood up after being put through the paces with my 8 y.o. and have held up after several washings. Would definitely buy again.",5
B07TVCJG3J,These are the only socks I have been able to find that don't gradually squeeze a very uncomfortable groove around the calf of my leg.,5
B07TVCJG3J,Promised product was delivered promptly,5
B07TVCJG3J,This is a very nice feeling sock and so far it has not disappointed me.,4
B07TVCJG3J,Right out of the package I was impressed. The overall quality of the socks is noticeable. Great price also!,4
B07TVCJG3J,"I have not had a chance to wear them long enough to comment on the ""durability"" of these socks but what I can comment on is the size.I wear a size 12M so ordered the stated 9-12 size. They arrived in a box marked ""medium"". I have to say they fit perfectly. I like the colors as well. Recommend? Yes.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Love the white socks.  My feet are usually very slightly damp when taking my shoes off at night, but much less as compared to other socks.  The socks do get pilly fairly soon, but not noticeable when wearing. Good fit, not too small.  Nicely packaged.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Received my order and I am very pleased with the order. Socks feel comfortable and I am happy with them. I highly recommend them.,5
B07TVCJG3J,Liked the fit and the texture which is similar to support hose.,5
B07TVCJG3J,These are nice looking socks and wash well.,5
B07TVCJG3J,Used smoothly,5
B07TVCJG3J,"Comfortable, durable, and a great price.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"SPECTACULAR, INCREDIBLE QUALITY... AND A MAGNIFICENT PRESENTATION... 100% RECOMMENDED. 10/10!",5
B07TVCJG3J,Nice socks,5
B07TVCJG3J,It's hard to find colors that come close to my many pants but this company offers a great range and a high-quality sock.  Stitching in the heel and toe is nice and you can't feel it in your shoes.  The fabric is so soft yet holds well against my feet and ankles.  Diffentiley going to try the other colors offered.,5
B07TVCJG3J,"These dress socks have a good fit,very comfortable and a nice price.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Nice a dn easy to slip on, comfortable to wear.",5
B07TVCJG3J,I wanted a thin pair of mostly-cotton socks and these work great.  My thicker pair of ~100% socks have become somewhat coarse after many washings so I wear the Wander socks underneath act as a barrier.,5
B07TVCJG3J,Happy  with the product,5
B07TVCJG3J,"I wanted a set of thin socks to wear underneath heavier socks--in Winter--to keep my feet warm.  I tried finding ""undersocks"" and/or ""liners"" but couldn't find what I wanted, so I went to ""thin"" dress socks which worked out well.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"I gave the socks away for the size was way to small for me, My Shoe Size is 11.  I bought size 13-15 and that was to small. I gave the socks 3 stars for the quality looks good and it feels soft.I would not buy again.",3
B07TVCJG3J,"I finally found them!  Several years ago I bought a set of Dockers brand socks in Large 13-15 which were perfect - they lasted a long time, were comfortable, and stayed up.  They had the Docker's logo stitched into the arch.  But after many years of daily wear, they have simply worn out.  For a year, I've been searching for these socks and finally decided to try these Wander brand socks.  They appear to have been made in the exact same factory!  I can put the two socks side-by-side and every stitch is in the same place.  These socks feel the same and work just as well.They stay up, they are durable, and they feel comfortable for standing 8 hours or more a day.  The only difference is that these have the Wander logo stitched into the toe.  I have just ordered another box of eight in case they disappear from the market again.Don't expect thick socks.  These are thin dress socks.  They look great after hundreds of washings.  Highly recommend!",5
B07TVCJG3J,My husband really loves these socks. They look nice and are very comfortable.,5
B07TVCJG3J,This product is excellent I enjoy wearing them!,5
B07TVCJG3J,The comfort is amazing,5
B07TVCJG3J,Great size and fit.,5
B07TVCJG3J,My husband wanted a lightweight sock. These are great! Packaged beautifully too.,5
B07TVCJG3J,"These are great socks, comfortable, and they actually fit my feet. Nice packaging too. I will definitely buy again when I need them.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Elastic seems cheap, it starts crackling when you put them on, like old elastic. They are comfortable, thin, and light as advertised, but for some reason at the end of the day the top has rolled down into a ring that may cut circulation.",3
B07TVCJG3J,"Quality across the board in price, packaging, delivery, and fitment.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Product, service, delivery excellent.  Tx!",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Well, Made and not pokey with a right amount of softness and style",5
B07TVCJG3J,"I did not expect these stockings to be on par with much costlier ones, however they are just so very well made and costlier looking. They are sized correctly.  The designs are rich looking, the material is strong yet soft, the toes are reinforced, the length is generous and not short,  and they wash well without any shrinkage or fading. I ordered a second set as they are priced great.  They arrived fast through Prime.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Exactly as advertised,5
B07TVCJG3J,Best socks that I've ever purchased. Extremely comfortable and durable.,5
B07TVCJG3J,My husband is a farmer and wears work boots each and every day.  These socks are perfect for him...just the right weight for the hot weather...fabric is of very high quality and doesn't make his feet sweaty and uncomfortable; yet they are heaven enough to protect his feet from rubbing in his boots.  He's very pleased with them!!,5
B07TVCJG3J,"Let me join the chorus of reviewers that are raving about these socks. They are awesome. They fit beautifully. They feel amazingly smooth inside. They stay put and do not fall down. My only regret is that you are going to buy them, drive up demand - and I will have to pay more when I order again.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Perfect thinnest he needed to wear for his shoes. There is no slipping or shrinkage when washed. Price for eight pairs was fantastic. Quality was great. Truly appreciated the appearance when they all neatly arrived in a box!,5
B07TVCJG3J,You wont be sorry with these socks,5
B07TVCJG3J,Perfect for my 94 year old Father!,5
B07TVCJG3J,"He is 6'2"", 225, chicken legs. Shoe/boot size 12.5 -13 EE - EEE, depending upon brand. He loves thin, absorbent socks to wear with his barn boots.As stated in other reviews these are not super thin like a dress sock, but they are thin.I ordered the larger size to accommodate his wide feet. These gave him ample stretch around the ball of his foot. I would call them a longer crew sock. Measurement from about his ankle bone to top of sock was a solid 6""+. He says the socks stay up on his leg without being too tight.I ordered the navy combo to match blue jeans. 6 pairs, three designs. There were two pairs of each design, which is perfect for the inevitable holes that will appear in one sock. Two pairs were solid blue.I hope these socks are still available in a year when it's time to buy more!",5
B07TVCJG3J,Excellent product and service!,5
B07TVCJG3J,I love the way the stitching at the toe can't be felt.  The brand of socks I had worn for years the stitching was very noticeable and a bother.  I like having 8 pair of socks that are all the same.  Previously buying socks 3 pair at a time it was always and effort to match up socks.  I'm 70 years old and hands down these are the most comfortable socks I have ever owned!,5
B07TVCJG3J,Quality product,5
B07TVCJG3J,"I love these socks. I keep buying them over and over. They're comfortable, I don't sweat in them and they're exactly what I need.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Been wearing these socks for over 3 years. The socks are of very high quality. I ordered them for the second time. I advise everyone.,5
B07TVCJG3J,"My husband wanted me to order him some black cotton socks that were not thick and heavy and went no higher than the calf. I found these WANDER Men's Dress Socks Cotton Thin Classic Lightweight Socks that were 85% cotton, so I purchased them. Plus, they were available in the 13-15 size, which is what my husband needed. Unfortunately, after just the second washing, one of the socks got a hole right above the ankle and the sock was thrown away. As it was only the second washing, I suppose it's likely that this will not be the only sock to get a hole after such limited use. But even so, he is down one pair of socks because the remaining sock does not have a mate. This one sock that got a hole could have been an isolated incidence, but I gave this product only 2 stars because of the issue after only 2 times worn. Otherwise,  my husband was happy with the fit and comfort of these WANDER men's socks.",2
B07TVCJG3J,"So far I am very pleased with these socks. I wore gold toe crew socks for years, but they changed the material so that it is thicker and harder to get on for an old man like me. Searched around and found these. Have not washed them yet to see about shrinkage etc.. They are soft and have elastic that is not too tight. I wear size 13 shoe and find large is good for my feet.",5
B07TVCJG3J,good wear and does well after multiple washings,5
B07TVCJG3J,"Great fit, quality and comfort. I got size large as I am a size 11.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"These socks are great! They fit my size 10.5 feet perfectly.  Not too tight, not too loose. The material is awesome too, very comfy",5
B07TVCJG3J,"Being in a suit and shoes is not comfortable thing for me especially if I have to be dressed up for up to 12 hrs. That's why finding suits dress socks is not an easy task for me. Most of men dress socks got high level of polyester in them which makes my feet hot, create uncomfort and they are less absorbent. I prefer cotton dress socks but many of them look good but thick to be for shoes. That was the best I have ever purchased in years. I have been using them for a week now and I can tell you that I'm glad I stumbled over this brand. They cotton, comfortable, not thick at all and the design can go with any kind of suit, ties or shoes. I highly recommend them.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Very good quality socks and feel soft and comfortable,5
B07TVCJG3J,excelente materiales. Me gusta mucho. muy confortables,5
B07TVCJG3J,Its material is soft and good and has a suitable box for gifting.,5
B07TVCJG3J,Just the right weight,5
B07TVCJG3J,comfy,4
B07TVCJG3J,"Looks good, feels good, esdy to put on.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"I bought these for travel socks, something I could wear frequently and wash out in the hotel room.  These are perfect!",4
B07TVCJG3J,I needed a light white sock. Stores do not have this item.  it arrived and was exactly what I wanted. Comfortable when Im wearing by boots.,5
B07TVCJG3J,Socks are comfortable,4
B07TVCJG3J,They give you plenty off socks. Great deal.,5
B07TVCJG3J,I would recommend these socks.  Good price point.  They are good dress socks.  Not great.  But good.,4
B07TVCJG3J,Great feel,5
B07TVCJG3J,First time purchase.  Love these socks.  Time will tell how long then last.  Comfy and fit well.  Recommend.,5
B07TVCJG3J,"The best dress socks I ever had. Great fabric, cotton blend. Great fit and quality !!!",5
B07TVCJG3J,My husband stayed that he likes the comfort and I only hope your company increases the colors and designs and not just browns and blacks,5
B07TVCJG3J,"Pliable and well made.  So far, long lasting.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Great quality. Perfect length and the material is amazing. Not too thick or thin. Love these,5
B07TVCJG3J,Stayed up and were comfortable. Hoping they last!,5
B07TVCJG3J,Mi parecer,5
B07TVCJG3J,great socks,5
B07TVCJG3J,"Very comfortable, soft and nice quality. The packaging is beautiful they come all individually wrapped in a nice presentation. They are thick but still breathable with nice support and cushion.",5
B07TVCJG3J,"I got these to ""standardize"" on one work sock. They last, they breathe well, don't hold foot sweat (as long as worn only one day), and the fit doesn't change with washing. All for a very reasonable price. I also got them because they're thin, and with one very and one slightly deformed feet, I needed that to stay in even extra-wide shoes with orthotics for a full day. Just understand that they have almost no cushioning, being about the same thickness as liner socks. I use SmartWools when I know I'll be doing a lot of walking, hiking or sightseeing.",5
B07TVCJG3J,Good fit and very comfortable.,4
B07TVCJG3J,"Comfortable,  sized perfectly for my 10.5 shoe size.Washed without loss of color or significant shrinkage. Perfect! Much, much better quality than Gold Toe socks. And they are 85% Cotton for breathability!",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The shirt is very comfortable to wear in resect to fabric, seams, and sizing. The OD green is a nice tone, suitable for camping or light tactical uses. Fabric is light weight, breathable, and could be comfortably worn under body armor or load bearing vest. The only ""negative"" would be that the short sleeves were about 2"" too long per my personal preferences. My dress shirt long sleeve measurements are 32/33"". I am a size 48-50"" chest, 5'8"", 235 lb and the size 2XL is a great fit. Would buy again.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I really enjoy the shirt I ordered. Its nice and slim fitting, it breaths fantastic when wind picks up. The build quality is also there, feels great in the hand and after a few washes it remains unshrunk. The one problem I have with this shirt is you can really tell its polyester. Not a big deal but after you work in the heat it can start to smell a bit worse than a cotton blend would",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Fits great; excellent value-- functional sleeve -pen pocket and sunglasses'  loop-- excellent colors and wash n wear-- no iron needed,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"This shirt was purchased as a gift, for someone who has trouble finding a proper fitting style due to their size. The color and the material was perfect, the fit was neither tight not loose. The shirt is made of quality material that is not too thick or thin making it a great shirt for causal activities. Very versatile shirt for warm or cold weather.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,The weave of the polyester is rough and thicker than other similar shirts.  It's much warmer in comparison to a similar Under Armour shirt.,3
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Makes for a great work polo. The pockets on the sleeve and the sunglasses loop on the chest are really convenient. The shirt is comfortable and fits true to size. Sleeve length hits your arm at just the right spot. These are my new go to work shirts. They wash really well. I always hang them up to dry, so I don't know if they shrink much in the dryer or not.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"CQR Men's Polo Shirt, Short Sleeve Tactical Shirts, Dry Fit Lightweight Performance Golf Shirts, Outdoor UPF 50+ Pique ShirtI'm impressed.I spent about 25ish on each of these shirts (I bought more than one and they had different prices).  I was going to buy the cheap  10-12 dollar polo's, but my biggest beef with buying cheap polo's is that they shrink and/or the collar curls.  First think I did was wash and throw them in the drier.  These shirts are fully synthetic so they held their shape, and weren't wrinkled.The shirts feel comfortable and the weave is different for the various shirts, some seem to be more breathable than others.Fit- Medium seems a bit large - maybe small would be better (bought for medium sized frame)- X-Lrg is about right, maybe just a tiny bit larger (bought for Large to X-lrg sized frame)How long will these shirts last without snagging or developing lint balls?  I don't know, just got them, but the fabric seems to be better quality than other similar type shirts.The label says made in Vietnam.I recommend these polo shirts.  I paid for them and received no compensation for this review.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Nice and comfortable shirt, a comforting place to hang a pen and glasses. The color is a bit faded.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I took a chance on this. I normally just plain colors, but this really caught my eye. Every time I wear it I always get compliments. It's a lighter material than I normally wear, but very comfortable!",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Buen producto, talla correcta",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Love this shirt for its fit and material.. well made!,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Es una camisa de Excelente calidad. A mi gusto es medio calurosa y pesada pero todo lo demas es excelente,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I have purchased several of these in various colors and all have been true to size. Will definitely purchase this brand again,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,An absolute great buy. Will recommend anyone to purchase. Very nice! Love it! Fast shipping,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I bought these shirts for work and had a logo stitched in. Have worn for several months and they are holding up well. Very comfortable.Did get a snag in one shirt so 4 stars instead of 5. But no additional ones so far. Fingers crossed?,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Es un excelente producto, la tela fresca y muy adecuada para el clima tropical, la talla fue perfecta",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,freat,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The sizing is perfect with these, so if you're an American large, order a large. These would run big on Europeans. My first impression is that I love everything about this shirt from the size to the fit to the feel of it. I sent it to the company that does all of our embroidery and had our logos put on it. I ordered matching hats from our embroidery company (Darter Specialties in CT - they ship all over the country - we're in Ohio), and they're a perfect match.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Just what I want and needed,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Good quality, comfortable shirt.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great Shirt.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"This is a perfect shirt, the quality, the fit and the design. I purchased 2. A fellow coworker purchased them and we had our logo put on them. You get a professional look, quality fit for this.  Love the wide range of colors, definitely this drab green.If I could change one aspect would be to make the sleeves maybe 1 in longer, this is more of a preference. I'm 6'3"" with longer arms. Still 5 stars.The pen holders on the arm and at the center of chest are great added features for my line of work.  I look forward to purchasing more.More importantly this shirt gets the women. If I only had this shirt sooner I might still have a wife. She left me and I believe it's because I didn't have this shirt.She is sad now and wants me back but the shirt found me a woman who treats me right. Unfortunately I have to leave the shirt on.  Yes it's that good. The shirt not the Ex.  If anyone in interested in being treated wrong don't purchase this shirt or meet my ex. You will regret both decisions.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"It is important to not up front that i LOVE these shirts.  They fit well, they're comfortable, the colors are good, the pen pockets have been life changing.  I would wear these shirts every did IF I could. Unfortunately, I can't.  I work in a light duty warehouse environment (think cardboard and plastic, not wood and steel) and in less than 6 months all of these shirts are getting pulls and snags from contact with cardboard and other common surfaces.These shirts are too expensive to consider disposable and replace every year.  They would probably be okay for an office or mail room, but not for much heavier use. I am a fan of CQR products and wear the pants to work with no issue.  I will continue to wear these shirts in my leisure time, but have begun investigating more durable options for use at work.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Love the sunglasses loop and the fit and colors are great.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I love CQR my closet is full of their gear! Ty guys!!!,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Not too shiny and fits well.  Not as well as the model in the pictures, but he's built better.  I like the pockets and the loops for your glasses.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Shirt started to fray after I washed it once. Love the shirt and comfortability but seems cheaply made.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"These are excellent shirts for the money.  I have purchased other ""tactical"" polos that cost twice as much and were not as comfortable.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I love the size and colors of these shirts.  However I had to remove a star because the material is a tight knit that has already started pilling and I have multiple areas where little snags have popped out.  I've only worn this shirt 5 or 6 times so I'm not even sure if I'll even get to wear it 20 times before I have to retire it.  Everything else, temperature, value, style, fit, and breathability are great.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Great shipper, great seller",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,These are some of the best shirts I have bought. Super lightweight fit really well. I love that they have a lage in a Tall size and the same with extra large. sleeves and shoulder seams sit at the perfect spot much cooler than other dry fit type shirts. The only issue is with Amazons delivery. I have put specific instructions that have yet to be followed. Dogs got packages and destroyed several times. There needs to be more color options in the xl tall size. I just however cannot say enough good things about these shirts,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Like the color. Fits good. Just hesitant if it will get holes easy since it is a little to thin for what I thought but it is comfortable and would get more will see after a few washes,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,True to size. Comfortable in fall spring weather but may nit be breathable during the humid summer days.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Bought the shirt, but fit was too small.  Had to return.  Make sure to check your actual size and refer to their chart for correct sizing before ordering.  Material was nice, can not say more as I did keep it.",3
B0CL6FGZ9H,i bought it for a present it's very nice,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,This shirt is great if you are looking for a light/form fitting shirt that is light weight and breathable! Quality isn't the greatest but you get what you pay for.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Nothing special, fits nicely and is decent fabric. Also has a stiff collar and as we all know that is all that matters in a polo.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The shirt is soft, breathable, and has an athletic cut to it so its not excessively baggy in the waist. The material is similiar to some exercise shirts, but it doesn't really look like it unless you are very close.  The collars seem solid and hopefully won't curl without needing stays in them.The material could definitely snag, but that is the downside to the breathable material.Also the sizing is way off.  I wear a Mens M in just about everything from stores and a S in this shirt is a solid men's M.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Decent quality shirt but beware it runs smaller than normal so definitely order a size up from what your used to.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"The package arrived promptly, and I am satisfied with the quality of the shirt. I particularly like the extra loops for my sunglasses and a pen.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,I needed this shirt for a business outing. I had it embedded with the company logo.  Perfect fit and a great value for the money.  I have since bout 2 more.  Love it,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I'm really impressed with this polo shirt. It feels very sturdy and well-made, like it's built to last for years. The fabric is thick and durable, yet it's also comfortable to wear. I appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction; everything seems solid and well put together. The design is classic and versatile, making it suitable for both casual outings and more formal occasions. It's easy to care for too; I've washed it a few times already and it still looks as good as new. The fit is true to size, which is always a plus when ordering online. Overall, I'm pleased with the quality and durability of this polo shirt. It's a great addition to my wardrobe and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting piece.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I have worn the shirts I purchased and they are excellent quality. Lightweight yet durable. Colors hold up after repeat washings. Great value for the money. Good for work in the field or the office and also can be worn for casual gatherings. 5 stars well earned and will buy from seller again.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I haven't worn this type of shirt in half a century,  and fortunately when I ordered this one it has turned out to be a winner. I have  thoroughly enjoyed this shirt this summer season. The size and color are perfect,  it washed well and comes from the dryer ready to wear.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Good quality and color. Runs large so had to return the 2x for an XL for my husband. Once we got the right size, it was a good fit.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I think these shirts are great like the colors and very comfortable I'm getting more great company,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Seems to be nice material, fits nice, and launders well.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Soft and fits nicely.,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,I like these shirts. I was skeptical at first but they are a good quality shirt. I liked it so much I bought a 2nd one.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,This is a moderately heavy shirt that looks good. I'm going to wash mine with Woolite or Oxo-clean for light colors and dry in delicate so it lasts. These are could if you want to wear something a little more formal than a T-shirt. I like them.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,My wife is very impressed. What better feedback do I need?,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Comfortable and durable,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Fits well and excellent workmanship.  Material is worth the time to order.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Purchased this in the middle of a hot streak... what a awesome shirt.  It fits great and it truly does keep you cool and dry.  It is my favorite golf shirt!!!,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Nice shirts.  I got 5 of them.  Good fit.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,My husband does not like to wear cotton shirts for many reasons.  I found these  and they look great on!  The fit is really nice (even on a little dad-bod belly) and they wash and dry without wrinkling.  Whew!  No maintenance.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Nice shirt but thin and tight and runs small so you better look somewhat like the model. I wanted a polo more like a shirt not T-shirt. I am sending back.,3
B0CL6FGZ9H,"They fit well.They look good.And I'm a bigger guy (XXL).I look a little slimmer in them.For the price, I bought 5 of them for work (I need collared shirts for work).They're all different colors, so no-one accuses me of not doing laundry.They're light-weight and breathable, so they are comfortable for the summertime.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I bought this shirt for tactical use but also use it in a casual office environment. Looks good and functions well.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great shirt for the price.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Good quality but size didn't match,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Please please restock in 2x Tall,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Good shirt, pretty basic and not my favorite. I love the brand, but I could take or leave this shirt.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great quality and breathable material !,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Seems to be decent quality but definitely a cherry red vs brick or darker red pictured,4
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Between myself and my son, we own like 5 of these shirts. Lightweight dry-fit type material, but in a thicker weave, so perfect for the office. So far they are also washing up very nicely and haven't snagged or pilled yet.Will definitely get more when more colors are available. XL-tall fit perfectly.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I have ordered many different brands and the essential and basic in this brand and keep going back to this pro polo. Please get more pro polos in sizes other than small.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"I'm 6'2,210lbs ,athletic build and the large tall fits perfect. I always have a problem finding shirts.  Large fits well but is usually too short.  XL is  long enough but too big and boxy.  I'm glad I came across this brand and the tall sizes.  I bought 5 of these for work to replace a different brand that has lasted a couple years now.  The material on these shirts is a little thinner but feels much better and they stretch which is nice for comfort.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Was looking for a work shirt and this has some comfortable cloth. Totally stoked i got it during sale! Its totally worth it though as it is as dry fit as they state it is. Love the color and the cuts on the side.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Fit good, nice true color",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Just received it today, but I like how it looks on me and so far it seems like a great Polo shirt.  Now just have to keep an eye on durability.",4
B0CL6FGZ9H,The color and fit are great! Has not shrunk and is holding up well. Keeps my viking size hubby dry while looking professional for work. Going to order more in other colors.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Yeah, I know, hard to believe.  I have PRPS jeans, prada shoes and collector Nike's.  I've been an unwitting expensive clothing hoarder forever.  I have tried everything they offer.  The camo flanel / fleece shirts are my favorite.  These crews are perfectly balanced between sheen, weight and shape.  The drape perfectly (5'10"", 190, size L).And the sizes are true to shape.  I got some polo shirts, both long and short sleeve, with and without the little pen pockets and other thoughtful little places to put things and I find myself wearing them more than anything else.  Great brands, I bet any of the products  you try by them you'll like.  Olive green and charcoal are amazing colors in any style shirt they have!",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I ordered this shirt for my husband for a family reunion. It was a great fit and the color was great on him. I will be ordering another in a different color.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,I like the shirt a lot it fits nice based on your recommendation to pick out a large. I would definitely buy again and I want to thank you for having it available.,5
B0CL6FGZ9H,"Bought this shirt to have embroidered for my admin shirt. I wear the cqr tactical shirt most days for work and it fits amazing but this polo is definitely not made with the same sizing guidelines. Fits in width but seems to be short.Shirt is very lightweight, soft material, wish it was true to size.",2
B0CL6FGZ9H,"This was perfect. Sizing was great and material is very breathable. Great for law enforcement/security staff, as well as your every day civilian.",5
B0CL6FGZ9H,Great,5
B082BF9MPC,"Comfortable, warm, and sturdy.",5
B082BF9MPC,"I got these for my boyfriend and he loves them. He wears boots to work and complained about the other sock brand he was wearing before. These are soft, cushiony, good quality, he wears a size 13-14 in shoes and they fit good. I recommend them",5
B082BF9MPC,My son works outside in the winter for long periods of time. I bought these to keep his feet warm. He'd been buying feet warmers to help before I bought him the socks. He has not needed feet warmers since. I highly recommend if you are outside in the cold!,5
B082BF9MPC,"Good quality, very comfortable and very warm",5
B082BF9MPC,Not enough thick. A suture incide is very uncomfortable.,3
B082BF9MPC,"These socks will not lasts you forever. But for the price compared to the number of socks it is a good deal in my eyes. I wear out socks easily doing construction work and working out and these have held up well. They fit well as they stretch and function as you would hope they would. They extend a bit up the calf so if that bothers you when you wear shorts, look elsewhere.",5
B082BF9MPC,Nice warm socks with good elastic. Appear to be made well and are very comfortable.,5
B082BF9MPC,These get tough use & hold up fairly well. Next set I'll look for a little more density,4
B082BF9MPC,Very comfortable,4
B082BF9MPC,The socks provide much needed comfort to my feet.,5
B082BF9MPC,Wish they were a little thicker,5
B082BF9MPC,"They keep  his feet dry and comfortable.  They don't shrink  after washing,  very good warmth.",4
B082BF9MPC,Very please with these !! Very soft and comfortable!! Would but again !!,5
B082BF9MPC,Socks fit good,5
B082BF9MPC,great choice!,5
B082BF9MPC,"Perfect! Thick, warm , but moisture wicking. No sweaty toes.  Wash inside out!",5
B082BF9MPC,"Husband loves them, says they're just what he wanted",5
B082BF9MPC,This is a good bargain in my opinion! They are good quality socks too!  The ankles stay tight after multiple washes & wears.,5
B082BF9MPC,"Great socks, great price,Good quality. Would recommend!",5
B082BF9MPC,"My son absolutely loves these for his outdoor job. They keep his feet dry and warm, even on the coldest and wettest days.",5
B082BF9MPC,"Bought these for my husband and he told me he never wants different socks, that I always have to buy them. He said they are the most comfortable socks he's ever had. I kept one pair and I think the same. Wish I could give ten stars! Great product!",5
B082BF9MPC,no issues with product works great,5
B082BF9MPC,"These while they are nice socks, are not work boot socks, these are thin and not something you would wear in boots to work in.",3
B082BF9MPC,"Having only worn one pair since I received them, they seem to fit well, are comfortable, and seem to hold up well from the constant walking and moving around in the warehouse. I will see exactly how well after wearing these socks more.",4
B082BF9MPC,LIked very much!,5
B082BF9MPC,My husband is always reluctant to buy stuff he needs and he'd sigh that his socks made him sad so I took it upon myself to buy him socks. He was thrilled with these and asked me to get him a second package.  He now comments that he doesn't have to make a decision about which socks are less wrong because he tossed out all his old socks and can just grab a pair of these.,5
B082BF9MPC,I wanted socks that were made in the USA... these are MADE IN CHINA!,3
B082BF9MPC,Good comfortable socks just get holes very fast,3
B082BF9MPC,I like the socks for a giftI don't like that when  I took  them out of the box they were not sealed  closed,3
B082BF9MPC,My husband loves these socks.,5
B082BF9MPC,I bought these for my hubby. As he put them on this morning he said they are very soft and comfortable,5
B082BF9MPC,I love it and worthy to have it smile will buying again winks,5
B082BF9MPC,"perfect thickness  soft, makes my foots feel great  quick shipping",5
B082BF9MPC,Feet got cold,3
B082BF9MPC,"These socks are heavy duty, soft and wash well.  They are sized accurately and comfortable.",5
B082BF9MPC,My husband says these are the best socks he has ever had,5
B082BF9MPC,Socks were exactly what my son wantedArrived on time & a good value,5
B082BF9MPC,"Got these on Monday and have been putting them to the test all week. For reference, I work in a lumber yard.Excellent socks overall. Feet aren't cold when I'm outside, feet aren't hot when I'm inside. Boots certainly contribute to that comfort, but it's a team effort. Haven't experienced any chafing or excessive wear, form factor doesn't appear to change significantly after washing (cold water) and drying (medium heat), and the second use of any given pair feels more or less the same as the first. These socks have also managed a feat that none of my other socks have achieved: defying gravity itself, they don't creep down my legs and into my boots over the course of the work day. For me, that alone makes them worthy of a five star rating.My only wish, cherry on top, is that they were slightly longer; an inch or two would be plenty. Most of the other socks I've used for working in boots are longer than these and I've found that I do miss that extra smidge of coverage, if only because I'm used to it. That being said, the shorter length of these socks may be the secret to their antigravity powers. If that's the case, stay golden.",5
B082BF9MPC,These are not the most comfortable socks i have ever wore they make my feet hurt but i do have neuropathy so its hard for me to find socks that don't hurt my feet i did get some from Costco that i really like but there is not one near me other then that they where a good buy,3
B082BF9MPC,NICE PRODUCT GREAT VALUE,5
B082BF9MPC,Thick comfy and light. Perfect under work boots.,4
B082BF9MPC,Keeps feet relatively cool while providing comfort in muck boots and work boots. Wish they were a bit more snug,4
B082BF9MPC,They seemed tight when I first bought them but after one wash they are very comfortable.,5
B082BF9MPC,Good buy,5
B082BF9MPC,Excellent,5
B082BF9MPC,mi espso me a dicho que los a sentido muy comodos,4
B082BF9MPC,They are excellent!,5
B082BF9MPC,"They are very resistant and durable, high quality materials and feel comfortable, they dont feel like the cheap kind and overall they work fine for me with military boots.",5
B082BF9MPC,Product not as thick as advertised,3
B082BF9MPC,"I'm glad I tried these. Other brands in this price range were very tight on the calves, not these. These fit nicely and don't slide down while wearing work boots. They can be folded down for tennis shoes as well. Recommended !",5
B082BF9MPC,Very comfortable,5
B082BF9MPC,as ordered,5
B082BF9MPC,Great,5
B082BF9MPC,So far so good,3
B082BF9MPC,Love them,5
B082BF9MPC,"Alright sock just needs to improve the top of the sock when it comes to going on your feet and the top of sock on your calves. Tight going on and tight at the top needs to be more expandable. Smaller feet probably okay, I am a 12 and a half, somewhat of a hassle putting them on.",3
B082BF9MPC,They were for my hubby..he said they were ok,3
B082BF9MPC,"I lie them, just tight around the calf , but other than that very nice",4
B082BF9MPC,nice,5
B082BF9MPC,"Bought these for my guy to wear to work. He works out in the elements and wear steel toed boots all day, every day. He said these socks work like a champ so far. They do not slip inside his boot like most socks do. Initially, I thought they'd be too thin but, He says they're perfect and that they don't make his feet feel squeezed inside the boot from being too thick. Feet stay dry. Idk how long they'll hold up, but so far they're worth the money especially considering how many pair you get. Shipping was fast.",5
B082BF9MPC,A fine summer weight sock for normal activity.  Not suited for work or heavy use.,3
B082BF9MPC,My son likes them they have just the right amount of cushion and thickness. He likes them.,4
B082BF9MPC,"The socks that I purchased, the bag was ripped open and left on on the ground. I was kinda not unhappy.",2
B082BF9MPC,thanks,5
B082BF9MPC,"nice cushioning in work boot , feet stay cool .worth it",5
B082BF9MPC,Socks are substantial and are perfect for yard work.,5
B082BF9MPC,I got these for my husband because he is on his feet all day.  He says they are comfortable and help to keep his feet cooler.,5
B082BF9MPC,Great fit and very comfortable. I love them. Perfect for the work place enviroment.,5
B082BF9MPC,I ordered a pack with black and white socks the first time which were great. But all black pack seems you made a little different. Labels look the same not sure if it's material or there's something I missed on the label. The pack that comes with black and white seem to be a little more stretchy. Where the all black feels more like knit socks,5
B082BF9MPC,"Not sure about the material, feels like plastic when wearing it for more than 4 hours (Not an active environment). Maybe because I didn't wash them yet? (Usually, wash anything before wearing except socks) . Will update later on, but if you hate that ""wet"" feeling in your feet, don't go for it. Had active jobs before and never had this issue with thick socks, but these aren't the deal. Again, will update if it changes.",2
B082BF9MPC,Comfortable and fit nicely,5
B082BF9MPC,Nice warm work socks.  Comfortable and keeps feet dry and warm.  My men love these.,5
B082BF9MPC,"They feel soft, comfortable, true to size and my boyfriend love them.",5
B082BF9MPC,super,5
B082BF9MPC,"2nd pair, right out the package. In the picture.1st pair were fine, just really tight on the upper leg where the sock ends. I lowered my sock, and saw a band around my leg. Where these socks are too tight..Heal area very thin. First pair after washing is already showing a hole starting to form.",4
B082BF9MPC,The socks are very comfortable,5
B082BF9MPC,Great material and provides awesome comfort,5
B082BF9MPC,Mens work socks,5
B082BF9MPC,This is a great 10 pack of socks to wear.  Please throw out your socks with holes in them!  Great value for the price and hold up very well.,5
B082BF9MPC,I got exactly what I paid for. Very pleased.,5
B082BF9MPC,tough,5
B082BF9MPC,Comfort,4
B082BF9MPC,These socks are sold as work socks but are not what I would call work socks weight. They are quite thin and don't have that much padding on the bottom. I would not buy again. Plus when you wash them they get hard pillings all over them.,3
B082BF9MPC,Got my son these to wear with this work boots. He said they keep is feet warm and come up enough so his ankles are not directly against the inside of his boot.,5
B082BF9MPC,"Got those for my son , right size . His size hard find . Those great socks wearing work in with your oilfield boots . He said : really comfortable. I will buy more in future.",4
B082BF9MPC,"Was a great purchase for me since my budget is tight and I needed new socks, but the quality isn't high. If you can afford better quality i'd recommend against them, but if you need several pairs on a low budget then this is a good option.",4
B082BF9MPC,Good socks. I bought them twice.,5
B075M7KPXP,Very awesome quality . So comfy and roomy . My son loves it,5
B075M7KPXP,It is made very well! feel good and looks good! No lining medium weight. Just the right amount of warmth! Good price. No pilling!,5
B075M7KPXP,"This is one of the most comfortable and durable sweatshirts that you can get.It has a huge pocket in the front and looks great.It has a great color and is very warm.The fabric is bright, and holds its color. These are the only sweatshirts that my diesel mechanic in the house uses. They take a beating and still look great they're very versatile. They are made out of a very tough fabric and hold up great after many washings. He has other brands of sweatshirts hanging in his closet but, always wears these instead of those. We will continue to buy this brand throughout his career. I highly recommend this brand for anyone who wants a rugged sweatshirt that will take a beating and still look new. We give this item a 10 out of 10!!",5
B075M7KPXP,Im used to carhartt hoodies fitting big but this one is more true to size still good quality material and warm,4
B075M7KPXP,"This was a gift. The color was true to description and so was the sizing.  This became the "" New favorite""  in the sweatshirt rotation. Fabric is warm and cozy, perfect for working outdoors and in the garage. Washes well.",5
B075M7KPXP,"Genuine carhartt so the quality is as expected. Midweight is nice and thick, warm. Wanted to leave a review specifically for the color moss. The image in the listing is the perfect green, this is not. It's a very deep olive looks almost grey. Just something to be aware of. I was disappointed",5
B075M7KPXP,"By far my favorite hoodie, ever.  I went back and got one for my dad.  I'm 6'4"" and 300lbs, and sized down because I use it for work and didn't want anything hanging off.  I got a XLT and it's amazing.  I want one in every color.",5
B075M7KPXP,Moss color is deeper and darker than thumbnail picture.Excellent color for a bit cheaper than olive.5 stars,5
B075M7KPXP,"As a big dude, I've always had a difficult time finding a hoodie that fits good while also being warm and comfortable. This one checks all the boxes for what I was looking for. Very happy with it and will probably order a second one in a different color.",5
B075M7KPXP,Love it. Fits great I got the xl long for im 6'3,5
B075M7KPXP,The product arrived 3 days earlier which I love,5
B075M7KPXP,This was an Xmas gift for my husband and it has been his favorite. It was very good quality and a great price for a Carhartt. I have already washed it several times and it looks the same,5
B075M7KPXP,It's the perfect weight for me.  Its held up to several washings and still looks new.,5
B075M7KPXP,This sweatshirt was the perfect size! The color was correct as well overall both me and my boyfriend were very pleased to receive this sweatshirt!,5
B075M7KPXP,"(the hight/weight was just a guess)This was great for my workplace secret Santa. One guy always wears neon yellow so I got the sweat shirt and a bunch of other yellow stuff. It nearly glows and people were impressed by the brand and fit. My coworker is tall and built like a lumberjack. I went off his company jacket size that is a bit too tight and short on him, and using that this was a perfect fit and looked great!",5
B075M7KPXP,"Have yet to wear it yet , but well made like most of your carhart products!",5
B075M7KPXP,Was made exactly as expected for a Carhart. Its not a super thick hoodie but just the right thickness for layering when cold. Didn't have a factory smell or anything like that when it arrived. Would recommend!,5
B075M7KPXP,Great quality material with nice warm lining,5
B075M7KPXP,"Ordered this hoodie for my son for Christmas, he wears a lot of hoodies in this brand, color was nice and always great quality",5

B075M7KPXP,Perfect for winter true to size good material,5
B075M7KPXP,Super soft and lightweight. Love the green color too I got. I ordered XXL I like it over sized look. I'll definitely order again.,5
B075M7KPXP,You can't go wrong with Carhartt. And I loved that they had a tall option. My hubs wore it to work the next day.,5
B075M7KPXP,He loved it!!,5
B075M7KPXP,Well worth the money!!,5
B075M7KPXP,Good fat guy for. Ten times better than Dickies,5
B075M7KPXP,good quality was a little pricey .,5
B075M7KPXP,"Buy one!!! Made great, fits great and worth the price",5
B075M7KPXP,Great fit keep you warm true to size,5
B075M7KPXP,Nice,5
B075M7KPXP,My son likes this carhart hooded sweatshirt. Runs big,5
B075M7KPXP,Just what I ordered,5
B075M7KPXP,Very nice hoodie well made and fits great,5
B075M7KPXP,"Great fit, medium weight.",5
B075M7KPXP,I purchased this Carhartt midweight hooded sweatshirt for my teenage son. This is the perfect hoodie to wear for outdoor activities. It is very durable and strong while keeping him warm. This is his favorite style and comfortable brand of Hoodie. He always asks for a new one each year even though they last a very long time he likes to have a brand new one because he wears his almost every day. This hoodie does not fade after many washes. The threads do not unravel. I highly recommend the Carhartt brand. I will definitely repurchase.,5
B075M7KPXP,"My son in law asked for this last year for Christmas.  He works outside and needed a good thick pull over, I was surprised when it came in of how good the quality is.  He even asked me for another this year, just a different color!",5
B075M7KPXP,"I always go one size bigger with this brand and always fits awesome, loose fit is what I love and they do it right, you get what you pay for and this is a great price for what you get, I own a few and will be buying more thank you I do recommend this sweater as loose fit and lasts forever.",5
B075M7KPXP,I went so quick to order that I got wrong size. Can't return it so now I'm out $50 kinda sucks. Also wish I read it saying loose fit. I went to click medium and checkout right away without double checking medium was in my cart.,3
B075M7KPXP,Looks and fits awesome,5
B075M7KPXP,"I ordered this for my grandson as a gift, he'd been eyeing it for awhile.  He loves the fit, and his wife says he wears it all the time. It's holding up to the use, so quality seems to be pretty good.",5
B075M7KPXP,These hoodie's last a long time so price is very good,5
B075M7KPXP,Fits well,5
B075M7KPXP,"My normal outdoors layered fall/winter wear has a Carhart Hoodie under a Carhart vest.  I have five of these and they do get worn out in time.  Great fit and not bulky for being active cutting firewood, doing oil changes, plowing snow, walking the dog or raking leaves.  I bought a charcoal gray one for ""dress"" wear-LOL.",5
B075M7KPXP,Excellent,5
B075M7KPXP,"Soft,Durable,Good quality good brand washing is easy dosent shrink at all. Order a size down unless you like baggy.",5
B075M7KPXP,Of course it is Carhartt and that is a well recognized brand but this is sturdy fabric and I wear for both work and play. Living an active lifestyle I have not damaged it after wearing nearly a year.,5
B075M7KPXP,"I purchased a size M pullover sweatshirt. I like Carhartt for their quality and have purchased quite a few shirts and sweatshirts in the past. Though I usually wear an M, I will have to return this one for a larger size. Not a loose fit IMO.",5
B075M7KPXP,Fits big so I bought a size smaller and the fit is perfect( normal size is xl and I went with a large). Will buy again,5
B075M7KPXP,Great weight + fit!,5
B075M7KPXP,It is advertised as 100% cotton but in reality it is 59 % cotton and 41 % polyester,4
B075M7KPXP,I don't know about the other reviews but mine pilled up really bad after a couple washes. Before that happened I loved it.,3
B075M7KPXP,"Dad loved it, I'm so glad Amazon had a nice sweatshirt I could get my father for his birthday",5
B075M7KPXP,I bought 2 hoping I'd get to keep 1 but my wife and daughter took them so I'm still cold,5
B075M7KPXP,We loved this! Great quality!,5
B075M7KPXP,My son loves it and wants more!,5
B075M7KPXP,"Thick, tough, definitely loose fit. You can fit a few layers under this if needed",5
B075M7KPXP,A little more baggier which made the fit to big.,3
B075M7KPXP,I'm about 6'6 and my entire life no matter what you ever bought barely came to my waistline and if it did go below a little bit like I liked after a couple washes it would ride up this is the first hoodie I've gotten to not do that I will definitely be buying these as my go-to hoodie from here on out,5
B075M7KPXP,The most comfortable thick sweatshirt I own. Super cute,5
B075M7KPXP,My husband loves this!,5
B075M7KPXP,Great quality work hoodie.,5
B075M7KPXP,"I bought this for my 16 year old son who's 6'6 approx 190 lbs (he prefers super baggy hoodies) so I bought this in a 3x tall and though it swallow him in my opinion,  he literally lives in this thing so the high quality material and construction of this hoodie is a must have. Highly recommend and will definitely buy again",5
B075M7KPXP,Will buy again,5
B075M7KPXP,"Its soft, smaller than advertised, and is really tight around the neck. Very thin and light material. Good solid colors.",3
B075M7KPXP,Nice sweater,5
B075M7KPXP,"True to the brand, the quality is out standing!  Thick, color stable after many repeated washings.  Bought two as gifts for family members who work outside.  They love them!",5
B075M7KPXP,"This is my fifth or sixth Carhartt hoodie, the third purchased from Amazon and this latest one by far feels and looks as though it lacks the quality of my previous purchases. I know Carhartt has pushed it's quality gear to is WIP fashion arm, but decreasing the quality for the people who use the clothing in the spirit of the Carhartt brand may be disappointed by the current quality.",3
B075M7KPXP,Thanks,5
B075M7KPXP,"Got this for a gift for my husband carrhart is his favorite brand for hoodies due to its thickness and warmth since he works in carpentry, he wears it all the time along with another one I got him. A bit oversized but he likes it that way, overall perfect buy!",5
B075M7KPXP,It was a good choice for this fall,5
B075M7KPXP,Runs big. Other than that I love it,4
B075M7KPXP,Always good as expected.,5
B075M7KPXP,"The sweatshirt is good, but it is not 100% cotton as it says on the description.",3
B075M7KPXP,My granddaughters Boyfriend was thrilled to get this sweatshirt and wears it a lot! Perfect shade of green.,5
B075M7KPXP,"I absolutely love this hoodie.  I wear it everyday and almost everywhere.  It's perfect for those days when it's a little chilly out but not too cold to walk the dog.  It's comfortable to wear around the house and something I'll wear to my local, casual restaurant for a burger and fries. It's extremely comfortable and the fit is great.  I've washed it several times following the instructions on the tag and it has come out clean every time without any shrinking or color loss. I'll probably end up buying this same one in other colors just so I have options on laundry day.",5
B075M7KPXP,Carhartt make's good quality stuff love the color and fits great,5
B075M7KPXP,"I love this product it is my favorite hoodie ever for the way it fits, feels and looks. It is a thick material which i appreciate as a fat guy. Thin material is to form fitting and unflattering. This keeps a nice straight body appearance and is warm. I have put the hood up and fallen asleep in it. These sweatshirts are like a warm hug and come in some pretty fantastic colors. If you dont own at least one do yourself a favor and get one. I bought one wore it and determined i needed more, you find something you really like you need to stock up. They sweatshirts sleeves were a great length. i am sure we have all suffered the sweatshirts where the arms are too long and they bunch up near the wrist. These do not do that. They have good solid construction on waste and tuck in to the body. I cant say enough good things about this product.",5
B075M7KPXP,"i love these hoodies.  Carhartt always has the best quality, and perfect fit.  I have to crawl on the ground a lot in rough terrain and these hoodies are very durable.",5
B075M7KPXP,"Was time for another carhartt work hoodie. Not as heavy knit as I hoped, but very nice hoodie.",4
B075M7KPXP,Nice weight and color. Competitively priced,5
B075M7KPXP,Always get the best when you buy carhartt!,5
B075M7KPXP,The description of the product said it was 100% cotton. Not true! Product is only 59% cotton & 41% icky polyester!,3
B075WTPCQ5,"I bought this for an upcoming Disney trip because if you go to Florida, it will rain. It always rains. These rain ponchos are thick, durable and cover everything. They have a waterproof pocket and they come with a pack away bag on a carabiner.",5
B075WTPCQ5,I bought this for a trip to Seattle and it worked perfectly.  Nice and roomy and one size fits most. I don't think you would get hot wearing this bc it is t plastic-y feeling (it was cold when I wore it). Nice color too.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"I knew that it wouldn't be as expected as to what I was buying it for but it is far better than what I thought I would get, with a tweest!!the obvious first: it is essentially as good as everyone else says that they bought it for. I'm a DUUUUDE, so sizing it up was more my end but I think it worked out for exactly what I bought it for, to keep on fishin' when the sky cries. totally perfect for urban/culture-site tourism but not for bushwhacking beyond well manicured trails, the fabric is tent thin and light so I can see it completely ripping in half from snagging on a sharp barb/branch. as for packing it back into the zip-pouch it comes with, it does take a bit of effort to get it back in if you just only fold the poncho in halves but it can be done.other points: color was right on. the racist-against-lefties pocket isn't anchored down though so it is free-swinging, but you probably didn't buy this to reenact a CCR song. a bit too light so it can be whipped up and around from modestly strong winds if it's not zipped up and buttoned down. the snaps are maybe just a bit too good, I can easily see someone absentmindedly pulling it apart too forcefully and ripping the fabric away from them.fit: oddly the backside seem shorter than the description by like maybe by 2 or 3 inches. if you're not careful, you can accidentally zip up into your chin skin pretty easily cause the ""necking/throat"" is more narrowish. the hood isn't wide-spacious either, this can be a bonus if you need to batten down for a torrential downpour or microburst (like the microburst of '95 in upstate NY).quality: haven't had a chance to test it outside yet. zipper is of cheaper tent quality type so it doesn't just flow like a post-rock band hoodie's metallic zipper just does without thought, but it is solid nonetheless and has a rain flap on the inside. the hood has drawstrings with cordlocks but I don't see anyone using them unless their head is literally half the size of mine.my favorite bestest bit: literally, thee most amazing thing ever about this poncho that I've never experienced ever before is the whole winner in all of this being... . . . . THE ZIPPER PULL TABS!!!!  look at them!! so textured!! so fitting!!! this shit ergonomically fits my thumb and index finger so fluidly! my god, the literal FEELS!!!! HOW HAVE I NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE!!!!!about: I'm a 6' 300# dude but not gut-butt heavy, just a solid thick dude up and down and it fits me easily.",4
B075WTPCQ5,"This product is a hit in my family. It has become the choice for going out in the rain. It covers well, folds back and fits in the pouch so nothing else gets wet in your purse or backpack. Definitely a must have !",5
B075WTPCQ5,"I bought the yellow one for myself and loved it so much, I then bought a blue one for a gift.  It's so lightweight, fits comfortably over winter clothing and the colors are great.  Love it!",5
B075WTPCQ5,I am able to fold this rain poncho up. (It has a nice size envelope bag for storing-same color as the poncho !! The poncho is beautiful &easy to carry with you ! Makes you look forward to that next sudden rain !!,5
B075WTPCQ5,Thicker material plenty of space,5
B075WTPCQ5,Does what it should.,4
B075WTPCQ5,"Just received this today and it couldn't arrived on a better day as it has been raining the last couple of days including today.  Very light and thin, but serves it's purpose.  Comes in a pouch that you can throw in your purse or clip to you belt should you be out and about and they are calling for a chance of rain so you are ready and don't need to carry around an umbrella.  I bought it for the main purpose of taking my pups outside to do their business as I cannot just open a door and let them out and call them back inside.  For the money, it is a good product.",4
B075WTPCQ5,"It is packaged well and lovely color (teal).  Has not rained, but, when it does I will be ready!",4
B075WTPCQ5,This is a perfect fit for me and folds up so I can store it in my disaster go-bag,5
B075WTPCQ5,"I haven't used it yet; however, it looks like a winner.",4
B075WTPCQ5,Very nice rain pancho.  The color is really nice & it fits well.,5
B075WTPCQ5,I am guilty of not noticing the details but was really surprised that the one size fits all fit a 2x girl! The zipper addition it awesome! Better than am umbrella anyday!,5
B075WTPCQ5,Fits and looks great.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"Perfect when you have a brace on your arm/shoulder or neck/back. Loose fitting, wide sleeves and zip up front  perfect as a wind breaker and raincoat.",5
B075WTPCQ5,Works perfect and large enough to cover purse and packages.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"This is an impressive looking rain poncho. Besides being pretty (Monet's Water Lilies), comfortable and roomy, there's a convenient full length zipper in front, toggles at the lower front of the hood to snug hood close to face and three snaps on each side (great when its windy), elastic thumb loops at wrist area, and poncho is about knee length in front (on a 5'3"" person) and a few inches longer in back. Did I mention there's one deep pocket on the right front with an overflap and zipper, impressive, right? Also, for keeping dry, this rain poncho is more affordable than buying a rain coat.A design con is the poncho's pouch has a zipper on the long side. Dumb. The pouch is too small for a comfortable, folded and rolled stuff. Then to attempt to zip the overfull pouch is frustrating, really a two people chore. Like sleeping bags, stuff bags never seem big enough for stuffing at home after purchase. With the rain poncho stuffed into the pouch, the thing is bulky (fatter than a closed compact umbrella). But, the pouch has a handy fabric loop and metal lanyard.If this rain poncho had a better designed pouch I'd give it 5 stars, but dinged it due to the ill-fitting pouch.",4
B075WTPCQ5,"Great poncho, have used it now twice for European travels with rainy weather. The only complaint is if you are in extremely windy conditions either belt it or wear a different type of rain gear. The poncho blew like a parachute in high winds. I do have to say I was in crazy windy weather at the Cliffs of Mohr where most of the people wouldn't even go outside and walk the cliffs due to the storm but it managed to keep me mostly dry but a belt would have definitely helped. I have the polka dots and my hubby can always find me.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Got this for hiking. I like the bag it folds up in and it covers me very well when it is raining. It is a bit loud, but that is a small price to pay when you are caught in the woods and it starts pouring. It is never quite as flat in the bag as when it first arrives, but if you vaguely fold it it fits back in just fine.",5
B075WTPCQ5,The rain poncho was large and roomy.  I rated its quality and value as good.,5
B075WTPCQ5,good. quality,5
B075WTPCQ5,"This raincoat is an easy carry, comes with its own case you can hook onto whatever you're carrying - light weight and great coverage",5
B075WTPCQ5,"This is a great product and I will be ordering a different color, but I ordered white and it is actually ivory and labeled as beige. It may not be a big deal for some, just FYI.",4
B075WTPCQ5,Look the color and was just what I was looking for,5
B075WTPCQ5,"I was looking for a rain poncho for fishing.  This poncho was the perfect option.  I ordered a less expensive poncho from this company first and it was great as an emergency rain poncho, but not for wearing regularly.  This one is more expensive, but well worth the extra price.  The plastic is thick, it's warm and it's very well made.  I wish they offered this poncho with a well made hood bill, but as that wasn't an option I am very happy with what I have.  Well worth the purchase!",5
B075WTPCQ5,Good,4
B075WTPCQ5,"This was exactly what I expected in terms of function with perfectly adequate performance for the price. Not very lightweight but you want it to be sturdy enough to not rip, so I'll forgive that. The sleeves were also a tad short when you hold your arms out. But the big deal for me was that the color burgundy I thought I was getting was so far off from the photo as to not count as any screen discrepancy. It was a dull red. Makes me look like a very baggy slightly faded Red Riding Hood. The sophisticated and subtle dark burgundy photo misled me into thinking I would be the one moderately elegant human in a poncho. Nope. But, it does work. If you're thinking this packs down like an emergency poncho, it's more like a very fat clutch purse. Note the weight and dimensions if you're hoping to use for a trip and squeeze into a pack--it takes up a fair amount of space. Still, it's way better to have this than nothing and the color isn't hideous, just weird, and it fits over a backpack and the hood is very substantial with a little helpful brim. My husband ordered the deep sea blue and of course it looks quite fashionable and dapper on him. Oh well. If I get lost on the mountain, they'll know where to find me.",4
B075WTPCQ5,easy to use and wear,5
B075WTPCQ5,"I like the zipper, but my hair, esp my bangs still got soaked.",4
B075WTPCQ5,"I use the raincoat when I ride my scooter. I live in Miami, and it rains many months of the year. This raincoat surprised me because it covers almost your entire body, and I've experienced heavy rains without getting wet. I 100% recommend it.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"This polka-dot poncho is the ultimate fashion statement for anyone who wants to channel their inner Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball, or Minnie Mouse during a downpour. Not only does it keep you dry, but it also adds a touch of playful flair to any rainy-day ensemble. Just be prepared to strike a pose every time you step out, because this poncho will turn heads and make you feel special!I loved the quality. The fabric is very flexible and not at all stiff like plastic poncho's I've had in the past. It did a great job protecting me at the Hops and Crops Music Fest. *Whoo hoo!*",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Good, compact rain gear for the car.",5
B075WTPCQ5,This rain poncho made all the difference in my comfort on those rainy days of my vacation!,5
B075WTPCQ5,Very good,4
B075WTPCQ5,"This rain poncho is really pretty with the painting print on it and nice, watery colors. It also travels well, and folds back up well into its little pouch. It has lots of snaps and closures so you can customize how much coverage you want, and whether you want it to be more like a poncho or more like a raincoat with sleeves. Either way, it's heavy enough to keep the rain and cold off you, and light enough to go anywhere.",5
B075WTPCQ5,Nice quality and good sizing,5
B075WTPCQ5,Ordered for plus size person and it fit perfect and was actually big.  Perfect for sitting at college football game in rain,5
B075WTPCQ5,"Bought two of these in different patters for a trip we are taking to Italy in October.  They are a very nice print/color and nice and long as we are both taller people. Will be easy to pack and will not be wrinkled when pulling from the suitcase.  The only complaint I have is with the design ( which is great and easy on and off).  However, when you snap the arms, the sleeves are pretty short, so if you are going to be wearing a longer sleeve top, you will have to roll it back or you will get clothing wet.  Also part of the forearm will get wet with this design.  Good price - just be prepared with the sleeve design.",4
B075WTPCQ5,This poncho was good. I only wish it was a little longer.,4
B075WTPCQ5,Its great,4
B075WTPCQ5,"I chose the gradient red to match my bright red hiking backpack and to be more visible on the trail. My husband chose the gradient teal. He's the type that would've chosen dark green or black, but I wanted him to be more visible and we wanted to match in the style. It's great that they are cloth, longer than disposable, washable, reusable. We used to get disposable for $1 but they are a lot shorter and wouldn't cover our hiking bags and they always rip the first time we wear them on branches and such. Also, they have snaps so that when you lift your arms, you stay dry because it doesn't blow around or let rain in.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Looks exactly like the picture. Fits great, easy to roll up and store.",4
B075WTPCQ5,"Love the fabric, color, and above all keeps out the weather",4
B075WTPCQ5,"Nice quality rain poncho! Not your cheap ball park models. I use it for unexpected rain while hunting in October. It is very lightweight and comes with its own storage bag, so I just keep it in my hunting backpack.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"I love this rain poncho so much!  I wore it in April to a concert at Red Rocks where it rained the whole time we were there..about 5 or so hours.  The poncho did its job. Was I a little soggy by the end?  Yes, but I would have been soaked...and honestly I was just damp...and that was likely due to me taking my hands out of the jacket I was wearing.  It did its job and it is SOOO cute!  I love that it has a little bag that goes with it, and adds extra protection for items you may not want to get wet, I had my phone in it the whole time.  :)  I have already recommended it to friends.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"This is a great rain jacket. It folds up into a compact package, so it's easy to have inside the backpack, and it is roomy enough that I could wear it over my backpack, too. Really like the zipper feature & ability to cinch the hood around my face. Only thing I wish is that it had a pocket inside as well as outside for when the rain is pouring and I pulled my arms inside. Got lots of compliments on it when I wore it (and wore it and wore it) on a trip to China.  Very durable.",5
B075WTPCQ5,Protection from rain in the tropics.  It worked very well .,5
B075WTPCQ5,"I bought one of these before heading out to a music festival where heavy rain was in the forecast. Ended up making use of it to great effect, withstanding an absolute on-and-off downpour for several hours and dancing without a care in the world. I couldn't be happier I decided to buy this over sticking with some disposable ponchos I also had on hand.The button closures along the sides are great; by default they form sleeves that help keep the poncho in place on your body. The zipper that spans the entire front is quite useful as well; I unzipped the front in between bouts of rain to air myself out as the material - while waterproof - is not breathable by design.It's a good buy.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Great poncho, full coverage,  cute pattern",5
B075WTPCQ5,Nice,5
B075WTPCQ5,"Last minute purchase for a trip in case I needed something longer than my rain coat. Came in very handy, easy to re-fold and put back in provided pouch when dry. Only drawback is that the snaps under the arms weren't very strong, so it sometimes came unsnapped. Well worth the price!!",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Never used a poncho before so it is a challenge to get into the thing. Zipper works well. Needed something to keep me and my big shoulder bag (mostly) dry while using the bus and this does the job. Material seems a bit thin but this makes it lightweight when packed, so I hope it will hold up in use. Pleased to find that the hood covers my big head. Bright yellow color makes me visible to traffic when crossing streets and parking lots.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Love it! I know it will be perfect for me, not too hot and great coverage.",4
B075WTPCQ5,"We bought two for their convenience, Light weight, and easy to store in a small package.  They store easily in our bike bags and have excellent coverage when seated outdoors.  We've only worn them once but the full length zipper made them so much more convenient than the pull over style.",5
B075WTPCQ5,I only wish it was available in 3XL and multiple sizes to cover backpacks and full length of clothes.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"Bought for a trip to Hershey park with predicted storms looming. They are a thin fabric like nylon- love the zipper, hood is deep enough and has tightening cords, and has zip pockets which was very useful!  Worth the investment for us as we do a lot of outdoor things where we have gotten soaked and that gets old.  We never got poured on this trip but definitely repelled what rain we did have.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"It's a fantastic raincoat. after receiving this one, I bought two more in different colors.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"I bought this specifically for an outdoor concert. Good thing I did because it did rain! It worked amazingly well. I placed it over my rain coat and it was big enough to cover my legs while sitting in a lawn chair. I am 5' tall. This color was bought for my husband, I have the burgundy color. Highy recommend!",5
B075WTPCQ5,"This raincoat has been a fantastic purchase for me. I don't drive so I have to walk to get where I need to go and sometimes nature wants to put a stop to it. I can't just not go to work because of a little weather and I also can't arrive sopping wet, this is perfect. It keeps me wonderfully dry. Paired with a pair of knee high raincoats it leaves very little of my body exposed to the elements. My upper body ends up staying dry even in steady rain. Although I do recommend pairing it with rain boots and an umbrella if you're concerned about your legs, pants, or shoes getting wet. I has love that it comes with a little pouch that adds for easy storage in a bag either inside or clipped on. My biggest gripes with the coat has to be putting it away after use. It can be annoying to fold back properly so it fits in the pouch. Its also not great if you need to put it away quickly. And if you don't store it properly you run the risk of it wetting the items inside your bag (but not to an extreme amount.) My second biggest gripe is probably the hood. I am not sure if it is how the product is made of user error buy I cannot seem to get it to fit to wear I am both staying dry and can see. It seems I have to choose between getting my face and glasses wet or having my vision obstructed. Which can make me feel a little unsafe walking near busy roads but definitely not something that dampers my opinion of the jacket too much. I am also plus size with large hips and chest and the jacket still manages to remain roomy enough that it feels flowy on my body and I can wear my backpack under it. If you need a cute and inexpensive raincoat I definitely recommend giving this a go.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"Great price, the zipper, snaps all worked great. It's kinda cute. I just wore it in Iceland and it did the trick. Kept me dry",5
B075WTPCQ5,Exactly was I needed. Comes with a little bag so you can put it away again to reuse. Durable and stylish.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"If you're spending a week in the rain, it would be great.  But for a one maybe day of rain, for the expense and the weight in the suitcase, I'd just get the dollar store variety if I had to do it over again.  I used some double sided fabric tape to add some plastic to the arm length.  It was a little over-kill for me.  It was perfectly made with all the snaps and zippers functioning properly.  I couldn't get it back in the pouch and put it in a 2.5 gallon ziplock bag instead and used the nice pouch that came with it for some small items (phone cords, etc.)",4
B075WTPCQ5,"This unfortunately came in handy during a hurricane at a camping music festival. I regret many things about that weekend, but this poncho worked well. During one squall, I used a regular raincoat, and my shorts go soaked. Switching to this kept my clothes drier and it wasn't super hot or uncomfortable. I honestly hope this lives out its days in my closet after that experience, but it's good to have on hand.",5
B075WTPCQ5,I am heading to Alaska and was told it is  actually a rain forest so to be prepared- this poncho is well made and has snaps to create sleeves and even has a zipper pocket for your phone we shall see how it holds up,4
B075WTPCQ5,Rain Poncho is compact and useful.  The open front provides good access and ventilates well.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"One of the best things I've bought in a while.I had a thin plastic one that made so much noise it made me paranoid in public! I got this one hoping it wouldn't, and it doesn't. It also covers my arms all the way to my fingertips, doesn't billow in the wind like the other one did, and it has enough snaps down each side to keep my thighs from getting wet. The hood is nicely protective, covering my head with overhang enough to even keep my face dry.All this, and the color is perfect, too!!! Just what I wanted!I recommend it, it worked for me even in a heavy rain! What else do I need a poncho for?",5
B075WTPCQ5,"We travel to Mexico often, including nearly every summer during monsoon season. If you aren't familiar, this is a season when you wake up to a perfectly sunny, beautiful day and head out exploring, but sometime in the late afternoon, the sky will very suddenly fill with purple clouds which proceed to fall in one fell swoop. After a few minutes, half hour, or a few hours, the sky will return to blue, but everything and everyone will be drenched. I've learned to take a rain coat and waterproof shoes on these trips, but my raincoat is bulky. I shove it into a backpack and it takes up most of the space. Then I have to carry a wet coat around after the deluge. Finally, I had the good sense to look for something light and packable and I found this poncho. I'm so excited! This is going to be much easier to pack and carry around, and it has a handy pack to put it back into. I've also been keeping it in my car here in WA State where it rains a ton. Recently, my daughter and I were out and about when it started to pour and, being a teenager, she did not have a jacket. I tossed her the poncho and she stayed warm and dry. She also thought it was stylish, which is saying something. I'm going to buy one for her to keep in her car, too.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"I ordered two of these for a trip to Disney World. The day we went to Animal Kingdom, there was a tornado warning and 100% chance of rain...one of the ponchos I ordered unfolded with ease and protected as expected, just as the torrential downpour threatened! The other poncho was horribly stuck together and took several minutes to unpeel/unstick from itself. Although I did finally get it unstuck, as the rain started in earnest I noticed that my skin (underneath the poncho) was wet anywhere the poncho touched it, and sticky, to boot...I assume maybe there was a defect with the waterproofing? I initially put it down to Florida humidity...until we headed inside for lunch and I took my poncho off. The inside was soaking wet and did not dry (the outside drained off and dried in no time!). The inside was also slick with a sticky layer (similar to when you put hand sanitizer on still-damp hands and it gets goopy). I decided I'd rather take my chances with the rain for the rest of the day.In terms of fit, I do want to note that these are great! They are long and loose, with plenty of room to keep a backpack underneath, and the front zipper + pocket (at least on the poncho that worked) was very useful for keeping humidity down and maximizing airflow in between downpours! The storage bag with a carabiner was also useful for clipping to a backpack and keeping other items dry if put away while still wet.The style and function of these are great...as long as you don't get a defective one!",3
B075WTPCQ5,"My husband,  his sister and I took these on an Alaskan cruise. They were perfect.  They fit well and fold up super small so they don't take up all the room in your  suitcase.  We wore them on a rainy excursion and everyone in line asked about them and wrote  down the order information.  I HIGHLY recommend!",5
B075WTPCQ5,Excellent,5
B075WTPCQ5,"Brought this camping and everyone ended up using it by the end of the trip! The zipper makes it easy to take off without flinging water everywhere. Love the snaps on the sides, but my arms are too long to use the thumb loops.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"If i had to do it again, i would have chosen one with a front closure.  Otherwise, it's a lovely rain poncho.",4
B075WTPCQ5,Unfortunately I had to return the beige (ordered white and received beige). But reordered the same in Navy. Quality is great. Love the fact that you have elastic bands for arms to keep it in place. And the zipper in the front will be great when taking it off.  Will be perfect for my trip to Disney in a couple of weeks.,5
B075WTPCQ5,"I used this when hiking in a rainforest. Packs small so I carried it in my backpack. When the rains came, I had it out and on in a matter of seconds. Kept me dry, covered me and my backpack, and still was able to keep hiking. It was easy to fold up and repack after it dried out. I got the pink polka dots and love them-",5
B075WTPCQ5,"I bought these for my whole family, we are going to Disney World. After much research I bought these, when I got them I was more than happy. I have previously purchased other brands including the cheap ones at the park and was not happy. I'm 5'2 this comes down to mid calf and is perfect, lots of loose room for the hot Florida weather & very light weight. The feel of the fabric is nice, lots of room to move in these & the hood is made nicely. The pocket on the front is placed well and fits the big phones, however it does weigh it down and pull a bit on the shoulder but still okay. You will need to practice a tiny bit to get back into the pouch but still okay, fits into our backpacks easily. Love them!!!",5
B075WTPCQ5,Very nice and fits over light jacket. Kept me dry in Europe,5
B075WTPCQ5,"Easy to fold down and pack for my Alaska cruise.  Packed well and was great size to put in the backpack when heading out on excursions.  Love the snap closure options, comfortable!",5
B075WTPCQ5,"This was a great raincoat for our trip. I love that it has a zipper, so easy to take on and off and cooler. I can see me using this for more than I thought.",5
B075WTPCQ5,"This poncho is great in a heavy rain.  It would work for trying to bring in groceries, taking a hike, keeping dry on vacation when outside.  It has a draw hood to pull up close to your face.  That said, I would not use this as a rain jacket to dress up in for church or a night out, as it is not made to be ""attractive"" in.  It is made really big, like wearing a tent over your clothes and pulling it over your head will just mess up your hair if you are dressed up.  I purchased this, however, as something to wear when I am going to be out in the rain for a long period of time and want to stay dry.  It is perfect for that and very comfortable!  It comes with a pouch to put it in and take with you for vacation or camping.  It is a great buy for any outdoor people who want to stay dry.",5
B075WTPCQ5,Got this for day hiking and concerts. Love that it comes in a little packable pouch with a clip. Came in super handy when we got caught in a down pour at RMNP! Kept me and my pack dry!,5
B09MHS6C6Z,shirts fit nice but more form fitting shirt than a normal large sized shirt.  if it shrinks in the wash it may cause some trouble and i would look like a pumped up teen with invisible Lat syndrome.,4
B09MHS6C6Z,"Great fit and good value, I am a 3X and usually have trouble finding shirts that fit well. Recommend trying these shirts",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Love these! Light weight and comfy!,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Excellent Choice of Products, The Material is Great for Summer Wear or Fall",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Love these shirts but got a 2XL randomly mixed in with my XL pack so quality control isn't the best. They are so cheap it wasn't worth it to return anyway. I love these for office work business casual.,3
B09MHS6C6Z,Great shirts. Honest review. I'll occasionally take a shot at a good deal and accept a not so great outcome. These shirts are a great quality and look real nice for casual dress or golf. I bought a 5 pk and they fit great and look great. I'm 6'2 255..bought 3xl and they fit great.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Great quality, only issue was is that they sent me two of the same color shirt. It was supposed to be 5 different colors. Fast shipping 2 green shirts, I really wanted the tan color one.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,"For the price, these shirts are good quality. I will likely purchase again. Have no experience yet on wash ability and color fastness. They are wrinkle resistant and soft.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,I've had these a few weeks now and no complaints. They are comfortable and pretty affordable when on sale.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"The quality is good for the price, nice variety of colors, not heavy, but also not moisture wicking, wore them underneath my body armor for a class, took forever to dry out, when not wearing it. But a good shirt all in all.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,Good quality good price,5
B09MHS6C6Z,I like these shirts. They are very decent for the money!,4
B09MHS6C6Z,Me agrado. El cuidado el producto para regalar ami familia,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Nice variety of colors and they fit perfectly. True to size,5
B09MHS6C6Z,These are great shirts.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Very nice colors and very light and comfortable,5
B09MHS6C6Z,I took them on a two week trip and could wash and wear them quite easily. As practical and useful while still fitting my work dress code as well.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Great product,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Great fit, and an extra layer keeping ANY deodorant stains from showing on the outside.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,"At first glance, I didn't think they would fit properly.  I was wrong. They fit and feel great.  If you wear an undershirt, go up a size.  I will say it's very breathable material, you can see through it if you hold it up to the light.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Great for with a nice design.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Super happy with the fit and quality of these shirts. Very happily surprised. Will order again.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Nice shirts, sizing runs alittle tight.  I will definetely buy again!",4
B09MHS6C6Z,"Extremely thin material.  Maybe not the greatest for every day wear, but definitely good for vacations and beach days!",4
B09MHS6C6Z,"So far so, shirts are comfortable, size run well. And went through 2 washes and all still well. C",4
B09MHS6C6Z,La tela bonita y los colores no se salen,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Sizing runs small. Whatever size you are ordering 1 size up,4
B09MHS6C6Z,"Decent shirts. Breathable and pretty nice looking, also drys quick. Only bad thing is material is quite coarse and sometimes irritable on skin, specially the star logo on sleeve.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,Soft and breathable,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"The shirts are very comfortable. Few issues though. The buttons on the front are spaced just enough where your either showing too much chest, almost like a deep cut V neck, or its buttoned all the way up. After a few months I've noticed the fabric is coming undone in a few places. Like it got caught in the dryer and pulled the whole thread. For the money, worth it.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,"I really like these Polo Shirts and have a number of them.  I decided to buy this multi-pack because it offered a variety of colors I didn't have.  The quality is there, but sadly one of the polos looked like it had been repacked in a hurry and was heavily crumpled/scrunched up and had to be carefully inspected for damage.  Not what I expected.  I'm a bit concerned I may have a return rather than a new item.  It will be washed and ironed, but for what has been a great brand for me, this was a bit of a downer.",3
B09MHS6C6Z,"Purchased these for my husband and he normally wears large collared shirts, but this were too tight in the shoulders and arms. We returned and ordered the Xlarge, which he wasn't happy with but, the colors are a nice solid true color as shown. The material is thick-ish but very breathable. The length is perfect if needed to be tucked in or the bottom is edged out so you can wear it untucked (active duty military guys). We did get these on sale for about 15 dollars less, but I would pay the full price if the sale wasn't offered. Definitely a great purchase, wished they made more in different shades.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,"These shirts look nice and are comfortable. For true to size, I wear an XL and these fit well and are long enough to stay tucked in.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,"The quality and value are unmatched by anything I've seen in clothing. I've had many compliments on their appearance.  Their comfortable, practical with their pocket for license/credit card, the loop to hold my glasses are also very handy.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,La calidad del producto y la puntualidad de la entrega 100% satisfecho,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Well made good fit. Liked the colors.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,The only thing I wish it had was a pocket up in the front instead of the useless one on the sleeve,4
B09MHS6C6Z,the polo shirts fit the body and the added extra collar sewing helps the collar to stay formed and not flatten out.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"I do not normally write reviews, but I ordered two separate kinds of shirts from Amazon. This one the quality was fantastic and so I ordered five more. The quality cost and delivery for five star.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Easy and simple to care for. Great colors and great fit.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Me encantaron las prendas!!,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Great fitting polo shirts. It's everything I was hoping it would be. Very satisfied and would recommend to my family and friends.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"These shirts aren't heavy. It's nice and not glossy. I bought the pack for when I travel for work. I can wear them tucked or untucked and it still looks good. I wear medium and I bought the mediums and they fit very well. After washing them, they retain their size. I throw it in the washer like any other clothes I have. Nothing special.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Happy with purchase,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Una de las camisa vino el zai  incoresto L y eran todas XL,3
B09MHS6C6Z,I loved the way the shirt looked and felt unfortunately the second something scrapes it it is permanently damaged also not very wrinkle resistant,2
B09MHS6C6Z,The shirts are nice for the price but are wrinkly after being washed.,3
B09MHS6C6Z,These shirts are cool and comfortable in hot weather!,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Shirts are very comfortable and has a great quality. Heat value for the price. I would but them again.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Fits as described,5
B09MHS6C6Z,it is great,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Wrinkle free. Fit right in all the right places. I'm 5'10' and 230lbs. Look great!,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Breathable and very comfortable, worth every penny!",5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Good fit,  comfy material. Had 3 of them and ordered the 5 pack! Great value for the money!",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Camisetas con excelente acabado y sobretodo en talla correcta.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Bought these shirts with the intent on wearing for work. The size chart showed a xxl would fit nicely. When I tried the first one it was skin tight.,3
B09MHS6C6Z,I'm a heavy guy and the shirts fit well.  Not too tight and not too baggy.  Long enough to tuck in but not so long you can't wear them untucked.  I will buy more.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"The fabric easily catches on things and gets little tufts that stick out. They're great for the price, but if you leave a desk you're going to ruin them quickly.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,"The shirts are nice, but i think they made the back of the neck too tall, i feel like i have no neck haha. other than that, they are nice!",3
B09MHS6C6Z,Any shirt that is above xl needs to have a Tall size.  longer tails,3
B09MHS6C6Z,"Got this for my BF, he said they are comfortable and breathable material.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,Excellent quality. I will be ordering more.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,love the fit and the colors I purchased. They feel comfortable and I like the shoulder pocket and sunglass holder.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,The fit and comfort. The color were great. Will have to see if they shrink in the wash.,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Muy bonitas mis camisas,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Great product!Fast Delivery,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"I started to wear this. Polos planning ahead for a trip, the trial went well, the fabric felt right no to hot no to  light, but the best part was when watching the polos, the fabric just dry in a few hours in the bathroom. I will recommend.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,MUI bien,5
B09MHS6C6Z,I love these shirts they fit well they look good I plan on ordering more,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Nice fit,5
B09MHS6C6Z,When cost matters and comfort is a concern this product fits the bill.  Definitely the best bang for your buck.,4
B09MHS6C6Z,The shirts were very nice and came early,5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Very high quality product, comfortable and has great wicking performance. The shipping packaging is the only knock against the product. It came in a Ziploc Bag with a shipping label.Will place more orders for this exact product",5
B09MHS6C6Z,"these shirts are amazing. My son Has Autism, I bought them for him to wear to school, usually when he gets home he removes other shirts but these he can stay in them all day. They are care free, just wash and place in a hanger. They're great for living in south Florida.Love them.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,"Got a notice it was running late on delivery, but was way sooner than expected  so no worries. I ordered a 2x and it fits more like a 1x, just looser in the mid section, which is ok. They all are great color wise... except the tan... which looks more like a mustard color. But for the price I guess I can't complain much.",4
B09MHS6C6Z,"I ordered these shirts needing something for work and for a training I was going to for four days. These shirts are true to size fit at least for me. I'm a 3X and it's harder to find shirts that are not snugged and not bigger than what I want. Material is great, packaging is great and the fitment was great. Will definitely order more.",5
B09MHS6C6Z,An XL should be pretty large. These look like they were still made for a teenage golf league. I got XL because people said they ran on the larger size. But those all most have been small people. I dunno. I thought a more combative polo would have more room in the shoulders. But these are more fashionable than practical. Shame.,2
B09MHS6C6Z,El cuello se deforma o arruga,4
B09MHS6C6Z,Good products,5
B09MHS6C6Z,Bought these for work had stitching put on with product and company name $15 a shirt. These shirt literally will snag on velcro very disappointed!,2
B09MHS6C6Z,I was very disappointed with the material. I expected a smooth soft feeling I get with polyester and spandex.  These shirts definitely do not feel like that they are rough.  I would have returned them except it is such a hassle as I work  overseas.,1
B07GV3WZG7,"Previously my most successful tactic for coping with sweaty toes has been to combine some sheer liner sock with a thicker, poofy sock. Then wear wider, roomier, ventilated shoes or sandals.  Some socks advertised as ""wicking away moisture"" work somewhat as described and they work best with this scheme.The ""Amazing Premium Bamboo Socks"" have worked out just as well.  Which is to say, one's toes do not feel as moist.  Ninety-eight percent drier, maybe. No need to double these up with a second sock. They are neither sheer nor particularly thick.  They are quite soft to the touch, and light, but nevertheless feel like a substantial sock.  The larger size feels sort of grippy on my Size 10 feet but the elastic does not feel too tight.You can get a nice selection of four colors.  You probably will get a lot of wear out of these.  ""Bamboo"" socks -- made from a rayon substance based on a chemical derived from actual bamboo -- are probably worth your while.  Not disappointed in any way.",5
B07GV3WZG7,I find these pair of socks very comfortable. I will be looking into buying another pair.,5
B07GV3WZG7,"These are nice socks but they aren't what I expected to get. I reordered socks, I really like, and got socks that are nothing like the original ones.The problem, for me, is the band at the top of the cuff. It hold the socks up but it is tight on my legs. My other socks don't have a band so they don't cut into my legs.My lower legs are probably larger than most women, as I was very active in sports, and have a lot of muscle in my legs, so I have to wear the socks scrunched down around my ankles, if I plan to wear the socks all day. On the plus side, if I'm just going to be wearing them for a few hours, I can pull them up and they work well and look nice.I think these socks are meant to be an improvement over the original socks I bought and I think, for most women, they will work just fine. They are definitely far better than dozens of other socks I've bought over the years and the color assortment, of navy, black, and tan, meets all my color needs so I will probably buy them again even though they aren't what I hoped to get when I reordered socks.",4
B07GV3WZG7,"Soft and luxurious but, rips easily and found a bit itchy maybe it traps bacteria too easily had to throw them out eventually",3
B07GV3WZG7,"My sensory- sensitive kid likes these socks because the seams are very small, and the fabric is smooth.",5
B07GV3WZG7,Good material and not too bulky. Enough stretch but not too tight.,5
B07GV3WZG7,After 10 months a lot of my socks are starting to get holes in them. To be fair I do dance occasionally in my socks but they seem to go bad a little bit faster,3
B07GV3WZG7,"The material is very soft, thin and stretchy. And it seems to hold up pretty well. I bought these because they are smooth on the calf rather than ribbed. My gribe is that they are too short by 1-2"". They are more dress sock height than Crew Socks. And since they are short, tend to creep down and become even shorter. If there was a version 2"" taller I'd buy again but the search continues.",4
B07GV3WZG7,Great fit and quality,5
B07GV3WZG7,"Got them for a man's size 10 but they are tight, get a larger size. I wear them, women's 8, and they are ok.",4
B07GV3WZG7,They don't really stay up well but you get what you pay for.  They do the job.,3
B07GV3WZG7,Very good texture (75-80% Rayon with Bamboo) but top edge a little tight.,4
B07GV3WZG7,"I like these better than the ones in COSTCO, good quality",5
B07GV3WZG7,"I loved the socks, but after one wash it already looked used. Upsetting.",3
B07GV3WZG7,"These socks are comfortable. They are so soft, the quality is amazing. Definitely will be buying more!",5
B07GV3WZG7,"I am a size 13, so it is actually really hard to find socks that fit. I initially bought these to wear with my suit and have been wearing them for years since I bought this purchase. They haven't developed any holes and are very stretchy so my toes don't feel tied down. 10/10 would buy again.",5
B07GV3WZG7,"Only had them for a few weeks. So far, so good. Very comfortable.",5
B07GV3WZG7,Great men's socks! My husband has to wear dress shoes to work and these socks are perfect. They're nice and thin and a goof value for the price.,5
B07GV3WZG7,"My one complaint is that they feel a bit thin, and are slightly too tight on my feet, since I'm used to looser fitting socks. However, this bamboo material is the real deal, and my socks just... don't stink. It's a great material for people who value hygiene, but aren't obsessive about hygiene - you know who you are. : )",4
B07GV3WZG7,Reallying liking these socks. Very comfortable.,5
B07GV3WZG7,"Socks are an overlooked part of many men's wardrobe. Having these staple colors ensure that you have the socks to coordinate with almost any outfit. It's a simple way to make sure you're presenting yourself in the best way possible. And they're very soft!! I mean, super soft and breathable. If you have a man in your life who wears sports socks with everything, buy them a pack!",5
B07GV3WZG7,"Finally,  socks I really like. Not too tight, not too loose. Just about perfect for a great price!",5
B07GV3WZG7,"I bought these 2 times. Originally for my husband but ended up getting more for me as well. Warm, very soft and comfy. Love them.",5
B07GV3WZG7,Love slipping these socks on every day.,5
B07GV3WZG7,I wish they had these socks when I was a kid...They are the best socks I've ever bought.,5
B07GV3WZG7,Soft and comfortable while not making my feet hot at work.  Fantastic socks.  Only problem is that they tear easily if you do not maintain your toenails.,5
B07GV3WZG7,"Years ago, I purchased some socks made by Chaps They were bamboo and very comfortable. Since they are no longer available, I went in search of new bamboo socks. After trying several brands, I found these to be the best for fit and comfort.",5
B07GV3WZG7,"I have ordered this socks twice since the quality is excellent, very soft and flexible material",5
B07GV3WZG7,I've now bought the black and white long thin dress socks and i have to say that I love them! Super comfy and breathable socks with the added benefit from the bamboo of not stinking after a long hot day of wearing non breathable shoes! Recommend people to check out the sizing chart before buying to get their best fitting size :) 10/10  great socks,5
B07GV3WZG7,"Liked the feel of this comfortable sock.For normal ankles, the fit is tight around the cuff.  We will work on stretching the top of the sock tocomplete satisfaction.",4
B07GV3WZG7,"Socks lasted but about a year and half before having holes around the toes. I would estimate each sock being worn and washed approximately 15 times. These socks are very thin (borderline see through), similar texture and lower quality than suit style socks. May need to be washed on delicate modes. The pros are that they are 100% black, have not faded, and elasticity has held up.",2
B07GV3WZG7,"In several wear cycles and washings, nothing bad has happened yet. These are my thin socks, for special occasions and hot days (or under heavy socks on cold days, but it hasn't been cold since I got them).The elastic stretches a long way and snaps back, and still does that after a few washings at least. The texture is as I remember  Rayon socks I had decades ago, back when Rayon was exciting.",5
B07GV3WZG7,Fit,5
B07GV3WZG7,"My Gold Toe dress socks were getting long in the tooth and needed to be replaced.  I thought I'd give bamboo socks a try.  These socks are NO JOKE!  I wear them to work every day, and they have went through multiple washes - and still feel as soft and ""fresh"" as the day I took them out of the package.  No fading.  No shrinkage or expanding.  Still perfectly shaped.These bamboo socks feel great on your feet and are easy to slide on and off.  They are ultra thin and breathable.  Without shoes, you feel barefoot.  Needless to say, I bought more and threw all my old socks in the trash... which also simplified my sock sorting chore.  Cotton based socks are dead to me.",5
B07GV3WZG7,The socks are comfortable but thin and almost slippery in the shoes. They do NOT feel like regualr cotton socks. I wear a size 11.5 shoes and the footbed fits well but they fall down on the calf.,3
B07GV3WZG7,Feel comfortable and keep my feet from sweating in work boots. After one wash I got a hole in a single sock. Probably a bad stitch so 4 star for quality control.,4
B07GV3WZG7,"I've ordered socks from other sellers before, but these socks are really comfortable, they don't burn my feet either, they're comfortable for those who work in the restaurant for a long time like me, thank you",5
B07GV3WZG7,They fit great and have quality materials,5
B07GV3WZG7,The socks are soft and feel good but are very thin.  There is no cushion to them at all.,4
B07GV3WZG7,Perfect,5
B07GV3WZG7,I love these the softness of the fabric along the fit. - and they stay up rather than sliding down my leg.,5
B07GV3WZG7,Love the feel and fit. Tops to tight for my legs but cut them shorter and bingo works for me,4
B07GV3WZG7,I have a size 12 1/2 4E foot. They really are still a little small for big feet.,4
B07GV3WZG7,great product,4
B07GV3WZG7,"I got these socks for my 95-year-old husband. He doesn't wear closed shoes anymore, since he uses a wheelchair when he goes outdoors. He has some black leather sandals instead. We were going to our grandson's wedding, so I bought these socks to wear with the sandals. They felt really comfy when I opened the package, and fit well and looked good with the sandals. It's hard to say much about black socks,  but if you want some neutral socks that are soft feeling and good quality, these should fit the bill.",5
B07GV3WZG7,But I like them and chew thru them but just keep reordering them constantly,4
B07GV3WZG7,These sockes are the softest most comfortable socks I have ever owned.  I also like that they are not thick but they are comfortable year round.  Did I say  they are soft??,5
B07GV3WZG7,Purchased as real soft thick product of which is not true,4
B07GV3WZG7,Launder very well. Nice looking and comfortable,5
B07GV3WZG7,"If you want a slip and slide everywhere you walk, these are for you.",2
B07GV3WZG7,"Yeah, I fell for it! I thought I would receive 8 pairs, bit I only got 4. The socks are fine. They fit, they're soft, a little thin, but they're okay.",2
B07GV3WZG7,"Comfy socks, affordable, no matter how much you wash them they leave little black lint all over the house is my only complaint",3
B07GV3WZG7,Thinner socks for sure but they do feel really amazing!,4
B07GV3WZG7,These come out of  the wash like the softest socks ever,5
B07GV3WZG7,"There's a recent trend now with socks, maybe just the ones you buy online.  Probably to save a fraction of a cent per pair, the maximum circumference they stretch to is significantly smaller than what was standard in the past.  These socks are an example.  So they are in fact bamboo.  But it's a little bit of a pain to work them on around my ankle and heel.  And they are tight on my leg, just short of being a real problem.  So not really comfortable, and most definitely not a luxurious or quality feel.",3
B07GV3WZG7,Will order more,5
B07GV3WZG7,VERY comfortable,5
B07GV3WZG7,All good nice soft fit and stay dry,4
B07GV3WZG7,Like the fit and materials,5
B07GV3WZG7,"I wanted to love these socks! They were very soft, very thin, and comfortable except at the top where the band was way too tight. Even if I pushed them down to my ankle, they were too tight, making band marks around my ankles. I'm sorry that I had to return them.",4
B07GV3WZG7,"Love these socks. Super soft, no inside hems or strings irritating. Will only buy these from now on.",5
B07GV3WZG7,"Super comfortable, durable black dress sock.  I love a plain black sock with black shoes that I wear all the time.  I would definitely recommend these and I would order them again.  I love them!",5
B07GV3WZG7,While I still won't be going back to cotton socks these felt incredibly thin compared to other bamboo socks that I have. They fit well though I haven't had any issues with the fact that they are seemingly smaller than most of the other socks as well as they do stretch to fit but because of how thin they are it just feels off to me.,3
B07GV3WZG7,"Pro: super soft and comfortableCon: they don't stay upI'm constantly having to pull these back up, they just won't stay",2
B07GV3WZG7,Just what I was looking for,5
B07GV3WZG7,"they fit a bit too tight, also comfortable.",4
B07GV3WZG7,"They are much more like thin short dress socks than gold toes, but I guess it now has that tip in the product page about bamboo socks. My experience with super stretchy socks is that eventually the all ride down, so I didn't really give them a chance. Maybe in the future I'll give bamboo socks a go again.",3
B07GV3WZG7,"I absolutely love these socks , I have trouble with my feet and these are fantastic , they are well made and I will be ordering more",5
B07GV3WZG7,The sizing of these socks are way too small.  Size 10-13 will barely fit on my feet and are very tight and leaves indentation around my leg at the top.  The fabric does not stretch very well and is stiff and hard.,1
B07GV3WZG7,I'm a nurse and I've been buying the sock amazing brand from Amazon for a few years now I've gotten to where they're the only socks I'll even wear to work there's so much cooler and lighter weight and more comfortable than anything else,5
B07GV3WZG7,So soft! Will not buy any crew socks except these in the future - that is how comfortable and long lasting they are.,5
B07GV3WZG7,"I love the feel of bamboo socks, they are really soft and comfortable. These pairs are much thicker than I expected. Good for spring/fall/winter but it might be too thick for summer. Good neutral colors too.",4
B07GV3WZG7,"The socks are soft, stretch lengthwise is outstanding, stretch widthwise is adequate. These tend to be a more on the order of support socks with enough grip to stay up in place. These are not as stretchy as some diabetic socks which I had to wear due to swelling, but these work well for me now.",5
B07GV3WZG7,I love these socks. They are SO soft and they're thin enough that my feet don't feel bound in shoes with thick socks. They seem insulated. They keep me warm but also let them breathe.,5
B07GV3WZG7,Wear them.,4
B07GV3WZG7,They feel more like dress socks.,2
B07GV3WZG7,"Product is not good for wide feet.  I am a size 10.5 and the sock was already too tight.  After a wash in cold water,  and 5 minutes in a cool dryer, I could not get them on my feet.  Gave them to my little nephew.  Was outside of the return window or they would have gone back.",3
B07GV3WZG7,Bought wrong socks. But I need these too! So look good for dress and feel comfy.,3
B07GV3WZG7,It came in record time.They are the best socks soft and warm.,5
B07GV3WZG7,"Wow! I put them on today and they are perfect! They cover my calves and they feel like compression socks, but they are not. They are easy to put on and they are not tight. I simply love them. I feel like my feet and legs are being pampered. Simply amazing socks.",5
B07GV3WZG7,As described,5
B07GV3WZG7,"I did end up returning these. These are more like thin dress socks, which is not what I was looking for. The quality of the socks was fine, they were soft, they just weren't the thicker socks I was looking for. But the overall quality was good.",5
B07GV3WZG7,Soft and thin. Perfect for work or play. Will be ordering more!,5
B07GV3WZG7,These are just plain ole black socks. That's all I wanted and I got them. They are a good value,5
B07GV3WZG7,"I bought these for my husband as he's got some vascular issues and needed something more nurturing than just the crappy cotton blend at Costco. I have to admit I've been stealing them because they are so soft and warm!! He loves them, and they don't constrict his ankles in one spot like Kirkland brand socks did. Will buy lots more for the fam.",5
B07GV3WZG7,Great and comfortable socks but they tend to get holes quickly. Something should down to strengthen them.,3
B07GV3WZG7,Gift ask but told they are good fit and comfortable.,5
B07GV3WZG7,Gave these as a gift and he said they are the most comfortable socks he's ever worn!,5
B0B728NH19,Shirts were as nice in person as they were on line.  Great fit and very comfortable. Good quality and price.,5
B0B728NH19,"Good shirts. Fit well, look nice",4
B0B728NH19,"I'm a big guy trying to stave off a Santa belly and it's been hard finding a shirt to wear while trying to be active.  These are fantastic!Very comfortable, fits well, nice and long, stretchy, and even rather stylish.  I bought a second pack, hopefully by the end of summer I'll buy a couple more in a smaller size.",5
B0B728NH19,"Maybe I didn't read the description accurately, but I though I was getting 5 of the same shirts, but with different designs. Turns out it's 5 shirts with different designs, but different styles and cuts. Not a deal breaker. 2 shirts have gussets that run down the armpit the full length of the shirt. 2 have gussets that are in the shape of a V or spear head from the armpit almost the full length and those are a tight mesh. The last just the thin material. They all fit fine. I usually wear a Large Tall, unless I can find an XL that has a good length and these do. (Ordered XL). The first two I mentions are heavier material than all the other and those are labeled as running shirts with reflective material. I gave it 5 stars as I did want different shirts (looks) but did end up getting ""different"" shirts. I like! So if you were looking for 5 shirts of the same style but in different colors, these are not them. We'll see how they hold up.",5
B0B728NH19,"Best quality workout shirt I ever bought at an affordable price! The color, the neckline, its warmth and softness as well as clinginess are all superb!  Will definitely buy again and more from this shop!",5
B0B728NH19,My husband wears a 3x. These are very nice quality. The best thing is they are not overly long as he is of shorter stature and most shirts that are 3x tend to run long in the body almost the length of a dress. These are the perfect length. He also likes the material.,5
B0B728NH19,"These are nice shirts.  I got the 5 pack in white, and they are each slightly different in style, color, pattern, etc.  I am tall with a 44"" chest, and XL fit fine, with a little room to spare.  The XL's measure 31"" long (top of collar to bottom of hem) which is good for me, but might be a bit long for shorter guys.  Satisfied with the purchase.",5
B0B728NH19,"Finally a shirt that lives up to its claim. I am a shorter guy only 5'6"" but this shirt doesn't rise above my waist when I raise my arms over my head. So if you also have this problem or just want a shirt that fits like a shirt should. You can not go wrong here.",5
B0B728NH19,Maybe more of a 3.5 star. The shirts are well made with a good fit. True to size. I bought these to workout in but the material is a bit too thick/doesn't breathe well. I was hoping for something more like a UA shirt.,4
B0B728NH19,"Using this for running/cycling, perfect fit and quick dry technology helps keeping you dry and comfy during and after sports. 5/5",5
B0B728NH19,Finally a shirt that fits like an XXL Should.  Not super soft but I like them because they are longer than average shirts.,4
B0B728NH19,"These T shirts are made of a nice breathable material, however, they are very well made and they have held up fine after many washes. I use them for pickleball and hiking.",5
B0B728NH19,"Great looking set of shirts, lightweight material, comfortable perfect fit! Good value with great colors!",5
B0B728NH19,This product is exactly the way it is on the website. The size fits well on this one.,5
B0B728NH19,"I wear 3X shirts are long. Enough, and my belly doesn't stick out. Nice shirts.",4

B0B728NH19,Material and shirts is amazing,5
B0B728NH19,"I'm 5'11"" about 208lbs with a 44"" chest and 38"" waist. I am at the border of Large and XL so I bought both and found the Large were just a bit too smalll and the XL the right fit for me. I like shirts that fit (i.e. aren't baggy and too big). The fabric is high quality, the cut/sewing also is high quality and I really like the designs.  5 shirts for about $8 each is a fantastic deal.  Liberty Pro has been one of my go-to for athletic wear in addition to Neleus. I have had no issues with either brand and I would recommend to anyone. I want one more set of the V neck versions, but they are out of stock and I check almost daily for them to restock.  Let's go Liberty Pro - I have money to spend!",5

B08BG86NB7,"Best jacket I've had in a long time. I bought it for work, I work outside cutting trees must of the time and it works great, really stands up to the abuse.",5
B08BG86NB7,"I have been looking at getting a durable outerwear jacket for a few years now. After trying on my son's Medium J130 (also from Carhartt) I got to trying on jackets from a few makers, including some pretty good, lower-priced offerings here on Amazon. My son's J130 is more loose-fitting than this relaxed-fit sherpa-lined jacket, but both keep you very warm in cool and cold, as well as windy weather. Neither are waterproof. This Medium-Regular (not Tall) Sherpa-Lined Relaxed fit coat is longer in the back, and fits over the waist on me. I am 5' 10"" ~200 pounds with a 35-inch waist, and this fits me much better than the J130. The hood volume, and arm and body length are all perfectly placed on me. Be aware that while the sleeves have storm cuffs, there is no waist cinch or cuff on this coat, so some people might have body heat leaks there. Everything seems very well constructed. The zipper is smooth and easy to engage, dye on the outer fabric is even and saturated, and the sherpa lining is in the hood and body, while quilted polyester is in the sleeves, which makes putting it on easy without grabbing any garments you might have on underneath. The front outer pockets have full flannel lining, and the inner and outer storage pockets are large and zippered. It breathes well, so I don't feel overheated in it. I wore it around the house for a day before deciding that I wanted to keep it, and never got too hot in it. The lower-priced ones I tried from other makers were good, and more than worth their price, but they were not up to the quality of this jacket.",5
B08BG86NB7,This quickly became my all time favorite jacket. I love the feel of the outer fabric. I love the soft warmth of the interior. I love how many pockets there are and their locations.  I love the hood.17 degrees here where I live.The jacket makes it tolerable; Makes it comfortable. Makes me warm.And looks cool.Thank you Carhartt.,5
B08BG86NB7,"Purchased this jacket for my grandson, excellent quality and sizing. It was well worth the price and I know he will be warm this winter. The delivery was exceptional.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Perfect jacket!! Made of quality material, keeps you warm!!! nice zippers, its My new favorite jacket",5
B08BG86NB7,"This is a very well-made and good-looking jacket. The pockets are in the right place, and the zipper opens and closes without any problems. It looks like it will last me a long time. I am 5'4"", 148 lbs., and I got small.",5
B08BG86NB7,Typical Carhartt product of good quality and seems to be warm with the lining. I wear a four XL usually and this fits me perfect for working around the property or during harsh weather.,4
B08BG86NB7,"I ordered a 4xlarge,as  my chest is larger then most.I love the jacket,I ordered black.If there had been a 5xlarge I would of ordered that one and probly returned it as it would be to big.",5
B08BG86NB7,"I love this coat it's the best coat Ive ever had, but be carful when you order it because they do run large. I'm 6.3 210 pounds thin and muscular and wear XL shirts and coats but this was just to big and knowing this was a coat to keep for many years I went with a large / long and it fit me perfectly and I am very happy.Amazon is great to deal with.",5
B08BG86NB7,should have orderrn them for one sixe smaller but still warm i love carharts worn them for 35 years this is my 3rd coat!,5
B08BG86NB7,"Hard to say anything bad about Carhartt. Not first go around with Carhartt. I like the jacket, and it is exactly what I expected it to be. I got it a little to late ware it outside today. I did test fit inside and the pockets are padded, the zippers are heavy duty, and the price was fair. I'm good with it.",4
B08BG86NB7,"As a smaller framed women, I wanted a baggy loose fit jacket that allowed layers. It is warmer than expected and love how the sleeves have an inner sleeve at the wrist to keep the cold out and warmth in and the sleeves in place. I plan to be creative and wear this in fashionable ways other than the official use of this.",5
B08BG86NB7,The quality is amazing. This is my first carhartt jacket. I previously bought two other canvas jackets from other companies. One fell apart in three days and the others zipper was getting stuck. This Carhartt brand is definitely the best,5
B08BG86NB7,Nice quality and it looks great. You might want to size down the jacket runs a little big,5
B08BG86NB7,Me encanta,5
B08BG86NB7,Cold winters here in Ohio. Perfect coat for me,5
B08BG86NB7,Son was very happy with gift,5
B08BG86NB7,Runs a little big.,5
B08BG86NB7,"Awesome Jacket, haven't had a nice Carhart in a while. They are always worth the money and last forever. Zipper gets stuck sometimes but not really an issue. Read the description about sizing before purchasing, luckily I made the right decision.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Great quality, true to size",5
B08BG86NB7,"Love this coat, perfect for the winter and snow blowing.",5
B08BG86NB7,My son ABSOLUTELY love it! Size was perfect!,5
B08BG86NB7,My Crews love the new coats and say they are very warm and durable.,5
B08BG86NB7,Perfect construction jacket.  Very warm.  Sleeves seal at wrist very comfortable.,5
B08BG86NB7,"I got this for my partner and he was very happy. With how cold this season has been, it makes a big difference.",5
B08BG86NB7,Great for outdoor winter temperatures. Blocks winds and keeps you warm.,5
B08BG86NB7,"Very nice.  Great fit, looks good.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Wish the Inariinterior of the coat was lined with sherpa. good zipper, not waterproof, Fits great, heavy,its half sherpa and half duck lined.",4
B08BG86NB7,"As expected with Carthartt, very nice. Roomy, warm and fits a big larger to size which is expected. Only suggestions that I would offer: zippered pockets in front and a much HEAVIER DUTY ZIPPER!",4
B08BG86NB7,I've been wearing this jacket for years. I just retired my old one after 7 years. Bought a new one and I love it.,5
B08BG86NB7,Very warm,5
B08BG86NB7,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            i have dark brown carhartt size L is a very light weight jacket that keeps you toasty warm. Quality is outstanding, great fit I loved",5
B08BG86NB7,Great coat,5
B08BG86NB7,"I purchased this for my Husband. He is super fussy when it comes to clothes, especially jackets. I have had to return so much stuff over the years that he just doesn't like for some reason or other. However, he loved this jacked from the moment he saw it and it is true to size and fits great. Very happy!",5
B08BG86NB7,"Muy buena calidad, llego antes de tiempo.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Bought for my son.  He said he keeps him extremely warm.  And most carhartt coats are stiff when you 1st get them,  this coat wasn't.  My 17 year old loves the coat.",5
B08BG86NB7,"It's a regular jacket basically.it works but it's not that warm and I am in the south.zipper is good,weight is med heavy but so much more brands out there better than this version of Carhartt for the money. There's no strings at the bottom to pull to tighten up the bottom of the jacket when the wind blows and the inside layer that touches your skin is that shiny cheap material. For the price,it should have came with better insulation also. It's not worth the price.",3
B08BG86NB7,"Durable, warm and great fit.",5
B08BG86NB7,"It was time to retire my old Dickies I've been wearing for the last 9 years. I work 13 hour shifts overnight in a big warehouse in the pacific nw that gets pretty cold inside at night during winter (about 30-40F) and I like to take my breaks outside in fresh air. Temperature gets as low as 20F in winter and I wanted a jacket that would keep me warm for this range while allowing for moderate work activity without having to take it off for overheating (as my Dickies allowed)I chose this Carhartt because it looked a lot like my Dickies but I wanted an upgrade as well in build quality. The Carhartt warmth rating system mentions nothing about temperatures, just 1 to 4 (warm to extreme)I guessed 4 (extreme) to be near zero to sub zero Temps which I've never experienced here so I crossed that off the list.This jacket is rated 3 warmest. I guessed it would fall right into the range I was looking at (20-50F) with some light-moderate activity.It was just above 50F the day this was delivered. Let me tell you now, this jacket is super warm and comfy. I put it on and thought yeah this could work. I took it out for a grocery run and get a better feel for it. Just wandering around the store for10 minutes I could feel the heat on my back building (just had a t-shirt on underneath) felt like I was getting slow roasted. Carhartt does not kid around when it comes to keeping you warm. I wonder what their extreme rated jackets can do...Long story short I already own a jacket that fills the job this one does so I'm returning it and am going to try the Bartlett warmth rated 2 (warmer) instead. Will post a review on that when I get it. Carhartt, seriously great quality.",5
B08BG86NB7,my favorite jacket,5
B08BG86NB7,"Coincidentally this email asking how i felt about jacket came on the evening i first put on this jacket. It was about 12 degrees Celsius here in UK, a bit windy and cooler but the jacket was very warm and i immediately felt it needed even much cooler temperatures. Its a jacket worth one investing their money in.",5
B08BG86NB7,the sizes are smaller than measurement chart,4
B08BG86NB7,"Very sturdy jacket, more of a shell than a comfy hoody. Looks nice. Quite large fit, so will be okay with garments underneath.",5
B08BG86NB7,Awesome,5
B08BG86NB7,Carhartt is the best coat and I highly recommend it for everyone. Very warm coat and it's very well made.,5
B08BG86NB7,Highly recommend,5
B08BG86NB7,"I like how it's super thick and warm making it perfect for cold weather. I live in the PNW and it gets very cold here during the winter. I bought a size Medium. For reference I'm a woman, I weigh about 192lbs , standing at 5'4.",5
B08BG86NB7,good product,5
B08BG86NB7,"Size is perfect, plenty of movement in the arms, I love Carhartt",5
B08BG86NB7,The only things i wasnt crazy about is how quickly it list its color on the first wash and these jackets run big. Im stuck between wanting a smaller size. But it would be too small. But OVERALL I LOVE THIS JACKET!!!!!,4
B08BG86NB7,This coat hem was above my waist.  I don't usually require a long version of coats.  Very short.  I sent it back for a long one.,3
B08BG86NB7,"I really am liking this Carhartt coat, but the teeny weeny little zipper they put on a jacket of this type is outrageous.  It's hard to even find it to get it started, and if it's dark and your hands are cold, it's very difficult.  At least it's a brass zipper. I have a different type of Carhartt jacket and it has a normal sized zipper on it, so I'm not sure what they were thinking here.  I am 6'5"", 275 lbs, big shoulders, big chest, and I ordered my normal size which is 3XL tall, and it fits perfectly.  A little loose with room to layer when it really gets cold, which is what I prefer, and the length is great on the torso and sleeves. Covers my butt and comes down over my wrists with some to spare.  The sleeves could definitely use more insulation in them, as the cold starts coming through almost immediately which you can feel on your arms even with layering.  Other than that, this jacket is pretty good, and it's definitely worth buying.  Good jacket. Not perfect...but I still like it a lot, and it's already becoming one of my favorites. I can move around in it and work without feeling confined or constricted.",4
B08BG86NB7,"I had an old Carhartt jacket that was a near twin to this one, albeit with snap buttons instead of a zipper. It survived abuse, blood, torrential rain, snow, and getting thrown in the wash on several occasions.The zipper is a welcome replacement to the snap buttons. It's a little warmer in poor weather, and honestly quicker to connect.Every ounce of weight and lining feels like it will live up to the legacy of its forebears, and it makes its ancestors proud.",5
B08BG86NB7,Great quality and is very warm. Worth the price,5
B08BG86NB7,"**update: changed to 5 stars. despite my initial thoughts and review, my son loves this jacket, he doesn't care if the length is a little short, he just really appreciates the overall durability of the brand.  We live in the rugged rural wilderness and all of his clothes have to be tough, Carhartt never disappoints with long-term durability. The jacket that this one is replacing is three years old and has every color of stain, and grease spot on it that you can imagine a guy living in the forest and working on cars can have but there is not one rip, one thread pulled and the zipper is holding strong. .Initial review:  For quality, it's a great jacket, the zipper, and seams are strong and well-made. The shape is horrible! If you lift up your arms it raises up past your belly. If you bend over it raises above your lower back. These need to be longer! I bought it for my son who is almost 6 ft but pretty slim...I wish they had the medium-tall size but they don't for some reason so I tried this one. Can't they just add a little length?",5
B08BG86NB7,I thought it would be just like in the pic but it's not.thw bottom is gigantic compared to the photo.all in all ita  great jacket just disappointing,3
B08BG86NB7,"I love this coat!! This is the first Sherpa lined coat I have ever owned. It is unbelievably soft, warm, and EXTREMELY comfortable. 10/10 I would recommend to others. This is my new favorite winter coat, hands down. I wish I could have bought one years ago.I have owned one other Carhartt jacket in the past, and it lasted YEARS with heavy use and abuse. So, when I decided to buy a new winter coat, I knew which brand to choose. Carhartt.Believe the hype. There's a reason why they are one of the most popular work wear clothing brands on the market.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Fits well, looks good, and is just the right weight for the not particularly cold nights of SoCal.",4
B08BG86NB7,Fits great love it,5
B08BG86NB7,"While I was surprised to see the last XL available in this awesome green color had to be shipped to Arizona and took a few days to get here, it was worth every minute of that wait. Over the past few years I have looked to Carhartt for tough, durable, practical, and comfortable clothing items that just flat out get the job done. Once again I have had my expectations blown off the shelf. The jacket fits nearly to perfection, and my only complaint would be the style of the sleeves, which is in fact 110% practical for working in the field and staying dry, but I prefer to roll the duck up and have my sleeve cuff visible. Aside from this personal and 100% cosmetic preference, this is the warmest jacket I may have ever owned, sitting right up there with previous North Face and Colombia down jackets I have owned. Currently feels like 30 here in NC and has been in the low 20s all week. I have removed the necessity to double up on a hoodie and jacket combo as now I can literally have a t-shirt on and throw this jacket on to step out for some air and let the dogs out and be TOASTY while doing so! Long rant but seriously 10/10 jacket worth every penny and I would recommend to any and all that are looking for the highest quality North American products that money can buy. This jacket is on that list no doubt about it.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Bought one of these locally fifteen plus years ago and still wear it all the time around our acreage.  Yes, it has some tractor grease stains that won't come out and is a bit frayed in places, but it's still a great coat.  So much so I just bought a second one to keep onboard my boat even though it is not exactly your typical marine wear.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Really comfortable and warm jacket. I wanted to buy original Carhartt item for a pretty long period and was absolutely happy to wear it this winter. Temperatures was from 20F to 50F and it felt comfortable with sweater or long sleeve. The only disappointing thing that it is made for dad's belly and lower part of body is not tight so sometimes was cold after long walks. But this is not critical, 5 stars anyway.L size (normal length) fits well on me 5'9 and 198lbs.",5
B08BG86NB7,"My 6'6 300lbs bf complained he needed a new work jacket; I'll tell you, Carhart NEVER fails for big guys like him. True to size; Its soft on the inside and durable on the outside, the warmth it gives absolutely helps with our harsh winters!10/10",5
B08BG86NB7,"I got this for my grandson for Christmas. He loved it! It fit him very well, with a little room to grow so he can maybe get two years of use before he grows out of it. The jacket is warm and stylish. He likes the Sherpa lining and the attached hood. We have been buying Carhartt for many years, this one seems like it should last a long time. I will update my review if any problems arise.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Its warm, fits perfectly and it looks nice! I only use it when its cold here in Florida (Not Many times a year) I bought it last year and it has holes all over as if the dryer burned holes in it and I followed care instructions (Tumble Drying), and I only washed it maybe 10 times these year.",2
B08BG86NB7,"Bought this as a gift for my son and he couldn't be happier. It's warm, sturdy and good looking. There's a reason you see a lot of tradesman wearing these; they just don't wear out under hard use. I don't get why ""for working out"" is part of the overall rating star section as I can't imagine why anyone would work out in any jacket like this. Buy it; you'll love it and it will last longer than any other garment you own.",5
B08BG86NB7,"awesome jacket. very warm, very well constructed. I would by over and over again. I usually wear a medium in coats and large in shirts. I purchased a medium and it fits perfect. I can still wear a flannel or long sleve shirt underneath. If you want to wear a hoodie underneath, I might size up. but this is really warm, not need tfor the extra layers.",5
B08BG86NB7,I'm in Oklahoma and it's not super cold yet. Got down to 22 and windy. It also rained one day in the 30s. I'm from California. This is my first winter like this. I'm just wearing this with a regular tshirt underneath and I'm warm as could be. Took the kids trick r treating in the 30s and i was just fine. Cool thing is the pockets are lined and insulated too. So i didn't need to wear gloves. I don't like gloves. Held up in the rain too. Didn't get wet. This is the jacket to get,5
B08BG86NB7,"If you want a warm jacket get this one, you will not regret it. Would have gave it 10 stars",5
B08BG86NB7,"This fits like a glove, except for the hood. The hood is way too large and the fabric is so stiff your vision will be impaired if you have to look up unless you have it tied up. I wear a hat instead.The inside zipper pocket is the perfect size for a CCP holder. My Sig is a perfect fit with no imprinting.",5
B08BG86NB7,"Purchased Large US as a gift for my son who was looking for a winter casual jacket. He tells me it fits a little big, likely due to the relaxed fit, but he is happy that he has room for layers underneath. The back is a little longer, zipper runs smooth, the hood is fully sized. Overall, it's what he was looking for.",5
B08BG86NB7,This jacket is rugged and made well. Once again Carhartt quality stands up to the test. Nice warm and roomy jacket that will stand up to the elements. As you know the material is a little stiff at first and slowly breaks in and then you have a very comfortable jacket that will last a long time Woul recommend to anyone looking for a well made jacket.,5
B08BG86NB7,"Bought this again, only because I lost weight and was swimming in the original.Super durable, warm and comfortable - fits really well as well - and I get a ton of compliments by women!  Probably one of my favorite all time jackets.",5
B08BG86NB7,Purchased this Carhartt Jacket for my husband.He loves it!!!,4
B08BG86NB7,"I thought it was going to be more insulated. I got the olive green and the picture looks like its more insulated that it is. Which is my own fault for not looking harder i guess.. Not saying it won't keep you warm. With layers I'm positive it will. I just thought it looked as insulated as my company coat. But unlike my company coat, this coat fits amazingly. Im 6'6 220. Got the XLT. Boy does it fit good! I'm definitely still keeping it! Looks good and with a few layers I'm not worried about getting cold. But if you want the thick boy, you need to get the next step up in the ""warm rating"" by Carhartt. This one is 2nd from the top.",4
B08BG86NB7,"This jacket is amazing however the zipper is hands down the most un-usable zipper I've ever seen. I'm not sure what cost savings this was for Carhartt because it sure isn't a YKK zipper but the zip is not even usable. Forget any one-hand smooth operation. It's going to be 2-hands on the zipper with enough force to break a pencil in 1/2 to get the zipper moving. I used some zipper lubricant and ran it for a few mins to see if that broke it in any more. I love this jacket and once it's zipped up, it's perfect for me but be aware this is a huge deal breaker for many.Carhartt - what the heck. Fix this!!!",3
B08BG86NB7,"My husband  is 6'1 200lbs and normally doesn't have enough room to really move his shoulders. This looked like it would work especially for allowing him to move.  I got him this jacket for christmas. He absolutely loves it.  No issues with zipper.  Fits true to size, I got him XL.",5
B08BG86NB7,Coat is all good but the shipping left me waiting for nothing and then at the last minute changes till the next day..Thanks alot Amazon smh!!!,4
B08BG86NB7,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband but I end up stealing it every now and then! The jacket is comfortable but more importantly WARM! It looks great on him as well!,5
B08BG86NB7,This way a winter purchase during the coldest time of year. Was pleasantly surprised at the newer style of this jacket. The fit was great and I was advised by an Amazon alert to buy the xl and not the large size. To nice to wear to work !Buy now .,5
B08BG86NB7,"I like the fit, I am 5'9"" and 220, stalky, and the Large fits perfect.  There is plenty of length to cover your belt area and the dropdown rear provides more length in the back.  Very comfy in cold weather, and I have enough room to layer.  Can't go wrong with this jacket.  Well made, high quality, will last. For what you get in a Carhartt jacket, well worth the money.",5
B08BG86NB7,"excelente, como todas las prendas de esta marca",5
B07VGQTMYD,"Really happy with my purchase. This is the perfect jacket for slightly cold weather to wear on it's own or over a hoodie. Very simple design but it looks great with pretty much anything, also love the zipper pockets. I'm 5'8"" male, 160 lbs and the medium fits perfectly. Might consider getting this in another color because I like it that much.",5
B07VGQTMYD,Fits perfectly light weight jacket perfect for my area with the weather conditions not really cold.,4
B07VGQTMYD,"I just received my jacket and I'm quite impressed with the look and feel.  I'm 6'2"" and 242lb and thought this jacket would not fit me.  I was wrong, it's an excellent jacket for the price and the sleeves are great for my long arms. The front and side zippers are smooth and there's an pocket in the inside of the jacket to the left side, and there a zippered pocket on the left sleeve with two sleeves to slide pens into.  It hard to find good fitting stylish jackets for a big guy like me but I'm happy I made this purchase.  The packaging it came in could be more presentable but other than that I'm loving this jacket.",5
B07VGQTMYD,"I had this jacket in my cart for a while now and finally decided to purchase it when it went on sale for $32. I am extremely pleased with my choice; the jacket is stylish and fits well and i'm 6"" and weigh 195lbs and bought a large.  I've been wearing it over a thick hoodie, which has kept me warm in Southeast Pennsylvania. It effectively blocks the wind, although I haven't yet tested its waterproof features yet.  The heavy-duty zippers and polished silver accents contrast nicely with the black color I selected. If you've been hesitating to buy, I highly recommend making this stylish addition to your wardrobe.",5
B07VGQTMYD,"All the jackets I own are XXL, ordered XXL and it fit like a Large and there is no larger option. Otherwise it is a nice looking and well made jacket, just wish it fit. I had a feeling this would be the case, usually is when I order clothing online, but thought it was worth a shot, had to return.",3
B07VGQTMYD,I just tried it on and it fits perfectly and it looks really good on me I think I'll be ordering another one in a different color I highly recommend it,5
B07VGQTMYD,Fits great. Lightweight and comfortable. If you get the pink and black you can be Danny and Sandy from Grease.,4
B07VGQTMYD,Needed a light jacket and this was a great choice. Fits great and the arms are a pretty good length too. I got long arms. Nice material inside and out. Other reviews provided issues with the zipper which is why I gave 4 stars. The zipper does feel a bit flimsy and can be stiff when zipping up but so far works fine. Looking forward to wearing this as much as possible before the temps get too low.,4
B07VGQTMYD,Alot of those all the way the zip,4
B07VGQTMYD,Buena calidad,4
B07VGQTMYD,Lightweight and waterproof. It does keep me warm. Very happy with purchase. I have received many compliments when I am wearing my new jackets.,5
B07VGQTMYD,My son loves this jacket,4
B07VGQTMYD,The quality of this jacket is spectacular.... great buy,5
B07VGQTMYD,Perfect size and warm too,5
B07VGQTMYD,"I really like the look and feel, however the sleeves were a bit short for me. I am a tall man with longer than average arms though so I should've just gotten the next size up.",4
B07VGQTMYD,"Very nice jacket. Comfortable and exactly what I needed, a lighter jacket that is stylish and versatile.",5
B07VGQTMYD,True to size. Quality material.,5
B07VGQTMYD,Good quality,5
B07VGQTMYD,Lindo,5
B07VGQTMYD,Jacket is comfortable. Very good for the money.,4
B07VGQTMYD,"For the cost, the jacket is decent.  The only thing I would change is this jacket having a liner to keep you warmer and better job at cutting down the breeze.",4
B07VGQTMYD,Love the jacket fits perfect!,5
B07VGQTMYD,"Great product, nice color, true size.",5
B07VGQTMYD,What a great jacket. Pairs well with so many looks.  Great zippers and fabric. Very sporty. Definitely a keeper.,5
B07VGQTMYD,"husband loved it , nice medium, weight . stylish.",5
B07VGQTMYD,"good quality, keeps my torso warm even at roughly 28 degree weather, sleeves not so much but not too bad",4
B07VGQTMYD,The size was prefect. Like the color,5
B07VGQTMYD,This jacket saved my life from the weather here in Jersey,5
B07VGQTMYD,It seemed very nice,4
B07VGQTMYD,I ordered this jacket just intime for the winter cold front and it was amazing to wear I love it,5
B07VGQTMYD,Great fit and great feel. Hangs on me just right. A thin coat and easy to move in. I almost forget I have it on.,5
B07VGQTMYD,"I really like the style of this Jacket but the material is kind of thin, it does not really retain warmth or block the cold. It can definitely be worn during 70ish degrees weather. Overall great jacket for style though.",4
B07VGQTMYD,This is a true to size light jacket that looks stylish yet simple and feels great to wear. My wife has complemented me on how good it looks as well. Even my young twenties boys think this jacket looks great on. Happy with my purchase.,5
B07VGQTMYD,"My friend traveled to colder places, and it suited just right. Warm, soft, good looking, great color.",5
B07VGQTMYD,"The jacket is very nice, the only exception is that it is thin and very light. But didn't really know that until I received it. But I still like it.",4
B07VGQTMYD,comfortable to wear and water proof,4
B07VGQTMYD,Bought for my boyfriend and he loves it.  It is light weight and goes well with everything.,5
B07VGQTMYD,I liked this wind breaker as it is light and not insulated. Perfect for me when I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and don't want to get too warm.,4
B07VGQTMYD,Awesome style.,5
B07VGQTMYD,Affordable,4
B07VGQTMYD,This is a well made jacket and the quality workmanship is very evident. The jacket shell is a smooth material that is quite to wear and wrinkle resistant. Great pocket layout and decent quality knit cuffs and collar. Comfortable to wear and keeps the wind off. Non insulated so a jacket for milder weather . Fit is a touch on the large side. I can wear a medium in most jackets but a small in this brand fits me perfectly. Not a rain jacket but will turn back light rain and probably would do very well with a coat of waterproofing spray. I would recommend and buy again.,5
B07VGQTMYD,Great amount of compliments when I wore this jacket!!!!,5
B07VGQTMYD,"Great for layering, easy to clean.",4
B07VGQTMYD,"Tried one of these bomber jackets and the quality and price was right. I was so impressed with them I purchased five differently colored ones and until the weather turns too cold to wear something warmer I have been enjoying them all. Has plenty of pockets, good lining, real metal large sipper and cleans off nicely.",5
B07VGQTMYD,The quality is very good and the price is reasonable.,5
B07VGQTMYD,Jacket its perfect true to size and cheap for the product.nice buy,5
B07VGQTMYD,Wears great so far!,4
B07VGQTMYD,Good construction decent quality not warm,4
B07VGQTMYD,Bought this for my 25 year-old son who is very picky about clothing and he absolutely loves us. He gets  so many compliments when he wears it..,5
B07VGQTMYD,The jacket is good quality fit well and is comfortable. It is a little lighter than I want but still serviceable.,4
B07VGQTMYD,Muy buena la calidad/precio,5
B07VGQTMYD,Very nice stylish jacket,5
B07VGQTMYD,The fit is spot on. The quality has been great and plenty of little pockets for storing things.,5
B07VGQTMYD,Very well made jacket at low price. Fabric is not too thick but it's okay. Will buy more colors.,5
B07VGQTMYD,"The fit, finish, styling, and mycomfort are top notch",5
B07VGQTMYD,The terminations and the feel are very good. Excellent value. I wish that in their measurements chart they would include the belly. I have a big one and can barely zip it close. That is the reason for the 4 stars. If you don't have a big belly you'll love it!,4
B07VGQTMYD,Excellent quality- fits great!! Great color!!,5
B07VGQTMYD,Great material great product for the money looks snazzy as well,5
B07VGQTMYD,This is a beautiful made bomber jacket. It fits perfectly.,5
B07VGQTMYD,Perfect fit decent price.,4
B07VGQTMYD,The jacket is comfortable and looks good. It's not an accurate copy of a flight jacket as it has snaps as opposed to zipper closures.I'm keeping it because it serves my purpose in South  Florida.,3
B07VGQTMYD,good jacket for cool weather,5
B07VGQTMYD,Material is very thin not thick like displayed.,3
B07VGQTMYD,"First time I tried, it was so perfect, the size, the materials it's so comfortable.. Thank you",5
B07VGQTMYD,Great for cool weather or windy weather. Looks great on,5
B07VGQTMYD,Muy bueno,5
B07VGQTMYD,It was little too big for small size,3
B07VGQTMYD,Look Nice,4
B07VGQTMYD,"Looks better than I thought, perfect fit",5
B07VGQTMYD,This is a nice little jacket for those just cool evening. Light weight and looks nice.,4
B07VGQTMYD,This bomber is light weight and washer machine friendly. The quality is nice and my husband brought his size and still had arm room. It pairs well with a lot of his shirts for a nice added touch!,5
B07VGQTMYD,My husband enjoy this item,5
B07VGQTMYD,"Very lightweight casual wear jacket.Fits well, has ""flat"" color green as opposed to a more shiny traditional green.",4
B07VGQTMYD,Quality,5
B07VGQTMYD,Light weight and fit nice,5
B07VGQTMYD,JACKET FIT JUST RIGHT.  I LIKE THE MATERIAL.,5
B07VGQTMYD,For the price the quality was just OK.  Had a baggy weird fit towards the waistline and zippers felt like they wouldn't last so I had to return.,3
B07VGQTMYD,Like everything,5
B07VGQTMYD,Nice jacket very stylish and great for Fall and early spring.,5
B07VGQTMYD,"Although it is a very nice jacket,  I am returning it because my son wants it in black rather than blue.",5
B07VGQTMYD,"It's just as pictured. They're definitely windbreaker material. I'm 5'9"", 175lbs and the medium fits great.",5
B077SVB38N,Super comfortable fit great seem to last a long time. I replace when they get holes which is more than a year.,5
B077SVB38N,The underwear in made well. The only complaint from my husband was that there was no pee hole. That was a big deal for him,4
B077SVB38N,Nothing at all....Nothing at all....Nothing at all.,5
B077SVB38N,"I am very impressed with these underwear. The fit is perfect, and many times during the day, I don't feel as though I am wearing underwear. The cotton fabric is very soft, making wearing them a pleasure.  Plus, the support is right where I need it. I will repurchase them.",5
B077SVB38N,was able to post pone laundry day,4
B077SVB38N,"Comfortable it stretches, has good room nice thick material and durable. Good purchase for the value.",4
B077SVB38N,"I have tried a few different brands and can't seem to beat these as far as comfort, fit and elasticity. They just fit right and do not fall apart as fast as other pairs I have owned. Never heard of the company before I bought them, but I search for them by name now.",5
B077SVB38N,Not great quality.,1
B077SVB38N,"Large is good for me. They don't ride up and I honestly don't feel them. I wish they had a 100% cotton version (work), but these are nice.",5
B077SVB38N,Comfortable but quality suffers. Washed twice and already have holes. Spend a few more dollars and get a quality product.,2
B077SVB38N,"So I've worn Mediums all my life. I've always been a thin person. I'm 5'9 and my resting weight would be anywhere from 145-165lbs. I've gained weight, so now I'm at 185lbs and in need of new boxer briefs and I needed to go up a size. I had to take them off the other night in bed and just free balled it. I haven't went through a ton of comments, but I haven't seen anyone have the same complaints as me. So maybe it's just me. They fit like some of my smaller mediums that I have to toss out. They felt like a small pair of bicycle shorts. Really tight. I went back to a few bigger mediums till I find a new pair. I really don't think I'm in need if an XL. My waist is only 34-35"". Maybe they shrunk after I washed them? Thought I put it on warm water only. I mean, I am a guy. Wouldn't be the first time I've shrunk something new. Otherwise they appear to be pretty nice. So I can't knock them for what was probably my error, so I won't dock a star for that. I'm still trying to find boxer briefs that are stylish and have a taller elastic waist band. This band folds over from my new gut. Always been a bean pole. Graduated at 135lbs. Now my doc says I need to lose 10-20 anyway.Edit: I filtered out the reviews for people who ordered larges and I found a ton of reviews that state the same problem. They did shrink. I'm use to boxers similar to basketball shorts type material and not 95% cotton. Other reviews stated they fit a bit on the small side and the elastic band folded on them like me.I'll keep them. I stepped on the scale & it said I weighed 186. I guess my @ss has been getting a little big.",3
B077SVB38N,These are great a fit like a glove.,5
B077SVB38N,"Very Good, Very Comfortable, Great Price.... Thank You",5
B077SVB38N,"Comfortable, Breathable, and Well-ConstructedRating: 4.5/5 starsI recently purchased the 5Mayi Men's Underwear Boxer Briefs in size L, and I'm impressed with the overall quality and performance. As someone who values comfort and technical details, I was pleased to find that these boxer briefs deliver on both fronts.Fabric:The 100% cotton fabric is soft, breathable, and absorbent. The weave is tight enough to provide support without feeling restrictive. I appreciated the natural temperature regulation, keeping me cool during intense activities and warm during relaxation.Design and Construction:The regular long length provides ample coverage without bunching or riding up. The four-way stretch ensures a full range of motion, making these ideal for daily wear, exercise, or outdoor activities. The flatlock seams reduce chafing, and the sturdy stitching ensures durability.Features:- Moisture-wicking properties keep you dry and comfortable- Anti-odor technology reduces bacterial growth- Tagless design eliminates irritationSizing:The size L fit true to my expectations, with a comfortable waistband and snug, supportive legs.Overall, I'm satisfied with the 5Mayi Men's Underwear Boxer Briefs. While not revolutionary, they offer a solid balance of comfort, performance, and value. If you're seeking reliable, everyday underwear with a focus on breathability and support, these are definitely worth considering.Pros:- Comfortable, breathable fabric- Well-constructed with attention to detail- Moisture-wicking and anti-odor features- AffordableCons:- Not particularly innovative or stylish- Limited color optionsRecommendation:If you prioritize comfort, performance, and value, these boxer briefs are a great choice. However, if you're seeking fashionable or high-end underwear, you might want to explore alternative options.",5

B077SVB38N,Quality product,5
B077SVB38N,"Concuerda la talla , buen material",5
B077SVB38N,"I've been ordering these for around five years. I have tried lots of brands recommended by review sources, like The New York Times and Men's Health. Why I keep buying these is that they are the only ones I have that don't ride up--even compared to pairs that cost over twice as much. My problem is that they don't last. Between six months to a year, they start reliably developing holes. So if you are fine buying a new set every six months, these are great!",4
B077SVB38N,Very good boxers,5
B077SVB38N,Theses fit great they don't rise up and have a very comfortable feel,5
B077SVB38N,Buen producto,5
B077SVB38N,"Nice value for the price. Looks nice, feels nice",4
B077SVB38N,Gift for my son. He loves these. They are his favorites. They seem to be made of good material and good workmanship.,5
B077SVB38N,This met my every expectation.,5
B077SVB38N,They are very good and have gone through the washer and dryers many time while holding up very good. I would recommend them .  I will be purchase another pack soon.,4
B077SVB38N,These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn you know you're covered but it feels as though you have nothing on underneath order second set of five right away,5
B077SVB38N,"Probably didn't read the description too well, but anyway, found out that the waist is like a mile long. Not a fan of my underwear showing, but maybe some people like that.Everything else was fine",4
B077SVB38N,"Fit, and peehole",5
B077SVB38N,good fit and comfort,5
B077SVB38N,A good fitting and comfortable product.,5
B077SVB38N,"The boxers have great elasticity, durability, and value for money. Highly recommend!",5
B077SVB38N,I lost some weight but needed to replace my larger size underwear with a larger waistband and a smaller size. Needed a cotton soft well fitting pair.Reasonably priced. They fit the bill.,5
B077SVB38N,"Se ven de buena calidad, la talla corresponde y se recibieron en el tiempo esperando.",5
B077SVB38N,Fit well and keep their elasticity for a long time.,5
B077SVB38N,No better feel than wearing new briefs after a shower.  This product is fantastic!,5
B077SVB38N,Amazing quality and comfort,5
B077SVB38N,ok,5
B077SVB38N,These fit really well.  Great material and very comfortable,5
B077SVB38N,Bien,4
B077SVB38N,"Size was as described, looks like the material are durable great value for the money.",5
B077SVB38N,"These underwear are very comfortable but the crotch area needs more reinforcement for the well and doubt men, they wear out to fast.",3

B077SVB38N,Great underwear soft material and they fits perfectly no rolling down I love them plan on buying more as soon as I need some,5

B077SVB38N,Good product. Satisfied.,4
B077SVB38N,"Nice looking stretchy unders! Seem to be good quality, no issues with seams or blemishes anywhere. I'm happy with them and would buy again. The material; lite but heavy enough. Hold them up to a light source and give them a little stretch and you'll see light thru them, but chase your girlfriend around the apartment in your skivies and you're not gonna fall out. They stay where they should, and so do you.",5
B077SVB38N,"There are three (and really only three) parameters by which to rate an online clothes purchase:1) Are they the right size?2) Are they comfortable?3) Do they look as expected?The answer to all of these is a resounding 'yes.'I guess question 4 would also inform the review: Are they durable? The answer to this question is unknown at this point, but I can say they certainly seem to be a high quality and markedly durable purchase.No complaints or even trifling reservations about these.",5
B077SVB38N,"Nice underwear, I love the colored piping with the black elastic and garment body! These look like good quality and run a bit small compared to Hanes but they fit well.",5
B077SVB38N,they feel great.,5
B077SVB38N,the only thing that bothers me about them is there sewn together between the legs and in all the other ones that I have worn like that is were they go bad first the seems tares apart I hope these dont,4
B077SVB38N,"These are the second package of undies by this brand I ordered for my hubby, 5'6"" and about 190..wears 36 waist jeans. These fit him very snug but with a tiny bit of breathing room in legs, and they don't ride up on him at all, after wearing nearing nearly 22 hours they are just as snug and tight hugging to all his parts as when he first puts them on. So no saggy butt unlike any Wal-Mart variety undies he ever tried. Even after a month of use and a few washes. As for the front of the undies they hug tight and tend to smush his junk to him more than make a pouch or cup...hubby is more a grower than shower but the undies will stretch and be comfortable to him no matter his rate of hard or softness and then go back tightly hugging him when fully soft again, but no side hug to the balls; the front flaps overlap a lot so no risk of accidental spilling out and can make it hard to fish out through it, but hubby never uses the flaps on any undies finding it easier to just pull jeans n undies down in front to use restroom..so he finds these very comfortable to wear all day. The colors tend to be more muted tones than the pictures on Amazon, like the bright orange pair came as more a dark mustard color and the jungle green color came as more a army green color. And the Hawaiian pair came so dark blue they almost look black and white at a fast glance. The greys tend to be the exact same shades in person, so its just the undies with color that tend to be darker more muted tones. Hubby works in a warehouse with dock doors open in all weather and he likes these undies since he doesn't feel hot n muggy in them on hot n muggy days and he still feels comfortablely warm on chilly days. So these are the best all around pair of undies he has ever owned, now if they did pounch in front and hug balls on sides instead of just mashing flat then they would be completely perfect (but then any pouching would be hard to be perfect for all sizes).",5
B077SVB38N,"These may be the most comfortable underwear I have ever purchased. Absolutely great fit and no waist roll. Bought two packages, one of a solid color and mixed color. BEST EVER!",5
B077SVB38N,too long and flimsy,3
B077SVB38N,Good,4
B077SVB38N,Very comfortable but the support area wears thin quick. After about 4 months you start getting holes and rips. It is like the support area disintegrates. Consider throw away under needed in emergency,3
B077SVB38N,"Nice product, comfortable fit and true to size.",5
B077SVB38N,Hubby loves them.,5
B077SVB38N,Great fit. Will never buy anothe name brand,5
B077SVB38N,"This seemed like a quality product and I will keep them, but I wouldn't buy them again.  I didn't like the fit.  They seem to ride too high at the waist for me.  I like the Kirkland Signature Men's Boxer briefs better.",4
B077SVB38N,These are very nice.Unfortunately I have to return mine for the next size up as they definitely need to update their sizing chart.I wear a size 30 waist and I was concerned they would be lose on me. But they we're so tight they excusingly flared my sciatica badly.I'd highly recommend ordering a size up.I gave 3 Stars because of the inconvenience of having to return them otherwise they would have received 5 Stars,3
B077SVB38N,Comfortable but smaller than the size labeled so you need to order a larger size or expect it to be very tight.,3
B077SVB38N,"These are very nice, I should have bought more! Great fit and comfort.",5
B077SVB38N,"First and foremost, I bought these Boxer briefs looking for a bargain, because men's underwear is outrageously priced. However, you get what you pay for.Out of the bag, these Boxer briefs were Great!! They were comfortable, breathable, flexible and fit well around the waist, but of course still lacked in the support area. Still fit great nonetheless.However, after having owned many a pair of these Boxer briefs, they tend deteriorate faster than most. After about 6-8 months of regular use, I found small holes in the support area and by days end would have larger holes and found myself with chafed inner thighs.I would recommend these if your in a bind, but if your looking for longevity and looking to get your monies worth, I would NOT RECOMMEND these. Invest in a better quality product that'll last you a few years.",3
B077SVB38N,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Washed and hanged 6 times. Washed and dried also with no different feel. Still the same. Still great. MAKE more great colors. Not black or dark navy. Make more earth based colors. Brown, taupe, beige, tan. Greens, olive. Sage. Mint. Thank you ^_^",5
B077SVB38N,Tha underwear is everything they says is and more fis great and it arrived as scheduled.,5

B077SVB38N,My son loved the men underwear.,5
B077SVB38N,well made,4
B077SVB38N,Very flexible and comfortable for him. Will buy again,4
B077SVB38N,"They seem to be made well but they are very long....when I sit wearing athletic shorts I see the colored hems sticking out from underneath.  I would return them but I had to try one on, so I'm out of luck I guess",3
B077SVB38N,liked how they fit and feel,4
B077SVB38N,just what i wanted thank u,4
B077SVB38N,"These are soft and seem well made, but for some reason they are very high-waisted. They either wear with a massive amount of space in the crotch, or pulled up over your belly to a height that only Carl from Sling Blade could appreciate. I didn't see ""big and tall"" on the packaging, and that's not what I ordered, but it almost seems like that's what I got. Also, if you have a bit of a gut (like most of us older guys do), then you will constantly deal with the rolling waistband. Unless you are Carl from Sling Blade.",3
B06VZ3RCYS,"Bought this red shirt for my husband to wear as part of his Halloween costume, but due to the color being red, he didn't wear it again aside from Halloween. I do like how durable it is and that it comes in a variety of colors. I will probably buy him the same shirt again, just in a different color so he can wear it out or at home. He really liked that it is soft, durable, comfortable, and that it fit him like a glove. It washes well and is made of good quality fabric.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Purchase for my son during the summer. It was breathable and comfortable. Fit him really nice: not too tight; not too loose. It gave him a classic yet modern style. Washed it several times and the material is durable. Overall it is a great value.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"It fits and looks good. Since the collar is a bit soft and floppy, I recommend using adhesive collar tabs.",4
B06VZ3RCYS,Very comfortable & durable work shirts. Great value for the price. True to size.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"The fabric is soft and comfortable, and keeps me cool and dry, even on warmer days. It fits perfectly and looks great, whether I'm dressing it up for work or keeping it casual on the weekends. I will purchase it again!",5
B06VZ3RCYS,"Comfortable and great fit! Feels quality and has survived many washes and dries without significant shrinkage.  I will be purchasing again, great item for the very affordable price!",5
B06VZ3RCYS,PROS- cheapCONS- it feels cheap & the material is too thin- it has a chemical smell- L size is too largeReturning it now.,3
B06VZ3RCYS,The shirt looks good as a dress shirt. Comfortable and right size. Good material. Held up after washing.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"Material is a good weight, color is sharp, perfect right out of dryer, needs no ironing. Very long, tho. My 5'5"" husband had a lot of material to tuck in his jeans! Size Large. But it looks good and he likes it. Would buy more if different colors were available in his size.",5

It was heavy enough to make you feel like you were getting something of great quality, yet still lightweight enough so that you can move around without sweating. For the price this was a great value. I will be buying more of this product.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,"So I circuited a small business logo on these for a friend. They took the vinyl logo great. They are not super thick or heavy, but they are not too light either. So good medium weight shirt. I washed it before putting the logos on and they held their shape just fine. I would say, for the price, these are really pretty good quality.",4
B06VZ3RCYS,"For the quality, color options, and comfort, you cannot beat this buy. I was skeptical about buying this shirt simply because of the price (ie You get what you pay for). I was so impressed with the quality of this shirt, I bought 5 more (in different colors of course). I would definitely buy this again should the need ever arise.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,This is a nice looking shirt. It is well-made and fits perfectly.  Color is bright and attractive.  Arrived quickly.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Fits great and it's comfortable. It's true to size and doesn't shrink when washed.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"The material is lightweight, sizes run big, and not the best as I would expect from HANES. I wouldn't order it again.",4
B06VZ3RCYS,Thanks. It fits well,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Good fit and comfortable material,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Aa described.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,fit as described,5

B06VZ3RCYS,"Very comfortable.  They are mens shirts , so they are a little big. Will be getting more of these shirts.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Bought this for spouse that is now a 3XL dude thanks to the junk food industry. I know right? Found this very nice shirt and fits him well. Good quality and makes him look nice and not a slob. The price was right at the time. I need to get more. Always get a back up when you find a nice shirt.,5

B06VZ3RCYS,They fir great true to size,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Arrived on time and as expected.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Title says it all. They seem to be very comfortable but they're also very lightweight. Normally I like lightweight materials but for some reason I don't think the collars are going to last very long on these,4
B06VZ3RCYS,Fits perfectly on my husband and good material,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Comfortable fit size is good easy to wash,5

B06VZ3RCYS,Muy buena calidad,5
B06VZ3RCYS,This is a very good shirt.  It fits very well and keeps me warm.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Bought this as a gift for my father. He walks wears these type of shirts but always wears the same colors. It feels very high quality and soft. I also got one in blue and soon will be getting on in red!,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Todo muy bien.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Not frumpy like every polo I've tried. Never looked good in a polo and avoided them. This one looks good and is comfortable.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,que es una tela fresca,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Fue para regalar,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"Fit great, comfortable, easy to care for.  I have several.  Highly Recommend",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Good,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"I just bought and washed these. They seem to be Hanes good quality. They fit fine. They're for work, so I'm delighted with the price!",5
B06VZ3RCYS,"Excellent work shirt . Not too thick but not too thin. Fits good, washes well and the price is decent.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,I bought a few different colors. The only complaint is the deep red color. It was a bright red. It looks nothing like the photo.,4
B06VZ3RCYS,Good quality and nice fit.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,This time Hanes surprised me with the quality of the shirt. I bought it twice.,4
B06VZ3RCYS,Perfect fitting,4
B06VZ3RCYS,"I bought this for my granddaughter as a back up work shirt to keep at my house for when she visits and has to go to work right after so I wanted an inexpensive one but.... It's well made, true to size and I'd order it again if I need a polo. I bought her a small.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Nice shirt just found a better one,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Colors r a bit too big to my opinion. But I am satisfied with the purchased.,4

B06VZ3RCYS,Very comfortable. Wrinkle free.,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"Looks nice, can casual or formal. Very good for your money",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Good fit,4
B06VZ3RCYS,"They fit me a little loose, but it is OK. Incredibly good for the price. Another good black polo to change into.",4
B06VZ3RCYS,This shirt is okay. I ordered the burgundy and it is a solid red. I would not have ordered it if I new it was red. The fabric is thin and shows every little thing Which is strange for a mens pullover. My partner does not love it compared to other shirts I  have purchased him.,3
B06VZ3RCYS,Comfortable and doesn't shrink.  Matches product description to a tee,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"I liked this product, but I didn't realize that it really is true to size, soe I bought a bigger size than I needed.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Bit itchy and rough for me,3
B06VZ3RCYS,"Basic polo shirt but feels light, has some stretch and is breathable. Solid shirt in my opinion",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Very good fabric and finish,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"This shirt fits very well. It's a bit tapered, so it's not as boxy as other polo shirts.  Use the size charts, not what you think would fit you. Vanity sizing is no longer limited to women's fashions. I used to wear XL, but yesterday's XL is now today's L.",5
B06VZ3RCYS,Awesome work shirtCannot find these anywhere else,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Nice size and good  quality,5
B06VZ3RCYS,Good look and fit,5
B06VZ3RCYS,"Good quality, not too thin not too thick. I would still wear an undershirt. My bf states that it's breathable and cute but you can see his chest through it a little bit",4
B06VZ3RCYS,I wear 4 Xl shirts.  This one was good but not perfect.  I just liked others better.  It was good enough for a fat guy to not be disappointed.,4
B06VZ3RCYS,Worth while purchase,5
B08WWT83PH,Could not wear them.and I have a small leg . and no name on the socks.china junk .$$$ down the drain.good for nothing,1
B08WWT83PH,I am very unhappy with these socks they are too tight and seek like plastic,1
B08WWT83PH,Socks will cut off your blood flow!,1
B08WWT83PH,These socks are horrible. The quality of the fabric is ok but they are way too tight. They cut off your circulation.,1
B08WWT83PH,Good value but painfully tight on me at the top. Gave to 108 lb wife and also too tight for her. Will make good dust cloths.,1
B08WWT83PH,"DO NOT BUY THIS SET OF SOCKS THEY DONT FIT RIGHT, PLUS THEY ARE UNCONFORTABLE TO WEAR, MAKES YOUR FEET SWEAT BECAUSE THEY ARE NYLON MATERIAL....",1
B08WWT83PH,"Overall the quality is acceptable with one exception -- for my lower leg size, at least. The elastic cuff makes for an overly tight fit. It's uncomfortable for me. It will depend on your leg dimensions. I'll be donating them.",1
B08WWT83PH,"This bag came with a big hole torn in the side (despite the bag easily opens on one end) and a pair of socks was stuffed in (not folded like the other pairs) and had obviously been worn. They were dirty on the bottom and there was lots of hair stuck to them - SUPER GROSS! This made me inspect all the pairs in the bag very closely and they were not nice quality. Many have weird rough spots, others already have snags, and some have small dark stains on them. What is this? A refurbed bag of socks? If the only issue had been just one worn pair I would have considered keeping them but the gross pair plus poor quality? No thanks! Returning!",1
B08WWT83PH,"If you are a bigger build or have any amount of calf muscle then these are simply too tight and dig in.  Will be returning.  I don't, but those who swell up below the knee in summer or due to medical conditions would certainly have trouble.",1
B08WWT83PH,"Tight and thin, these are not performance socks at all.",1
B08WWT83PH,The quality has gone way down on these socks. They used to be my husband's go to socks. Not any more. They're just made cheaply and size runs small. I won't buy this brand again.,1
B08WWT83PH,Why would anyone make or sell socks out of 100% polyester?  Socks should always be mainly cotton material.  Feet started to get wet and gross feeling inside the shoes and the stocks made it worse by not absorbing any moisture.,1
B08WWT83PH,defintely a different sock as compared to 2022. much more stretchy. leaves sock prints ion legs for hours afterward. not a deal breaker but prefer old fabric.,3
B08WWT83PH,"Overall I like these, they are comfortable.  They fall between a typical tube sock and a dress sock in thickness so they wear out quicker than I expected.",3
B08WWT83PH,Very small and tight on the ankles. I am size 11.5 and had to give to my son. My main concern however was the fact they are polyester and make my feet sweat and smell!,2
B08WWT83PH,Runs extremely small for mens socks. I wear mens shoe 11. And these barely fit. I gave them to my grandson.,2
B08WWT83PH,Cheap quality not classic Gildan not sure If they changed their product or is this is a knock off,2
B08WWT83PH,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                              Los mejores calcetines largos que he probado, son suaves, hacen como un acolchamiento , no se sienten en exceso gruesos y se secan rapido. Lo unico es que pueden sentirse un poco ajustados pero creo que podria ir a gustos y bien construidos.",4
B08WWT83PH,One of the brand new socks had a hole in it.,3
B08WWT83PH,"It's apparent to me that either this seller, or Gildan, does not know the difference between 'Crew' and 'Knee High', because these socks are definitely not the crew socks that I ordered.AND, they have that infamous toe lump issue, that a lot of socks have, where the tip of the toes gets all jumbled up and wraps around your toes and feels uncomfortable. E for Effort, but these are NOT worth the money, and it costs more in time, effort and gas to return them. Maybe I'll find some granny somewhere to knit me a sweater out of them.",3
B08WWT83PH,These socks started off a little bit smaller then I expected but seem to stretch out enough to fit all right. With each subsequent washing these socks have gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. In addition to being smaller they constrict my foot particularly pulling my toes on comfortably. I have included a picture of my previous socks after many months of washing alongside a sock from this set after about 2 months worth of wearing 12 pairs of socks...,2
B08WWT83PH,Baby likes em and comfy,4
B08WWT83PH,"I got these for hot-weather uniform work.  They are way smaller than any other socks I've owned.  The package says ""size 6-12"" but if you wear 11 or 12 you'll def want to go a size up.  These things are stretched to the limit.  I don't even have overly wide feet or anything.  They have double walls around the bottoms up to the ankle for reinforcement I guess, but with the two layers and how small they are they feel like compression socks.  Not sure how long they're going to last at max stretch for a whole work shift, but they do feel cooler for the most part.  They were definitely hard to put on, and if you have damp feet after a shower they're probably not going to go on unless you size up.",2
B08WWT83PH,"For the price, these are good work socks",4
B08WWT83PH,"I got these for my husband, best pair of socks he has had in a long time he said. Soft, and comfortable.",5
B08WWT83PH,"Almost constricting, hard to get on and I sweat more than normal in these",2
B08WWT83PH,"I bought them for the quantity and low price.They fix TOO tight.I keep them, because I don't have time to return.I will give them to a charity.",3
B08WWT83PH,"These socks don't work all that great for me. They're plenty thin, which then causes my shoes to be slightly loose. And they're too smooth or something - my shoes slip more on my feet than with other socks. I'll pass on these socks next time.",3
B08WWT83PH,"Putting the socks on for the first time felt bizarre. The socks felt like nylon when I put them off fresh from the package. In fact every pair I've put on feels off. I'm glad I bought the socks because the price was right and for the need but I'm not going to be buying this product in the future, I don't like the way they feel when in put them on.",3
B08WWT83PH,"socks are good i like them, would buy again.",5
B08WWT83PH,fit tight,4
B08WWT83PH,"Thin enough that they can dissipate heat easily. Wraps snuggly up my calves. As someone who refuses to walk barefoot and always wears socks, these are a daily must have for me.",5
B08WWT83PH,Fits perfectly,5
B08WWT83PH,Very nice,5
B08WWT83PH,I brought these for my hubby but he didn't like them. So I try them on and I his wife fell in love with these.. I would recommend these for anytime to wear. But especially in the summer time. They keep your feet warm and comfy and they don't over heat your feet in the summer.,5
B08WWT83PH,"I enjoyed these socks because they will breath well, but not too much. They seem to be made of durable polyester. GILDAN socks provide good stretch for fitment and have platinum cushioning for your toes.  Would recommend.",5
B08WWT83PH,My boyfriend uses these for work but they are pretty thin and hold sweat.,3
B08WWT83PH,This is possibly the best purchase i made. It's way better than buying it for 20 dollars more. They are comfortable and I use these every single day,5
B08WWT83PH,These have too much elastic and stretch way out of shape pretty quickly. Will not purchase again.,3
B08WWT83PH,These are not sized properly. Probably would fit a size 6. Made very small.,3
B08WWT83PH,"I bought a 12 pack and when arrived, the bag was open and only had 11 pairs.",3
B08WWT83PH,Okay,4
B08WWT83PH,"Worst ""cushion"" socks I've ever tried on. Good number of socks for the price if you don't care about cushion but if you need the cushion, better to spend more money...",3
B08WWT83PH,very tight.  collect all the dust from the floor,3
B08WWT83PH,Not what Gildan used to be.  These were so flimsy and lacked durability .  We wound up donating them.,2
B08WWT83PH,Very thin,3
B08WWT83PH,"A bit thin, does not feel like its going to last very long. Strings are already coming off before wear.",2
B08WWT83PH,Very nice socks,5
B08WWT83PH,Good deal. Well made.,5
B08WWT83PH,Nice fit would have been nicer if they were a little thicker,4
B08WWT83PH,These were thinner than I expected. My husband did not like them.,2
B08WWT83PH,Was a great addition,5
B08WWT83PH,Great value for the money and a comfortable fit.,4
B08WWT83PH,Not very thick especially on top.  Not bad for the price,3
B08WWT83PH,Great valueGreat price,5
B08WWT83PH,My husband is very picky about his socks. He said that the socks were comfortable and fit well.,5
B08WWT83PH,Good quality and comfort,5
B08WWT83PH,"not happy with the length, but will try them.",2
B08WWT83PH,"These are soft, but already pilling after 2 washes.  I'll be interested to see how long the last.",4
B08WWT83PH,They are tight and thin. They stretch enough to fit but they will wear very quickly in the stitching. Close to a slack sock or dress sock with no real added cushioning. They are fine for what they are and the price.,4
B08WWT83PH,They were just what my son needed for band,5
B08WWT83PH,Good for the price but thinner material then expected,4
B08WWT83PH,I love the comfort and lightweight feel of these socks. Since these were so comfortable I am ordering the black socks now.,5
B08WWT83PH,Thickness is good in this socks.  Size also comfortable . No problem in wearing & using,4
B08WWT83PH,WAY TOO SMALL FOR A SIZE 12,1
B08WWT83PH,Everything Great!,5
B08WWT83PH,I rec. this the very next day my Grandson love's them.,5
B08WWT83PH,"Socks way too tight from the ankles up, not comfortable to walk in.",2
B08WWT83PH,These socks were very thin and the material is slippery.,2
B08WWT83PH,not comfortable,3
B08WWT83PH,Fit comfy,5
B08WWT83PH,My son is going to camp and there are some clothing requirements. Black socks being one of them. These arrived quickly and are good quality. I would purchase again.,5
B08WWT83PH,I wasted my $$$. They are like compression socks.,2
B08WWT83PH,Quality is poor compared to the old ones.  Would not recommend.,1
B08WWT83PH,Sent these back when I discovered that Hanes socks at Walmart were cheaper and much better quality.,1
B08WWT83PH,Comfortable.,4
B08WWT83PH,BEST SOCKS IVE PURCHASED,5
B08WWT83PH,Already have a sock with a hole on it.,2
B08WWT83PH,"They are tight and higher than most crew socks, they suck",1
B08WWT83PH,"Perfect basic white socks. Very durable. So many other brands end up with holes in them. These hold up and are extremely durable, thick, and comfortable.",5
B08WWT83PH,Great value,5
B003CK2HC4,"One of the most important things for me was choosing suspenders that used a grip system that wasn't going to damage my expensive snowpants.  Thus, I didn't want metal clips or those with pointy alligator style grips which could potentially make holes in my pants.  Well these suspenders use a plastic cam-style grip that holds on to the fabric tightly and they functioned beautifully.  I just spent a week snowboarding in Colorado and am very happy to report that these suspenders stayed put on my pants, did not cause any damage to my pants, and most importantly, kept my pants up no matter what I was doing.  Glad I bought them.  The easily adjustable wide 1.5 inch straps also didn't cause any pain on my shoulders.",5
B003CK2HC4,Plastic buckles seem to hold. One the pin fell out. I was able to find it and hook it back up and hasnt fallen out since. The cross piece in the back keeps dropping to my back and the suspenders fall off my shoulders.,4
B003CK2HC4,"UPDATE: OCT 2022Still find these chums to have the best easy to use clips that have never damaged any type of clothing.THE ONLY ISSUE, as meant to be, these are tough workhorse suspenders for the ruff game of hockey.The plastic clips are amazing but I think along with the string stretchy suspenders themselves, it is awkward to wear under street/office clothing (of you care what people think)Wish company would take what must be a patened clip, and creat a line of regular suspenders with the teck in f the clips.Never seen clasps like this. All hard thick plastic claps, BUT WORK PHENOMENALLY at holding and not coming loose or damaging the fabric compared to any traditional clasps.Not for street or close ware, but for sport... And I am guessing if in working/building etc business, it may be just as good",5
B003CK2HC4,Product works.  One of the clips is not as well manufactured as the others.  During longer hikes it slips off.  you should inspect the clips to make sure they are all identical.  I did not figure this out until after the return period expired.,3
B003CK2HC4,"the clips are super duty,  material streches with you,",5
B003CK2HC4,"I had to readjust the X adjuster in the back almost every hour.The heavy-duty clips are very tiny and can accidentally come off easily.I am keeping it for the season, but going to look for a different set for the next year.",2
B003CK2HC4,"I purchased these hiking suspenders after reviewing at least a dozen other options online and have been quite pleased with them.  They are durable and should last for years.  Also, the clips hold clothing quite securely (without tearing), important for more challenging hikes.  The black elastic fabric used for the straps appears very sturdy, and the black plastic clips also seem designed to last for years.  One minor issue:  the straps cross in back, and the ""cross-over"" point can slip downward -- meaning that the straps can tend to slip off one's shoulders at times (which can be irritating on challenging hikes or climbs when hands are otherwise occupied).  If this product included a way to clip or clamp the cross-over point in place, the suspenders would be at no risk of slippage.  Not a big deal, though.  I should be able to improvise something easily if it becomes a problem.In fact, I like these suspenders so much that I've now purchased two pairs:  the first pair (which I'd purchased for myself) arrived just before Christmas, when my parents were visiting.  My father (who also likes to hike) quickly said ""are these for me?""  And he ended up keeping them!  So I ordered another pair for myself in early January.My only cautionary comment involves the cost.  The suspenders were $17.99, which is not bad.  But the total jumped to $26.69 with shipping and tax.  (In particular, $6.95 for shipping seems fairly high for such a small and light item.)  Still not a huge amount of money, but spending nearly $30 makes for a fairly expensive pair of suspenders.  It would have been nice to find them in a local hiking store and avoided the shipping time and cost. (I checked Campmor, among others, without success.)  Alternatively, if I'd been able to purchase them directly from Amazon (rather than from LuggagePoint via Amazon), I could have placed an order that would have included free shipping, which is always a good option.On balance, though, I like this product a great deal.  I received it quickly and it looks as if it will last many years.",4
B003CK2HC4,"Hey fellow Big Guys, you know who you are.: 6+ ft.tall? 200+ lbs? Strong as an ox, and twice as smart?I got a newsflash for you: THEY'RE ADJUSTABLE!!! And plenty long enough!Before buying I read multiple Big Guy eviews that said they're not long enough, but being a big guy myself I ordered them anyway. When they arrived and I first put them on, I had the same reaction. Wow, they're barely long enough, and I couldn't see any adjustments. Well guess what? They're on the back! And when adjusted to maximum length, they hang down to the crotch of my 6' frame.Yes it's an interesting design and I'm not sure that I love that particular feature, which is why I gave 4 stars. The upside is that they look nicer from the front, the downside is that you can't adjust them while wearing them without taking the straps off your shoulders, dropping them down, and...well, you get the picture. That might be a bit embarassing on the ski slopes. I use them now on my bike pants and they work very, very well. The clamps (also a unique design) hold very well even when I adjust the straps to be quite tight and hunch over during my rides. The overall construction is very sturdy yet because the clamps have no teeth, they won't ruin your pants.these suspenders are a real gem! I would recommend then to anyone, but especially to my brother Oxen. Oh, and one last thing, going forward, I'm abandoning the ""Ox"" nickname to go with ""Stallion"".Hey Big Guys out there: don't you agree?",4
B003CK2HC4,"After one use we were sliding the cross holder and it broke. Bummer, seemed other wise sturdy.UPDATE: Chums customer service was highly communicable and immediately sent a replacement. Careful with the plastic piece in the middle but otherwise sturdy.",4
B003CK2HC4,Really liked these for the first few uses but the plastic clip broke after 5 uses.,2
B003CK2HC4,"Bought these to hold my ski pants up. Can't believe I waited so long. Much more comfortable that squeezing my waist with a belt for anything active. Easily removed from my shoulders when not needed, like when getting dinner in the lodge or using the restroom.Total game changer on my leg mobility when not having to pull up my pants up slightly when I'm halfway down a trail, while trying not to drop my poles all while still skiing.",5
B003CK2HC4,"The quality is good. But, I am short and it does not adjust properly for a comfortable fit.I would recommend it for taller people (5ft 4in +). Take into consideration that it is elastic and stretches far more than you may think. Height is a big factor for this to fit properly. I would give more stars but trying to return for a refund is a nightmare. I want a label to return but the only options are return it to a Partnered Store, pay UPS for pick up, or try to find a location that I can easily get to for drop off. I don't mind paying for a return but to have no option for a return label via USPS - that's the nightmare. Guess I'm stuck with something I can't use.",4
B003CK2HC4,"I have a pair of Marmot Precip pants that is loose and it kept riding down. Since the pants have  double full length side zippers and no belt loops, suspenders were the obvious solution. I have some old suspenders that have metal clips with teeth but they would have penetrated my new Precip pants and I worried that it would create a tear.With a quick search on Amazon, I saw the Chums design with plastic clips and decided to try it and it worked. It grips very tight with no penetration or ripping even on the thin Precip material. The only issue is that I'm on the shorter side (5'5"") and the length adjustment buckle ended up on my shoulders and would have been uncomfortable with a backpack. I had a tailor shortened the suspender and it worked perfect! It would be nice if it could be designed in such a way to avoid this issue (had to take away a star for that).",4
B003CK2HC4,"First off, I'm 6'4"" tall with an athletic build and these fit me just fine.  Bought these to hold up my ski pants when on the slopes or snowshoeing.  These would have gotten five stars but one of the latches in the back seems to unlatch itself randomly.  ONLY ONE OF THEM!  Not sure if there is anything I can do to make the one stop unlatching itself.  Tried many attempts of readjusting it and latching it in another place but it kept coming undone.  Then you have to take off the gloves, lift up the ski jacket and put it back on or just live with the feeling of your pants falling.  I ended up putting a small piece of electrical tape around the clasp once they were locking in place.  This prevented articles of clothing from unlatching it.  Not a big deal to me anyways.",4
B003CK2HC4,3rd season using these suspenders. I have found that I need to attach them over the belt loops (double layer of fabric) in order for them to stay on. When only placed on a single layer of fabric they would sometimes come off. I usually have them on loosely as not to pull up on the pants but rather just hold them in place. They work greta when employing this method so no major complaints. Would have been 5 star if I could attache them anywhere.,4
B003CK2HC4,"Bought these for skiing.  As other reviews note: they do pop off, but *only* if you put them on the wrong way!  I initially put them on with the levers facing out because I assumed they'd poke me if they were in.  If you wear them this way, then they pop off at the slightest provocation.The next day, I turned them around, so that the levers were up against my body, and they stayed securely closed, even on challenging mogul runs requiring a lot of movement.  I never noticed them at all: very comfortable even wearing them facing in.One star off because if the triangle in the back moves, then it's hard to get it back into place without help (or taking them off, or being some sort of yoga master).  That's only happened once, so maybe taking off a whole star for that is too harsh, but there you go.",4
B003CK2HC4,My wife bought these for Christmas and I've worn them daily since. It's too early for a comprehensive review but I have a couple of comments.The plastic cam action devices used to hold the suspenders to the pants are a big improvement over the traditional metal clips. Those metal clips are stamped out on a press and (at least in my experience) always leave fairly sharp edges that can catch on shirts shirts or skin the knuckle when tucking in the shirt.The cross piece in the back is adjustable. That's good and bad. Good because it allows greater fit adjustment however the plastic adjustment cross piece slides quite a bit and needs to be re-adjusted several times a day. I'm going to have my sweetie put in a stick or two to lock it in place.We'll see how they wear.,4
B003CK2HC4,Good product used them for my ski pants.  One of the clips broke.  Thought the will hold up better.,3
B003CK2HC4,"Does what it supposed to do, way better than belt for snowboarding. Definitely an improvement in managing warmth and not getting any snow in your pants",5
B003CK2HC4,Use these to hold up my ski pants (hard shell).  Work okay but occasionally the buckles come undone when I sit on the chairlift. Kind of a pain to get them re-clipped when  you're out on the hill in the cold with tons of layers on.  Might try to improve the clips with some tape.,3
B003CK2HC4,"This set of suspenders are my new favorite after a few modifications.  I removed the plastic guide in the back as it would not stay in place but slide down, I remedied this by sewing the suspender cross point in the back to the exact location I liked.  The front slide adjusters do not hold their position and also slide a bit slack after wearing them, I plan on also sewing these into my favorite position.  The clips that attached the suspenders to your pants work excellent.",4
B003CK2HC4,They are long enough for tall people.  Easy to adjust for shorter persons.,5
B003CK2HC4,"Prob going to return.  All the clasps do not lock into place.  It's VERY EASY to unclasp!  So, if you're in the right type of seat (happened to me on a couch and then on barstool) where the clasp lever can catch the back as you get up, it may unclasp.  AND it's NOT EASY to re-clasp without undressing.  But when they're working, I do like them.  Still not sure if I'm returning - see how much they pop off - but worn them twice and popped off twice.  May be it's operator error and I'll get better at getting up out of seats?",3
B003CK2HC4,"If you don't turn them inside out, the clips will pop open every time you bump one of them into something - like bumping the clip on a chair when you sit down. If you do wear them inside out with the clips opening toward your body, these are great! The difference is dramatic. Regardless of how you wear them, they hold very well and are comfortable.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"Soooo comfortable, true to size, great material, low cost, nice looking, and the convenience of three pockets. I have these in all the colors offered.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,A little thinner than traditional sweatpants but feel great and an excellent fit .I wear a 32-33 and bought the mediumThey fit perfect!,4
B0BN4VKZJD,"I have a pair of Perry Ellis joggers that are lined and have zipper closures instead of cuffed ankles but as I am getting older I am shrinking so they have become too long and dangerous for the treadmill and Stair Master.  I still like to wear them around the house because they a comfortably lined.  I then bought a pair of Old Navy Active joggers with the cuffed ankle which I need for the treadmill and Stair Master.  However, I don't like the side pockets, the cuffed ankles are way too tight and I didn't realize that there's no back pocket which I need. So I bought these mostly cotton joggers which have nice side pockets AND a badly needed rear back pocket. The cotton is very comfortable and the  cuffed ankles comfortable.  i am very pleased with them and the price is nicely competitive espcecailly with a pack pocket which most are missing.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"I purchased 2 pair to use these as indoor pajama-lounge wear. They are cotton and sized truly, light weight (not heavy like sweats), durable, and are priced reasonably. They launder well, and are one of the best purchases of clothing I've made. Would definitely buy again.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"very comfortable, absolutely love the material but the crotch depth was insanely long, everytime I ride my bike the crotch part gets stuck on bike seat it is sometimes dangerous and very inconvenient. I measured it to be about 15 inch crotch depth",3
B0BN4VKZJD,Not too loose or too tight. Pretty soft and comfy to lounge in,4
B0BN4VKZJD,"Very comfortable, light weight. My husband loves to wear them to workout in or lounge around the house. They are pretty flattering on him, too.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"After experiencing the soft performance of a fully cotton item, I'm never going back to mixed fabric. It keeps the body temperature regulated and washes well without shrinkage.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"These fit very well. Cloth seems nice enough - it's not too heavy, not too thin. When I bought them I half-expected I would be returning them, but no. A good buy, and at a good price!",4
B0BN4VKZJD,My son uses these to sleep in along with a t shirt.  They was and dry nice and haven't fallen apart yet.  yay!,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"The medium size fits more like a small. If you typically wear a medium, consider ordering a large.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,The joggers are excellent ima just cut the tag on the back as it has chaffed me around the tailbone thank you goodnight,4
B0BN4VKZJD,These pants are comfortable and great for lounging at home can't beat the price,4
B0BN4VKZJD,"I ordered these thinking they would be fleece sweat pants like a sweatshirt.  My mistake as they clearly state that they are jersey  (t-shirt) material.  They are lovely pants with nice pockets 2 side pockets and a rear pocket!!!I order men's sweats because the women's sweats never have good pockets.  If these Sweats were fleece they would have been perfect,  but once again that's my mistake for not paying attention to / fully understanding the description.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,Great value and the closest to 100% cotton I could find. Color is as described. Durable enough for my husband to work in cold weather when he cannot wear thermals anymore.,5
B0BN4VKZJD,These are great for grey sweatpants season.  Not too thick and soft.  Good for cool weather but not cold.  The inseam may be 30in from the bottom of the crotch but these are like drop crotch pants.  So for me there's a lot of material that pools at my ankles.  Last con is they stretch out a lot.  Otherwise I like them.,4
B0BN4VKZJD,My husband loves these!,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Fits great  and feels comfortable really good quality I would recommend it,5
B0BN4VKZJD,good basic soft cotton pants,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Good fit, comfortable, and well priced. Two side, and 1 rear pocket.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,Great Option!,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Hubby likes them,5
B0BN4VKZJD,These sweets are so comfortable  and they fit just right. The material their made of make them look very stylish.  I only wish that the cuff at the bottom fit a little tighter,4
B0BN4VKZJD,ok,5
B0BN4VKZJD,These are more like a T-shirt material just a little thicker they are super comfortable,4
B0BN4VKZJD,The fit is perfect!! They are extremely comfortable!! Not thick like other sweater/joggers. Highly recommend!,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Nice soft light weight and good fit,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Cannot really give too much of a review on these as I bought them for a gift but they seem very well made look comfortable will give an update after Christmas,4
B0BN4VKZJD,Just what I was looking for. Great fit and not to heavy  or baggy. Bought 3 pair,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Me gusta,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Been trying to stay away from synthetic gym clothes. These are deifniitely a great buy. I ended up ordering another two pairs.From the description it seems that the heather colors are not 100% cotton, so keep that in mind.I would highly recommend.** The stitching can undone on one of them by the leg, but my tailor fixed it for me at no cost. I still think it's a good deal for the cost.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,They fit very well due to being super stretchy. I even wore them outside to shovel snow in 30 degree weather. Love these pants!,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Exactly what I ordered. Perfect weight and fit.,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Fit perfectly. Soft and warm.,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Good fit, little long in the legs",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"The fabric was not as thin and soft as I had hoped. I bought these because as a tall woman I wanted 100% cotton jammie pants that don't ride up my legs at night. They did shrink a little during first wash. I am usually a size 18/20, inseam 32"", so I bought XL. They are plenty large, but not as soft and stretchy as I had hoped.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"Purchased these for myself a size larger than I normally would to leave plenty of room for multiple washing and drying. Half a dozen washes/drying later, they still cover my ankles.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,I bought it as Christmas gift for my husband and he likes it,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Great fit very comfortable,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Really wear well, and fit well.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"The pockets could be bigger .However, overall comfortable stretches when you need it in all the right places !",5
B0BN4VKZJD,These do not fit like normal sweatpants.  They are really oversized in my opinion.  They are not really that soft.,3
B0BN4VKZJD,These pants were thinner material than I expected but are still a good buy. My husband says they're very comfortable and they launder very nicely.  The fit is according to size and I would reorder. They are a good value.,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"I love these pants. The fit is perfect, they are comfortable and stylish. I like these much better than the standard baggy jersey sweat pants I usually buy. I immediately bought multiple more pairs in different colors.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,Fit true to size,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Fits nice,5
B0BN4VKZJD,My husband likes them,5
B0BN4VKZJD,I got these for my husband last Christmas and he loves them. He wears them constantly and they don't show any signs of wear and tear. He says they're super soft and breathable and he can walk our dogs in them and be comfortable or just lounge around the house.,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"OK product, but the ""sweatpants"" are very thin and don't provide much warmth.  Old school sweatpants were made of thick cotton and loose.  Not these.  No elastic cuffing at the bottom of the leg, so I hope you aren't short.  I'll keep these, but it wasn't what I expected.",3
B0BN4VKZJD,Thin material. Also too small/tight however I am female so that is not surprisjng.,3
B0BN4VKZJD,"Why they call these joggers, sweatpants is a mystery. They are very lightweight cotton pants. I guess you could jog in them or use them as pajamas but they are not sweatpants. Do not have elastic at the bottom just straight cut.",3
B0BN4VKZJD,My husband likes the feel of these and that they are not restrictive...he just had 2 major surgeries on his hip.  however; even though they are joggers they are too long..they should have a short and  regular length to choose from....but he will wear them a lot while doing PT..,4
B0BN4VKZJD,"They are on the thin side, but I really like them. Fit good , the length is good.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Awesome price, so soft, true to size, a lot of give, there is pockets",5
B0BN4VKZJD,Like it. Super comfy and pockets are deep enough to hold a 6 inche phone. Dont know if durable enough but will find out,5
B0BN4VKZJD,These joggers were of very thin material.  I would not recommend them if you need warmth.  I would go with  those made with the 60%+ cotton and 40%+ polyester. Returned for credit.,3
B0BN4VKZJD,"Should not be advertised as sweatpants. These are thin, jersey joggers, with fabric equivalent to a relatively  lightweight T-shirt. They are nice for what they are.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,Great sweats. I haven't been able to find sweats with pockets a 30in insem and elastic arount the ankles. These have all that and for $12 how can you go wrong?,5
B0BN4VKZJD,The fit,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Wonderful material, like Hanes Beefy-T shirts. Cut is incredibly bad for joggers: Super high waist, excessively long inseam in smaller sizes. For me, calg was too tight, everything else was loose. Sloopy sewing that makes me question durability.",3
B0BN4VKZJD,These jogging pants are thin with side pockets. I can honestly say these are so nice that I bought 3 more colors of them.,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"I like it but it's more for warmer months, for temperatures under 40 it's like putting a napkin on.",3
B0BN4VKZJD,"Basic, they do the job.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,Good simple inexpensive sweatpants,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Cool, light, good feel and fit.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Quality is OK, nothing special, very lightweight, almost weightless. I wear a size small and they fit perfectly, a little loose. If you prefer a more tight-fitting, then these are not for you. Also, I am 6.1 (185cm) tall and these pants are quite long.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"bought 2 hanes cotton joggers light grey and navy blue. size medium. both joggers fit me well, but the navy ones weren't tapered bottoms. they had the stiching of tapered bottoms on a straight leg. sewing kid was probably tired.",3
B0BN4VKZJD,"I ordered a 2x purposely to allow for shrinkage. My husband needs room in the waist which usually the legs will be too long, and they were. Being 100% cotton I shrunk them to the perfect length.Comfy fabric and not a winter weight. Sewn nicely, good shape after a go/round in a hot dryer. Worth the $10 but army green only.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"I wrote a bad review of joggers /sweatpants by Fruit of the Loom, bought around the same time as these, and these are by far the much better option for only a few dollars more. Better fit, waistband, drawstring, material, feel, sense of durability, pockets. I'll prob order more, give away the Fruit of the Loom pairs (bought two, ugh) to someone much larger around the waist.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"Very thin, tight and lightweight.",3
B0BN4VKZJD,"Very soft and comfortable. Perfect fit for an XL guy. More comfy than the Champion cotton pants that I've worn for over a decade (Also mfg'd by Hanesbrands).A couple quibbles though. The elastic at the waist and pant leg is too loose.  Needs to be a bit snugger to prevent pant legs from riding up all the time and you have to tie the waistline drawstring a bit too tight to keep pants from sliding down. In doing so its also awkward to relieve yourself in the bathroom without having to untie the draw string.Over all though 4 stars, not bad!.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"Very light feel to them. I agree with the other reviews saying they feel like pajamas. That's pretty much spot on. I like my jogger pants to feel a bit more baggy to them but it seems like the style is no where to be found. I'm not really big on having pants taper at the calf. I like a relaxed semi baggy fit. They're nice to wear around the house, but not for the gym or other activities.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"It's either the next day mail or two days. I think it's the former. Its 100% cotton fabric feels so nice. Better than some other 100% cotton fabric, I guess, due to how they weave them or the quality of cotton. Feels so nice, my skin loves it. And great fitting, too. 5 stars!",5
B0BN4VKZJD,Very thin. And runs small. But feels like they will be comfortable so no complaints,4
B0BN4VKZJD,"I forgot to pack a pair of joggers on a recent trip to Colorado. My host suggested I try Amazon for fast delivery and vast choices.I ordered an inexpensive set of 2 thinking I would leave them behind after my departure.I'm glad to report that I still have them because they are comfortable, well made,survived 2 washes without problem and best of all at an unbeatable price.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Good sweats, but run a little small",4
B0BN4VKZJD,My brother loved it,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Exactly as described, quick delivery. Thanks!",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"The fit around the waist is perfect. Only problem is that I find them too be a little too baggy in the crouched and leg area. Also they could be just a bit shorter, just a bit too long for me.",4
B0BN4VKZJD,"My husband loves these. We tried one and just ordered more.- Lightweight. Great for summer on days you don't want shorts. Similar to T-shirt material.- Washed well. Machine wash cold, dried on low caused no shrinkage.- Nice enough to wear out for errands, etc., but soft and comfortable for around the house. They hang nicely and don't look sloppy. Nice wide waistband.- The jogger leg openings don't ride up on his legs when sitting down.- He wears a 33 or 34 inch inseam in regular pants or jeans. Inseam in the product listing says 30 inches. Yet somehow these are still plenty long. Actually a good length. I don't get it, but it works.- True to size overall. 5'9"" and 170 pounds, large fits perfectly.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Warm, soft,  and not thick.I wanted somthing light to wear around the house in the winter (Michigan ;P),  my knees would get cold with Shorts on.These are so comortable!!!",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Comfortable and instead of the single loop tying thing, it has the two separate strings. I prefer that.",5
B0BN4VKZJD,My main beef about jogging or sweat pants is the legs too long for my 29 inch inseam. Not these. They fit really well. Also well made. I also like the cotton versus all synthetics that grab your socks when you put them on. These slide easily. 5 stars for me,5
B0BN4VKZJD,Love them! Good lightweight material. Feel very comfortable and deep pockets. Sizing is excellent!,5
B0BN4VKZJD,"Great price and very comparable to Champion sweats. The Champion was not quite twice as much, and they are both a thinner summer material. They fit great and look good",5
B0BN4VKZJD,"bargain of the year, soft but sturdy. great fit & drape. the perfect loungers for any season. bought all 3 colors, bc, why not",5
B0BN4VKZJD,I use these for long walks and still great for just lounging around! Love the elastic at the ankle and the waist. Pockets are deep enough to hold small items and the back pocket is very convenient!,5
B014IVTLXS,"Very thick and very soft socks and extremely comfortable.  Kept my feet warm all day long in below freezing weather slogging in mud, snow, and farm manure.  Normally, waterproof farm boots are rubber and cause your feet to sweat and then to get very,very cold.  Not with these socks!  And, the socks breathe and don't overheat your feet if you wear inside where it is warm.  Nicest socks I have had!",5
B014IVTLXS,"I am a woman with size 10 feet! So I can't be bothered fighting with tiny, little, tight woman's socks that do not fit comfortably and make my feet freeze...these men's wool socks on the other hand are unbelievably spacious, warm, cozy and soft, not scratchy at all! Also they stay up all day without choking your leg! I highly recommend these wool socks they will not disappoint!",5
B014IVTLXS,"Loved the socks, they kept my feet warm in some pretty cold places. One issue with the manufacturer: each pair has a plastic tie connecting both socks to a label. Removing it is impossible without damaging the socks - before you even get a chance to wear them. I wish they used a thread or some other solution instead.",5
B014IVTLXS,"These are very cushy and warm socks, though the cuffs could be more stretchy. They feel solid in quality.",4
B014IVTLXS,"They are very soft, thick and warm. The assorted colors are great!",5
B014IVTLXS,"I was looking for wool socks for everyday use at the office and home. Specifically to keep my feet warm indoors. And that could be worn with business dress shoes or sneakers during the Arctic Midwest winters. I was a bit skeptical about the quality for the price. I bought based on customer reviews and I am very glad I did. This is actually the second set I've purchased. I started with the multi-color and then ordered this shade 5 pack about 48 hours later. I noticed a difference nearly immediately after putting on the first pair. They were exactly what I needed and was looking to buy.These have worked much better for me than some much higher priced wool socks I purchased from a specialty store. The cost of a 5 pack here is about what I paid for a single pair. I don't think the other brand lacked quality but were purposed for outdoor use in heavy cold weather. More of my bad than the manufacturer's .Until - and if ever - temps warm up in the Midwest I will continue to wear these every day. I am extremely satisfied with the function. However in terms of feel and comfort they exceed expectations as well. The socks are comfy; not blanket like but feel good to put on. They are thick enough so that I don't feel coolness on the sides or top of the socks. The material is equal in depth over the entirety of the socks. But not so thick that it causes difficulty when putting on shoes.The final test was to see how they stood up after being washed. There are visual instructions on the sturdy bag these come in as to how to wash them. Cold water is the main thing. We followed those and the socks emerged beautifully. In appearance and feel, I have not seen any difference. That's after only 1 wash, mind you. So take that with a grain of salt.Honestly I knew nothing about wool socks whatsoever before finally getting fed up enough with my seasonal cold feet. I had no bias towards a certain brand or shop. If you may be in that same situation, these are worth taking the leap.",5
B014IVTLXS,"I bought these socks because I live in NE PA, ""up the mountain"". We have rough winters, average temps in the teens.I wear a size 10 shoe, and most socks tend to be on the larger size for me, coming up to my knee.These are not like most socks. They sit to the bottom of my calf. They are ok for warmth, but not great. If you plan on wearing these outside for an extended period of time, whether for work, or camping/hunting, they will NOT keep your feet warm.But what is most irritating is they drop. When I pull off my pants, the socks come off with the pants, very annoying.I can say I'll never buy these again.",3
B014IVTLXS,They were better than Smartwools at a fraction of the cost.,5
B014IVTLXS,Not as thick as I would have liked but not bad for the price . Fast shipping,4
B014IVTLXS,"I have purchased all sorts of wool socks for hiking and camping, most of them at 2-3x the price of these. Yet, these are warmer and more comfy than any others I have owned. I absolutely love these.",5
B014IVTLXS,My feet are burning!!!,5
B014IVTLXS,"These socks feel great on my feet, added extra cushion wearing work boots. The socks feel and look well made. I would recommend these socks to anyone looking for a comfortable thick, yet breathable sock.",5
B014IVTLXS,These are Christmas suggestions from my son in-law who is very particular and would not have suggested them if they did not deliver.  I am sure he will love them.,4
B014IVTLXS,"They're ok. Not super thick, whatever that means, which is fine. They're plenty warm with boots, but my set has a couple different lengths. Whatever.",4
B014IVTLXS,Excelente calidad.,5
B014IVTLXS,"Bought 2 packs for my family christmas gifts, they feel very soft, good quality and for sure delicate so to avoid any damage and squize the most out of the lifespan, they should be washed accoringly with instructions, also had the womens socks and both versions of the product are great... cant wait for cold season to use them",5
B014IVTLXS,I am on my feet at least 10 hours a day. These socks are thick! Just what I needed. I am purchasing another 5 pair. I have looked SO LONG for good socks. These are GREAT for my workbooks and feet.,5
B014IVTLXS,Good value for the price,5
B014IVTLXS,"I love these socks. Thick, cushy and warm. Very happy with them.",5
B014IVTLXS,Getting ready for winterHe loves them,5
B014IVTLXS,"Hey. If you want thick and soft and warm - that's it.* Warning! They might be too thick. I could not use most of my shoes. They are really thick. But they are not the old-fashion style kind of thick. They are not hand-knitted. So when I say thick I mean it for a sock that looks like a cotton one.* Are these real wool? Yes and no. I am always doing a burning test for my wool purchases. And they burn like wool, maybe 80-90% wool. And a little of some kind of polyester didn't detect any spandex.* Are these itchy? To my great surprise no. I am quite sensitive to wool socks. I only can wear a very low wool blend, or cashmere, or super-soft alpaca. I don't know why, but this wool has been very nice to me. I hope it doesn't mean the manufacturer found a trick to fake a burn test.PS. some reviews say these are medium thick. I really don't understand what they are talking about (aside from hand-knitted socks). If they are right - and I was just unlucky my whole life - I'd like to see them posting an example of a thick sock. Just this time had 3 brands in one order. All 3 say ""thick wool socks"", one claimed to be ""knitted"". Two of them were not even 50% wool (heavy blend) and both were thinner than these.This review got too long for an under $20 product, if you get to this point.... here is a bonus to you :) * An old piece of advice my grandpa gave me. If you're getting sick put on those itchy wool socks when you go to sleep. They will keep you warm and will irritate your skin activating the immune system. And it's true: I would wake up with my feet red like tomatoes.",5
B014IVTLXS,"It's great when you're out all day long, really soft and comfortable. And the pricing is a lot better than most place I go to.",5
B014IVTLXS,"I bought these socks for my boyfriend for snowy winter days, but I came back and bought a pack for myself too because they are so incredibly warm and comfy. They really are SUPER thick, so they cannot be worn with certain shoes/boots because they are so thick; so that is definitely something you need to keep in mind. They have gone through the washer and dryer a ton over the winter and seem to be holding up very well. I do not dry them on high heat though, I try to remember to dry them at a lower setting because I would hate to fry them.",5
B014IVTLXS,I like these,5
B014IVTLXS,I bought these because I needed something thick for work.  The first purchase lasted 4 years.  I just purchased 2 more.  They're great.,5
B014IVTLXS,These socks are very soft and comfortable.Great value for the price.I would recommend these 100 percent,5
B014IVTLXS,Nice and thick and fit fairly well for size 13 x-wide,5
B014IVTLXS,I have gotten these socks before so I know they keep my feet nice and toasty. Only left 4/5 stars because the color Grey is much darker than pictured in ad.,4
B014IVTLXS,"I have very cold feet, and these socks are very good for me.  I like the variety of the colors.",5
B014IVTLXS,Soft and thick.,5
B014IVTLXS,"These hold up well but as you wash them some of the sock become smaller. Seem to fit ok but if you hold them up together, one sock will be slimmer and shorter. Odd",4
B014IVTLXS,"I don't think any of my socks don't get holes eventually.These are nice and thick though. If you're looking for an actually thick sock, these are the ones",4
B014IVTLXS,Returned,3
B014IVTLXS,"The description states 5% spandex and ""The Wool Socks is blend of premium cashmere, merino wool and cotton"".The label states:  35% wool, 36% polyester, 24% cotton, 5% spandex.  I have attached a scan of the label.Made in China.The socks fit good so far.  They are not overly thick, but do have a nice cushiony feel to them.  I have not laundered them yet since I just received them so I do not know how they will hold up to a washing.  There are special laundering symbols but I doubt I will follow those closely, maybe air dry them since they seem to not want a spin in the dryer.  I wash clothes like a person does, not like a corporate laboratory does.  Whites and colors separate.  These socks are colors, right? :).The tops of the socks do not bind my legs so that is a plus.  They are very soft feeling.  The colors are great, not too flashy but not too dull.Edit:  Still a bit perturbed about the false description about the material making the socks.  It has been noted by numerous reviewers that the description is misleading.  These are not just a wool/cotton blend.  There is more synthetic material than what the description on Amazon states.  It should be changed to reflect the actual makeup of the sock material.After a few months of wearing these socks I have found them to be too short.  They do not go up far enough on the calf so it feels uncomfortable.  The heel pocket is not right so the socks tend to slide down the foot.  They also seem to pill a lot.  They do retain the color and softness, though.",3
B014IVTLXS,Nice thick socks that fit a long and narrow foot. Excellent socks for working outside. Thank you!,5
B014IVTLXS,"The socks are as advertised, they are thick enough, and good price for wool blend, and the only thing I would change would be to have them a little taller.",4
B014IVTLXS,"These socks fit and feel nice, but if you live where it gets really cold, then these might not be the winter socks you're looking for. I've used thermal socks during the winter for years and they're much warmer on really cold days.",4
B014IVTLXS,"Thick and Warm , took off a star because they fall down and snake down my feet inside my boots during  long hikes. Some colors are thicker than others.",4
B014IVTLXS,Satisfecho,5
B014IVTLXS,"After wearing these socks for a few weeks, I need to be honest and update my initial review.First Comfort: These socks really feel comfortable and you feel pampered wearing them at home especially when it's cold. I have one shoe which has more room in it than my foot size, but wearing these socks with the shoes makes me feel full in them, and really great for work too.Initially I thought the quality was suspect, but I was wrong. Note that these are wool socks so it's normal to see some fur on in after using them. I've used and washed, used and washed a few times and do not see any wear and tear or holes in them. I strongly recommend these socks",5
B014IVTLXS,"Got these because I needed some new wool socks. They are a little shorter than I anticipated, but makes up for it with the comfort and warmth.",4
B014IVTLXS,"I've been wearing my current wool blend socks (which I've been happy with) so much this winter that they are wearing out and no longer available on Amazon. So after going through the many options available on Amazon, I was hoping that these socks would be at least as good as those. I'm very happy to find they are better. These go up my ankle/cafe about 2 inches higher than my others, which is a big plus; and they are every bit as soft and warm as the socks I've been wearing around the house these long cold winter months. All 5 pairs of socks arrived in perfect condition and appear to be well made.",5
B014IVTLXS,I have bought these four times now and never disappointed,4
B014IVTLXS,"Good for the price, but a little thin. Fitting is good",4
B014IVTLXS,First order great. Just the right blend of wool and synthetics to cushion  and launder well.  The size was good.  Then  I placed a second order just weeks later . What I recieved is shorter in length heel to toe and heel to ankle.  Like  a womens size.  This second order is going back. I will treasure the first order and continue my quest elsewhere.,4
B014IVTLXS,"These are exactly what I was looking for, a hiking sock with cushioning.  I ordered 5 different brands that each advertised themselves as 'hiking' socks. Every other one I ordered had some cushioning, but the others were more for comfort while walking or just around the office or something.  These keep my feet comfortable after hours on the trail. They are what I would call 'midweight', not 'expedition weight' - not for extreme winter conditions but great for backpacking. They are sized right too: I wear a men's 9.5 (US) and the small is fitted perfectly.  Oh, and the colors are great!!  Each package comes with a nifty sticker too.",4
B014IVTLXS,These socks are great at regulating temperature and are very breathable. The colors are also very nice. I wear them outside and inside. They are also soft and not itchy at all~ Definitely one of the best socks I have ever had. Just buy them.,5
B014IVTLXS,"I'm an older person with poor circulation in a cold state.  And these did what I needed.  Stopped that painful cold sensation in my feet throughout the day.  I used them all winter and did not wear holes in any of them, so this pack of 5 may last me several winters.Keep in mind that they are thick enough to make your usual work shoes/boots tight.  You may have to replace your shoes much more loosely (which is what I did, or buy winter shoes a 1/2 size larger.",5
B014IVTLXS,"Extremely soft and comfy; moderate thickness and warmth. They do attract pet fur and lint. Unclear how they will hold up over time, but even if they turn out to wear quickly, they are so reasonably priced they would still rate 5 stars. I donated 20+ pair to organization serving homeless after learning warm socks were high priority items; please consider similar donations.",5
B014IVTLXS,Well worth the money keeps my husband's feet warm and cushioned because he has plantar fasciatis  best socks ever bought for him and the wool is soft and not itchy like you would think  love these socks,5
B014IVTLXS,"Soft, medium thickness (thicker than tube socks, thinner than 100% wool), warm, stretchy. When you take them out of the package they do look as if they'd be too small, but they stretch as you put them on and give a good fit without being bulky or saggy. I'm 5'10"" with size 10 feets, and they fit very well - the tops come up just over the ankle, and stay there without falling, so they give complete coverage for boots. I've included a photo so you can see just exactly how high they go up. They're also nice and warm - not Arctic temp warm, but seasonal. I have NOT had a chance to wash them yet, to gauge shrinkage, but due to the materials mix I don't expect a problem with cold water wash, and feel confident enough to at least test out a pair in warm water wash, and low heat dryer. I'd say it's a good deal.",4
B014IVTLXS,"Socks are nice and thick, very warm and comfortable to wear. However, after wearing a pair just ONCE, there is already a hole in one sock. Right on the toe, not something I could even wear out so quickly. Hopefully this is a one-off, haven't even worn each pair of socks yet.",4
B014IVTLXS,So comfy and fit perfectly. Very breathable for being wool socks.,5
B014IVTLXS,"Nice fit, long wearing. Comfy socks, keep me warm. Pleased with this purchase.",5
B014IVTLXS,"With the weather getting colder I decided to buy these because they appeared thick enough for my toes, that always are the main part of my body to get cold, and appeared adept enough to withstand the chilly draft inside most of my classes. I wear women's size 10 and many socks barely fit me so I figured mens socks would provide a better fit and they do. The only downside is at the heels where my shoes rub against the socks there's fuzz that gets annoying to look at but it's mainly a complaint regarding the aesthetic quality. These socks are extremely soft and warm enough to withstand the cold from winter and for the most part do keep their shape when put in the wash (only one pair shrunk) so I do recommend them to anyone looking for soft warm socks for the colder seasons.",4
B014IVTLXS,Returned the product. Looking for better.For the price might be good for some.,3
B014IVTLXS,"Like the socks.Soft, nice material. Tops are not tight. Size is right for me; lady who wears men's size 8 bootsCould be thicker; is not true heavy thick winter socks (but is pretty thick, good!) and I prefer higher socks so my boot tops do not scrape my lower legs. Needs be about 2 inches higher. I need thicker socks due to foot injuries.On humid days; the sock's flurry material comes off and sticks to my feet. Feet covered with black lint.UPDATE Feb 2, 2021; I changed to 5 stars. Recent new purchase - socks sent are thick. And feet better on this hard vinyl cold floor and in boots. Will be wearing 2 pair.Maybe buy some thick knit slippers with soft rubber/knit sole I saw on Amazon.",5
B014IVTLXS,These socks are just what I needed.  They are super comfortable and feel great even after long walks.,5
B014IVTLXS,Super thick and comfortable.,5
B014IVTLXS,"These socks turned out to be way better than I'd expected. They're super-soft but they're also compressible enough to fit in slippers and shoes. And they're sooo warm, and surprisingly breathable too; my feet stay nice and dry instead of getting sweaty. I use them as sleeping socks and they're perfect for the job. When Dumbledore told Harry Potter what he saw in the Mirror of Erised, these are the socks he had in mind.",5
B014IVTLXS,"I live in Minnesota where wool socks are my normal go-to lounge around the house socks at least 4-5 months out of the year. These socks are incredibly comfortable, have a good range of colors in the selection, and are just the right amount of breathable that my feet don't sweat while wearing them in a variety of indoor and outdoor temps.As I note in the headline, this is my second time buying them because most of my original pair (from 2 years ago) have holes worn through on the heels and elsewhere. For the amount of times I've used/washed them and walked outside on concrete when you're not supposed to without shoes...I consider to have gotten more than my money's worth out of that original purchase and am gladly returning for round 2.",5
B014IVTLXS,"These are great super soft and thick merino wool socks. Packaging says 55%wool, 25% cotton, 15% polyester, 5% spandex. Softer by far than the ones I got for myself that were supposed to be angora (for 10$ more!) so I may order these for myself too. Very stretchy. Husband and son wear 11-12 size and they say they fit well. Very pleased with my purchase.",5
B014IVTLXS,"These are very nice comfortable socks which need to come in two (2) sizes instead of ""one size fits all sizes from 6 - 12"" (or whatever the claim was), which they don't really. They fit a bit low on the ankle of one who wears size 10 or above in my opinion. That's why the one star ding. I would think they might be just right for sizes 6 - 9.Otherwise they are great socks which will keep my feet happy this winter. If I had tiny feet these would be perfect, as the quality seems to be there.I want to know if these socks come available in size 9-12.",4
B014IVTLXS,these socks are pretty close. Warm and comfortable. Highest personal rating would order again.,5
B014IVTLXS,They are super warm and comfortable,5
B014IVTLXS,"I read the other reviews before buying, so I expected the short top. That is typical of socks made to be sold in China. For some reason, Chinese  businessmen don't mind show a lot of ""shin skin"" when seated. Yes, they are very short, covering about two inches above the ankle for me and I wear 7.5 wide shoe. I would not recommend these for anyone over size 8.5 (""Title"" above was chosen automatically, not by me; size 8 is fine; size 9 would not be happy; size 10 would probably not be able to wear these socks). The label reads ""MADE IN CHINA"" with Chinese characters below that in non-standard syntax with the meaning ""qickly wear it under boots"". ALL OTHER WRITING IS KOREAN!!!! Also, the fabric content doesn't translate correctly. The Korean character for the 38% fabric is NOT the one for wool. The other fabric characters are correct. Someone made these socks, and is not perfect in writing Chinese, so I suspect they were some type of second or over-run bought in a different country, labeled suspiciously, and then shipped to Amazon. Four stars for quality, comfort, two stars for sizing, one star for suspicious labeling.",3
B014IVTLXS,"Finally Finally Finally, socks that live up to the description of being soft and well cushioned! I've been so disappointed in the past by these claims from other companies. These socks are exactly what I have searched for!! They took a long time to arrive even with prime, but wow, so worth the wait.",5
B014IVTLXS,"I find some wool socks are too thin and my feet get cold.Other wool socks are too thick and my feet get hot.But these wool socks ARE JUST RIGHT and my feet are comfortable all day long.Buy a size bigger.  Wash once before wearing, always in cold water and hang to dry.",5
B014IVTLXS,"I bought these socks to add some comfort to my boots, and these things definitely met my expectations. They are very comfortable and soft.My only gripe with these would be that they slip off you're feet pretty easily, but that's not an issue while wearing shoes or boots. I would definitely recommend trying these out.",5
B014IVTLXS,"These socks are thick, warm and ideal for the cooler months.  I love them so much I ordered two sets!",5
B014IVTLXS,"I bought these as a gift for someone who needed cold weather socks in neutral colors and am blown away by the quality! They are SO soft and plushy/squishy! I thought that being wool, they might have that scratchy quality, but they don't at all. Each pair is bundled, so I didn't want to open any up to further inspect, but they look to be the perfect length and are nice and stretchy at the opening (will fit on someone with bigger calves) They look exactly like the photos on the seller page, if not better--they actually look well-made/expensive! (how often does THAT happen on Amazon?!) If these make it through the washer and the winter season, I will 10/10 repurchase!",5
B014IVTLXS,I bought these sox because my old winter sox had lost their elasticity and had become a struggle to get on.  I was pleasantly supprised when I received these.  They are very soft and comfortable and easy to put on.  They are also very worm and comfortable.I held back a star since I won't really know about them until they have been washed a few times.Update. One year laterI was concerned that the Sox might loose their elasticity over time however they have held up very well.  Good enough to order more!  Great product!,4
B014IVTLXS,"I was skeptical about the one size fits all cause I'm a size 12 but they fit, not too tall and not too short. And soft soft soft, I'm hooked.",5
B014IVTLXS,"These are well made, soft and  warm. They fit good and are high enough for my ankle boots. Feel comfortable when out for a walk. I order a second set. Like them alot. I like throwing everything in the dryer, so that may be my only complaint, but I knew that because of wool. I got the second set anyway. That's how warm and comfortable they are.",5
B014IVTLXS,I do a lot of walking and needed thicker socks to help prevent blisters on my toes. I tried them on as soon as they arrived and love the feel and fit on my size 12 feet. They really keep my feet warm around the house. I will be getting more of these.,5
B014IVTLXS,"I loved the way they felt and looked. As this was given as a gift, I have no input on wear or washability.",4
B014IVTLXS,Lightweight warm soft and very comfortable on .,5
B014IVTLXS,I like the colors because I can wear them with anything,5
B014IVTLXS,"Wool socks can sometimes be scratchy, not these. 70% wool kept my feet nice and warm around the house, stretch material was comfy, thin enough to fit easily into shoes. With regular running shoes stood for 5 hours in 45 degree weather, lakeside for a crew boating regatta and my feet were toasty. Great socks.",5
B06XWLXMM4,"I'm thoroughly impressed with the Amazon Essentials Men's Tank Undershirts! The pack of 6 is a fantastic value, but what really stands out is the exceptional texture of the material. It's incredibly soft and comfortable against my skin, making it perfect for everyday wear. The quality is top-notch, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the design. Highly recommend!""",5
B06XWLXMM4,"The cut of the tank top is similar to other tanks I've owned and the overall fit is great, the material feels soft against the skin, my only complaint is they're 3"" to long. I've washed the tops many times and they hold their shape well and all stitching has remained intact.",4
B06XWLXMM4,"Satisfied with the style, sizing and price.",5
B06XWLXMM4,"These were on sale and at a little over $2 per shirt, is a great deal.  My son said they are comfy and he likes the style and color.",5
B06XWLXMM4,"These are good shirts and longer than most of the other a shirts I've gotten. The stitching on the bottom hem started coming out of 4 of them after the first wash but overall, I like these ones better than Hanes of Fruit of the Loom.",4
B06XWLXMM4,As described,5
B06XWLXMM4,Enough pack of shirts,5
B06XWLXMM4,awesome,4
B06XWLXMM4,Washing even once a month after wearing several times each because I wear wife beaters every day they won't hold up to the Past wife beaters. They're definitely nice and would be great if the black would hold up,4
B06XWLXMM4,amazing fits perfect,5
B06XWLXMM4,I ordered these for my boyfriend and he was very happy with them.  He said the sizing was just right and the feel and quality was great.,5
B06XWLXMM4,This men tank tops/undershirts are comfortable. I got black and the color has not faded. They also are the true size that I order.I would buy more,4
B06XWLXMM4,Too long and also too thin.!,4
B06XWLXMM4,Very good,5
B06XWLXMM4,Great fit comfortable material and great price highly recommended,5
B06XWLXMM4,Comfortable and long just like I like it,4
B06XWLXMM4,"I like them so much more than the Hanes ones, the fit is so great",5
B06XWLXMM4,Not see thru stretchy soft and very nice,5
B06XWLXMM4,I bought these at that large size so that I can sleep in them they're very comfortable for winter and summer. Nice breathable cotton,5
B06XWLXMM4,Is way more large,4
B06XWLXMM4,"Comfortable fit, cotton blend",5
B06XWLXMM4,Regalo,5
B06XWLXMM4,Great value for the price,5
B06XWLXMM4,They are very soft and comfortable,4
B06XWLXMM4,Fit comfort looks,5
B06XWLXMM4,"Comfortable and love how thick the fabric is, not a thin sheet as a top.",5
B06XWLXMM4,Best fit!,5
B06XWLXMM4,"By far the most comfortable tanks that wash well.I wear the grey ones as a pj tops, and the black ones when I work outside and sometimes under a hoodie...I bought my first pack years ago and they have been washed many times and they are still going strong.I am stocking up for me and my family.They are so worth the price.They have lasted years!",5
B06XWLXMM4,The fit is good but I don't always wash things before wearing them but these should be washed first as the color bleeds.,4
B06XWLXMM4,"Nice and wide and short fit. However, these were needed for a tall slim fit. Though they were kept. Next time we'll have to shop for a longer smaller fit.",4
B06XWLXMM4,"Now sure yet how the quality is over other 2 well known brands I used to buy.Important just as with any brand to wash before wearing for the first time.Classic advice from my Doctor many years ago, as I was having a rash back then to have checked out.Within minutes, my Doctor asked me if I wash my undershirts, t-shirts etc before I wear them, which I was not.  Problem solved!",4
B06XWLXMM4,fabric great sturdiness good very comfortable smell free color awesome shrinkage free.,5
B06XWLXMM4,Nice and long,5
B06XWLXMM4,Bought these and washed them thinking they would shrink like other ones I've bought in the store but they didn't. Remained true to there original size and feel soft.,5
B06XWLXMM4,The  tank tops are perfectly slim and very comfortable.  I wear them under my work shirt and it they're very breathable cotton. Similar to the Hanes ones that you buy at Target ir Walmart. They stretch out nicely without feeling tight or constricting,5
B06XWLXMM4,"These are really good, they feel well made and a decent price",5
B06XWLXMM4,"He liked them, but could be thicker.",4
B06XWLXMM4,Short and got loose after wash...very strange,4
B06XWLXMM4,Great price and quality,5
B06XWLXMM4,What can I say... ordered and received,5
B06XWLXMM4,"They shrink after one wash so I highly encourage to get a size up from your usual size.Other than that, love them! Been self conscious about my belly lately so these black tanks definitely makes me look slimmer.",4
B06XWLXMM4,Excellent!,5
B06XWLXMM4,They shrink,4
B06XWLXMM4,This product is a set of 6 tanks to wear and fit perfectly on my son. You get 3 black and 3 grey in this package. I feel they are well made and tagless also.,4
B0734GX9YT,"Pretty thick shirt, nice tight collar with longer short sleeves. Haven't washed it yet, overall good first impression",5
B0734GX9YT,My Husband absolutely loves wearing pro clubs. The color is exactly as described. True to size. Great price for the quality. They last a very long time. Would recommend this product.,5
B0734GX9YT,These are Authentic Pro Club Tee Shirts. The Quality is there. Great Value for your money and size is accurate.,5
B0734GX9YT,"Let's get right in, the material sucks I have sand paper in the garage that's softer than these shirts, I ordered 2xl long the first time one was washed it shrank to an extra medium save your money to bad they don't sell single shirts so you can try one before ordering a big pack",4
B0734GX9YT,"Quality of the shirt is great, size is perfect, super comfortable.",5
B0734GX9YT,"Bought these for my oldest son. He loves these shirts, its the only brand t-shirts that he wears. These were on special at the time I purchased them, It was a steal so I had to. Unfortunately they did not have my size or i would have bought some for myself. Very durable.",5
B0734GX9YT,I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He said they are perfect! He loves them! Heavy duty material and perfect fit.,5
B0734GX9YT,"I love these being a bigger guy, everything else in XL or XXL ends up shrinking and being too short. I am 5'10 215lbs and these are perfect. Love them for an every day T-shirt. I have bout about 3 packs at this point. I would not recommend for an undershirt unless you live in cold weather. The neck is a little tight but stretches fine. Just a little small than most other neck sizes. Only downside would be the neck being a little tighter than I wished.",4
B0734GX9YT,"Good quality, soft. For my child",4
B0734GX9YT,NICE GOOD DESIGN FIT SNUG AROUND NECK MADE TO LAST GREAT FOR WINTER.,5
B0734GX9YT,"Love the quality of the material, especially the neck band.",5
B0734GX9YT,The shirts are used daily and the quality of them lasts.,4
B0734GX9YT,My son says they feel so comfortable.  He will buy other colors.  Wrinkle resistant and great value for three shirts.  Large sizes fit great. He has not wash the shirt as of yet.  No shrinking,5
B0734GX9YT,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Insanely comfortable pack of plain white baggy shirts. They fit amazingly and they go great with hoodies, jackets, or even on their own. Their incredibly thick, and their insanely white. HOWEVER, they do slightly shrink in the washing machine so I personally go a size up.",4
B0734GX9YT,Perfect exactly what I expected,5
B0734GX9YT,Wouldve been 5 stars if one shirt wasnt stained with some white powder,4
B0734GX9YT,Me gusta mucho proclud,5
B0734GX9YT,Fits and feels great. Holds shape. Have bought another set. My husband loves them.,5
B0734GX9YT,Heavy cotton. Quality t shirt,5
B0734GX9YT,"First, these are good T-shirts. I ordered size large. After washing and drying, they now fit my grandson, who wears size medium. My high school grandson likes them, and will get good use from them.  That is the only reason I rated them 4*.I didn't try them on before washing, so I don't know if it's shrinkage, or if they were small to begin width. The fabric is a bit thicker than 'regular' T-shirts, but not a lot. Enough to be noticeable but not distracting. As other reviews said, the neck hole is a bit smaller than most T-shirts. Personally, I like that, except I can't put it on while wearing my glasses.I'm on the fence about ordering XL shirts hoping they will shrink to L but if you are interested in these shirts, I suggest you consider getting one size larger than normal. And you probably should check to see if any other reviews mention size issues.They are good shirts,",4
B0734GX9YT,Great heavy weight,5
B0734GX9YT,These T-shirts are nicely made with even color. They do shrink at first washing.Had to go up one size.,5
B0734GX9YT,Nice fit. Runs small,4
B0734GX9YT,"These shirts have great fabric and are tight around the neck. I wish they were a little longer at the bottom, but still well worth the money.",5
B0734GX9YT,Good quality. My husband wears them often.,5
B0734GX9YT,"I liked everything, thank you so very much, sincerely appreciate you guys, Mr Daniel Morris Omaha Nebraska.",5
B0734GX9YT,Grandson loves them,5
B0734GX9YT,Item fits and is heavier material.,5
B0734GX9YT,Great for keeping shirt tucked in when job involves bending over constantly during the day.,5
B0734GX9YT,"These T-shirts greatly exceeded my quality expectations. The longer sleeves and sturdy neckline provide a robust, well-constructed feel. If you're looking for durable T-shirts, these are the ones to buy! It's becoming increasingly rare to find cotton shirts that aren't thin and flimsy these days. I've already placed another order. If you value comfort and durability, you absolutely must try these T-shirts!",5
B0734GX9YT,i got the black proclubs awhile ago its going on a year now they where very good i just got the white ones and they are not as thick  and feel odd but time will tell ig,4
B0734GX9YT,High quality T that are a steal at this price.I bought one and after 2 washing bought more.Your gonna like it.Richard,5
B0734GX9YT,"Good quality, but I ordered a large and they sent me a medium.",4
B0734GX9YT,nice shirts for the money,5
B0734GX9YT,perfect,4
B0734GX9YT,happy with my purchase.,5
B0734GX9YT,Good size good lenth good materials,5
B0734GX9YT,Perfect quality,5
B0734GX9YT,Tela muy gruesa muy buena calidad,5
B0734GX9YT,"The material is quite heavy, which is what I wanted but a Large size was extremely tight.  Felt more like a medium.  Had to return for a larger size.",4
B0734GX9YT,My favorite shirtsThick and really good quality,5
B0734GX9YT,Everything nice and bright white,5
B0734GX9YT,Satisfied with purchase.,5
B0734GX9YT,Liked the almost mock neck.  Good value for the money!,5
B0734GX9YT,Good quality just run small in size to regular tshirts,4
B0734GX9YT,"These are high quality, thick, feels durable.  Nothing flimsy about these.  Highly recommend.",5
B0734GX9YT,2 out of the 9 shirts I ordered had a stain on the shirt. But other than that fast shipping and high quality shirts,3
B0734GX9YT,10-Oct,5
B0734GX9YT,Price cost. Thickness,5
B0734GX9YT,Very good quality,5
B0734GX9YT,I like the thickness of the shirt,4
B0734GX9YT,Excellent quality. Holds shape and always looks nice.,5
B0734GX9YT,"These are the thickest and best T-shirts Ive ever purchased. I hope nobody else buys them because I want to be one of the few to wear these, lol. Best thing is that have a longer sleeve and a thick and sturdy neck.",5
B0734GX9YT,"I have only worn these a few times, but so far so good.  Like others, I got tired of the wimpy collar, wimpy fabric, too-short-arms tshirts that we have all had.  So I got 3 of these to try them out.  I'm still trying them out, but I ordered another 3 in a color.These are a beefy fabric (like maybe Carhartt-beefy fabric?  Close, anyway.)  They may be a little too thick to wear under a long sleeve shirt or flannel shirt like some of us do in the winter.  I'm not sure yet.  And the collars are tight.  Others have reported on this, and it's true.  They are a bit scratchy (the whole fabric is) but then they haven't been washed much yet maybe that will go away.  I guess I'd rather have the collar a little too tight than saggy.  Like the rest of you I suspect, I've had enough saggy collars to last a lifetime.So I rate these a 4 but it could go up to a 5 with a few washings and some more wearing.  They are stout tshirts!",4
B0734GX9YT,"These were bought as undershirts. They are not soft. They are heavy and abrasive. Not what I was looking for. Also, no packaging. They were sold in bulk.",3
B0734GX9YT,Neck is not big enough,4
B0734GX9YT,Quick shipping and authentic,5
B0734GX9YT,"forever only getting proclubs from you guys! best deal and always the right sizes found. and if you know pro clubs you know they are great quality, thick shirts. and comfy.",5
B0734GX9YT,"Seriously. Is there any other collar that you'd prefer? Minimal shrinkage. Total comfort. Fits like a boss (undershirt, or stand-alone). Value has gotten away from ProClub (I'm assuming due to demand) and is now on the high-end of t-shirt costs.... But dang! I can't go without them... Thick enough for warmth, yet breathable.  I'm a for-lifer with ProClub, no other way...",5
B0734GX9YT,I was looking for a thick cotton tee that I could wear as a regular shirt. i didnt want a super soft shirt that was essentially see through in sunlight ( those are my under shirts...) so if you are looking for a shirt as ive described this is a good shirt. Some complained in thier review that it was a coarse material. This one is not soft combed or egyptian cotton but it is cotton. However the beauty obout them is the shrinking is minimal ive washed mine 2x with minimal shrinkage. keep in mind it is still cotton so you dare wash them in hot water at your own risk.,5
B0734GX9YT,"If you have a teen son, you know they can be picky to find the right shirt.  He doesn't like graphic T-shirts and finding a good plain one can be difficult.  He chose the Pro Club Men's 3-Pack Heavyweight Cotton Short Sleeve Crew Neck T-Shirts. My son loves the length and weight of these shirts.  Even though we live in a hot area, the heavyweight cotton shirt is breathable.  I have washed these shirts 1000 times and they hold up well to washing and drying. I also like that the armpit area doesn't get that classic yellow staining from armpit sweat.  These shirts are a hit. I will buy more for another year at HS.",5
B0734GX9YT,"After reading the reviews about this product, and getting swept by the positive feedbacks, I decided to purchase the 3-pack for $25. I was going to purchase another pack for a total of 6 shirts, but I am glad I did not because the quality on this shirts are disappointing. They shrunk at least 3 inches after the first wash and the neck area did not retain its famous tight sitting shape at all. It is baconed and wiggled like a wiggly worm.Money wasted.",3
B0734GX9YT,I had to upsize to XL because they were narrow in the lats. I wanted longer tails. The best shirts I have bought in a long time. The neck is tighter than most tee shirts but relaxes. The weight of the material is impressive. I immediately ordered more!,5
B0734GX9YT,"My son only buys Pro Club brand white T-shirts because of their thickness. He can't stand thin, see-through shirts, and so far, this is the only brand he genuinely prefers.",5
B0734GX9YT,This is the only Tshirt brand my daughter will use.  Long lasting and is not see through.,5
B0734GX9YT,These were purchased as a gift. Was told that he liked them.,4
B0734GX9YT,Great t-shirtLove the fact that they are thick and don't have a stretched neck like many othersFits Great will buy again,5
B0734GX9YT,"Neck isn't PERFECT but these are farrrrr superior to hanes beefy Ts. You won't get bacon neck, but they will roll in on ya a bit after wearing",5
B0734GX9YT,I've been looking for undershirts with a tighter neck. This is the best so far,5
B0734GX9YT,I wish they had these in 4x tall otherwise this is a 10 out of 10 and the metal is great!,5
B0734GX9YT,Every day use,4
B0734GX9YT,"These are great material. Much thicker than the average white t. Wanna look like a prisoner? Get these t-shirts. Do they also charge $10 per white t-shirt in prison? They're very long, so they're great for covering your underwear over your sagging pants. Wanna feel like you're being choked by cotton? You'll love them. Dressing up as ""America's most wanted"" for Halloween? Bingo. Add some white Nikes and jeans...Boom. Jax Teller. Want a regular white shirt to wear under work shirts? Don't buy these.",4
B0734GX9YT,"I'm 6'7"", 255 lbs, and my dad always told me to wear a T-shirt under my shirts at all times, as they catch the sweat of a big man, and these definitely do that. The tall size is long, very long, and I love it as I have a long torso. They shrink just a bit, but avoid washing them in cold water, and you will be fine. I have the white, which I love, but I'm going to order black next. I can't believe I found a worthy T-shirt at a great price.",5
B0734GX9YT,"Nice color, fits well, comfortable, holds up , grandson loves them",4
B0734GX9YT,Quality great,5
B0734GX9YT,"I recently purchased a 3-pack of these shirts in different colors, and they have exceeded my expectations. Unlike today's typical shirts, which are often so thin and clingy that they reveal every peak and valley of your body, these shirts are heavy and look good.The only common complaint is that the neck can be a bit too tight. Personally, I like it, but I can see how it might be an issue for someone with a larger head. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a solid, reliable t-shirt.",5
B0734GX9YT,These shirts cost like 15-17 bucks minimum in stores in Stockton CA,5
B0734GX9YT,"The material is fairly heavy. It's not super soft, but it's OK. The neck is tight. I'm 6' 190 and usually size L is what I take. This tee shirt is kind of form fitting and just long enough. If you like your shirts a bit looser and a bit longer I'd recommend going up one size and maybe getting the long version. Overall though I expect these to last a while.Update 4/13/24- Purchased a pack of XL shirts. Material is fairly heavy still and a bit stiff, but neck opening is more comfortable. More room the way I like a tee. If you're between sizes, I'd go up one. They do tend to soften up a bit after several washes.",4
B0734GX9YT,"Fit is very nice a little long you have to be 6'2"" and up if you order the xlt. But great quality nice fit",5
B0734GX9YT,"Great quality material, but sizes run small.",4
B0734GX9YT,"My kid loves pro club. These are bright, the fabric is heavy duty and withstand a 13 yr old who still gets active and goes outside.",5
B0734GX9YT,I like the fit of the pro club.  But why is the plus sizes way more expensive,4
B0734GX9YT,they fit well around the neck.,4
B0734GX9YT,Good quality cotton shirts.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,"I recently purchased the ROXUN Arm Sleeves for my daily outdoor workouts and I couldn't be happier! These sleeves provide exceptional sun protection while keeping my arms cool and comfortable. The cooling fabric feels amazing, even on the hottest days, and the compression fit offers great support without being restrictive.The UPF protection gives me peace of mind knowing my skin is shielded from harmful UV rays. Plus, the sleek design is a bonus that looks great during any activity! I've worn them for running, cycling, and even casual outings, and they never slip down or bunch up.Highly recommend the ROXUN Arm Sleeves for anyone looking to enhance their performance and stay protected in the sun. They're truly a must-have for any active lifestyle!",5
B0C2JMJKSL,"4 different Colo's and since i've Never gotton Any, i was surprised by the length, softness, and ease to put them on.. Great!",4
B0C2JMJKSL,Got them for my husband since he works delivering for amazon he is out in the sun a lot and this provides protection from the sun. The size is perfect.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"I got a size I thought would fit. I have larger than average arms for a woman and I wanted these for when I work outside. They slide off me after a while, though. The material is nice and the colors are fine, I just think they are too big for my arms. They would be great sun protection in the summer if they would stay up.",3
B0C2JMJKSL,"Perfect for sun protection, lightweight, works well with warm weather.  Good value",5
B0C2JMJKSL,"I ordered these to hide my tattoo at work at Buc'ees...  I was worried I would get hot while wearing these... But no exaggerating... Not only did I NOT sweat under the sleeve, but it didn't itch or bother me in the least.  Once I walked out of the kitchen area, that arm actually felt a little cool.  Definitely recommend.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Honestly, I've bought a lot of different sleeves and it's always touch and go with the material quality. But these ones are well made. I don't have many issues with them rolling down like others. The fabric is pretty solid but also breathable and soft. If I need more, I'll probably end up returning here.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,"I wish I knew about these sleeves long time ago.It really protects your arms from the sun coming in through the car window,it stays in place,even there is no thumb hole at the end of the sleeve. Great product",5
B0C2JMJKSL,This is long enough to cover from wrist to shoulder.  But it slips off my shoulder and only covers from my wrist to above my elbow.  Maybe that is what it is supposed to do?  Compared to similar compression socks I have these seem like they should have stronger elastic.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Great for outdoors. Had it on for an entire day.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Good quality.  Long. Good price. Don't buy the other selection (Neon pack of 12) CHEEEAP!THESE ARE BETTER!,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Great uv performance, doesn't slip",4
B0C2JMJKSL,Good.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,These really seem to help my arm with the compression on my sore muscle.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,I love mine works great. Glad to have them will purchase more.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,I purchased these to put under a brace after a bicep surgery. They protected my arm from the brace and made it comfortable because of the cooling fabric. They looked and stretched nicely over the arm.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Very comfortable and nice and cool,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Good value.  Great sun protection. Also compression,4
B0C2JMJKSL,simple and do what they are made for. good price,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Grate price good color,5
B0C2JMJKSL,The sleves are easy to put on and work well to cover my tattoos!  The price is amazing!  I would suggest you buy them!,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Muy buenas me sirvieron Perfecto,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Love these! Especially for travel ( when packing lite). Put them on in the am and as it warms up, take off & put in pocket or purse. Would highly recommend!",5
B0C2JMJKSL,It fits comfortability.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,My daughter loves this arm protection to play volleyball,4

B0C2JMJKSL,Just as described superfast delivery AAA+++,5
B0C2JMJKSL,My son loves these. They are good quality and very comfortable,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Very comfortable not itchy and did protect my problem skin as needed also did not shrink when washed,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Good fit grandson loves them,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"My husband just started a new corporate job and was a little worried about people noticing his tattoo sleeve, so we got these to wear under his dress shirts to prevent people from seeing it through them them. They work perfectly, and he says they are comfortable and they wash well.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,100% recomendable,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"It was definitely breathable and helped to reduce the kickback of the ball. i loved how it felt, though it was a little loose around my wrists because im a bit skinnier in the wrist area. other than that its pretty good, might irritate your skin / make it itchy as you continue playing but not as bad as how the itchiness would be after playing a normal game without it.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,Good fit,5
B0C2JMJKSL,It fit great and the material is very good and comfortable,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Armbands are OK unless you want more compression. The compression level is more medium/mild.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,I like how it fits,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Buen producto, excelente calidad, funciona perfectamente",5
B0C2JMJKSL,Ideal for golf or outdoor activities. Made of good quality material.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Recomendados.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Gets the job done decent quality,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Bought for a golfer friend to keep the sun off his arms,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Amazing,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"I got one pair of more expensive arm sleeves plus one package of 4 pairs of these, based on a review that said there is little or no difference.  That is true.  In fact, the more expensive one are starting to unravel at the seam with only one wearing but these are doing well for my husband who wears them twice a week when he plays golf.They are not really compression sleeves, but serve mostly as sun screen protection and that is what hubby needs because he has had a lot of skin cancers.  He is a medium size ""old guy"" and the sleeves fit nicely but are not tight at all.IMPORTANT NOTE:  The page says machine wash.  DO NOT DO THAT.  All the negative reviews show that they can't take the normal agitation of most washing machines.  Use all the pairs from your package, and then hand wash them and hang them on hangers to dry..  Woolite is your friend!",5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Love this UV protection for my arms when riding, the only this that was missing yhatbi added was some reflective tape which I added yo improve my visibility.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,"These work great. Protect my arms. Don't fall down, aren't to tight. Would recommend.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,I like these to protect my skin from the sun when I'm driving. They can be a bit uncomfortable at times on the upper part of your arm and occasionally they do move and I have to keep adjusting them to keep the sun off me.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,I love these they fit just right and basic colors go with everything,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Cheaply priced and shipped quick,4
B0C2JMJKSL,"I like this because it shelters my arm from any air .  But, it should be made for a smaller framed individual so that everyone gets the full benefits of its usesx these are too big",4
B0C2JMJKSL,Got it for golfing and it fits my arms nicelyKept me cool during the hot blazing weather and feels a noticeable difference between having it on and off. I also see the tan difference on my hands and my arms. This is a very good arm sleeve. I also washed it once and they are pretty quick to dry.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Great to cover sun in arms. It is breathable.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,Arm coversRolls down arm,3
B0C2JMJKSL,nice simple product a great buy,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Still got too much sun,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Daughter wear  for volleyball,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Works very well for the most part however after awhile having them on they were irritating my skin. My arm was almost like stinging in several areas.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,I didn't find them cool as mentioned but enjoyed wearing the to keep my arms out of the sun. I ride for 1 1/2 hours almost daily and my arms were suffering in the summer heat.  These are a big help. Lost a star bc felt like long sleeves and not really cool.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,"I tried these for 3 days in a row for my bus driving job. They worked wonderfully for my lower arm, but my upper arms are too fat for me to use these. The top edge of the sleeve rolled and acted as a mild torniquet. I had to keep repositioning them and they still rolled, along with making very sore line around my arm if I left them in the same spot for too long. I still have sore areas today, 18 hours after last use. So if you don't have extra large biceps and/or fat upper arms, they'll be very good for you. I decided to go with a full long-sleeve T-shirt for comfort and blocking the sun on my arms.",4
B0C2JMJKSL,Bueno,4
B0C2JMJKSL,I got to hide tattoos at work. Black and dark great totally cover tattoos. Light grey and white are more see through but it does the job,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Very comfortable. Good for working out walking or just sitting around.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,"Comfortable and work, but thought they would be thicker.",4
B0C2JMJKSL,Soft and stretchable,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"These arm sleeves are good quality, excellent value for the money. Set of two is perfect. Size is good on me offering light compression, however my arms are small--would provide higher compression for someone with larger arms. One note--this set does not have thumb holes, which is something to consider if you want to have coverage for most of your hand.",5
B0C2JMJKSL,The photos describing the product make it look like the sleeve goes all the way up the arm.  It only goes about 3/4 the way up.,3
B0C2JMJKSL,I bought these for my 11 and 6 year old they are too big,4
B0C2JMJKSL,I like these to wear with golf shirts to protect my arms from UV light. They are tight enough to provide some compression and are very light making them great in warm weather. I carry a pair in my golf bag and gym bag for workouts.,4
B0C2JMJKSL,I bought these to wear with a tshirt when running a race. The temperature started cold so the sleeves were perfect. Once it got hot I pushed it to my wrists and that was fine. Eventually tied it to my water pack and they were out of the way. Got the job done. My husband and I both used it for running and it fit both of us easily.,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Have only used one pair so far. Durable and comfortable. Long enough, but additional length would beneficial for someone with long arms like me",4
B0C2JMJKSL,Fit well and didn't slide down after using for a full work day of wearing. Didn't feel uncomfortable or noticeable that they were on. Lightweight and breathed so I wasn't hot. Loved,4
B0C2JMJKSL,Ripped easily but they were still tuff,3
B0C2JMJKSL,These do exactly what they're designed to do. They protect arms from exposure. Love!,4
B0C2JMJKSL,It does its job for me and I wish I have more,5
B0C2JMJKSL,"Apparently one size does not fit all. These are really tight on my upper arms, almost uncomfortable. I am on the large side. Might be better for ""normal"" sized people.",4
B0C2JMJKSL,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I use these to cover my tattoos in the sunlight. I like how thin they are, how easy they are to out on and how they can cover my full arm. Only complaints is that that tear fairly easily and once they get stretched out they stay stretched. Buy a big pack.",4
B0C2JMJKSL,size and quality excellent,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"These are great to keep in your purse, backpack, car glove compartment, etc.  Great for travel, they take up so little space, and the price is right.  I used in the Rainforest of Costa Rica and stayed very dry. The only problem was that it was quite warm out, and it did get a bit hot under the plastic. But no way to avoid that if you enjoy staying dry!",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,I ordered these to use on water rides at universal. They were great and did not take up hardly any space in my carryon and fit in my fanny pack. They also worked perfectly at universal as well and kept us dry.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Perfect for what you need it for. Came in small bags so it fit right in my purse. It kept me pretty dry at a football game.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"After being soaked on a previous Disney vacation, I decided to plan ahead and get these disposable ponchos for a recent trip. Being July, rain was forecasted at some point each day. There were four of us, so plenty of ponchos in this package to go around. Even though the plastic was thin, it was durable enough for the rain, and fit well over a backpack. We were able to shake off the poncho easily and  store it again for the next use (which was frequently some days). We got many uses out of it and then disposed of it after our trip. It was a great value and I would purchase them again.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"This was super lightweight to travel with, but it was for sure 1 use only.",3
B0B2W3RH1Q,"We took these to a icky weather football game.  It was warm but rainy.  These were great because they were tiny in the package so easy to carry around then when we needed them, they were thin, but worked like a champ.  Would recommend for cheap rain insurance!",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"These were perfect - my group was marching in a parade, and we wanted to be able to show off our colorful shirts. These ponchos were perfect. One size fits all, but honestly even the biggest of the men were able to fit comfortably.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"Packing lightly for a quick trip with limited space and unpredictable fall weather, these were perfect to throw into my backpack. Umbrellas can break or be left behind and raincoats are much more bulky. It did rain a bit while we were walking and they came in quite handy! The only draw back is that they were so huge/one size for us; it would have been nice to have them in a smaller size. I also keep them in my car for when an unexpected rain situation occurs and it's too windy to use an umbrella!",4
B0B2W3RH1Q,i vacationed in Florida and needed something i could carry in my pocket that i could toss at the end of the day. and it served its purpose. i will say the hoodie is a bit big and u will have to hold on to it on a windy day,4
B0B2W3RH1Q,Good item and product,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,These disposable rain ponchos are fine for me.. they are smaller than some I have ordered before,4
B0B2W3RH1Q,We used these on our last Disney trip. They saved us a ton of money and help up pretty well.,4
B0B2W3RH1Q,Great for one time use and you get a lot for the price,4
B0B2W3RH1Q,"The ponchos were a little thin, but worked well in the rain. The opening for the head were a little small, but  overall they were pretty good.",4
B0B2W3RH1Q,"I'm thrilled with these ponchos. I bought them a year ago for a trip to Hawaii, but didn't need them until today, in Denmark. It was pouring rain and I needed to get from my cruise ship to the tour bus/coach, and these ponchos worked. They are clear, thin, and lightweight, but when I got caught on a coner, it did not tear. I am a very large person- a size 6xl, and the poncho fit around me and my large backpack comfortably. Easy to shake off and roll into a ball. I took it on and off 4 times today, and it is still as good as new. Great value for the price, and helpful that they are packaged individually.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"I have already used three of these ponchos, and I highly recommend them. They fit neatly into your pocketbook or even in the trunk of your car. On one occasion I handed one to a friend who was shopping with me when we were caught in a rainstorm. Needless to say, she was very grateful!",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"These are each individual packaged, easy to open and a nice lightweight poncho. I would have liked the sleeves to be full length but I just put my arms inside to keep my sleeves dry.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,These are perfect to go to a MLB game with no umbrellas. Carry  in pocket and pop out to use. All is good. One time use for those MLB rain games.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,I purchased these for my trip to Portugal and they came in handy. It rained one day and I was able to give everybody on the trip a poncho.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Good for football games,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,I bought these for my husband who is a crossing guard for the elementary school. They are great and you can see through them and can see his crossing guard vest.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Packed  easily for an outingHeld up well in a down pourReasonably priced,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,It works. Does what it's supposed to do,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,They work but your arms get really wet should have longer arms,3
B0B2W3RH1Q,"For the price, this item was a lifesaver for my family who went to the New York State Fair in the middle of a heavy rain storm.. very durable and easy to put on and off.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"I purchased these rain ponchos for our vacation and there were perfect.  Small, easy to pack and carry with during sightseeing.  I'm now keeping the extras in my car for unexpected rain during day-to-day travel.  A great back-up when the weather changes unexpectedly.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,they were individually packaged which was nice. a bit thin but they are disposable so it was fine.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,I bought this for a trip and used it a lot. I used it at least 4-5 days not just once. It keeps you and your shopping bags dry during the heavy rain,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Just what I needed for a hike.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Cost less than the $1.25 at the dollar tree. Fits Large and small adults. Clear so we can wear our school colors proudly at the football game.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,One side fits all.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Haven't had to use them yet.  I carry them in my bag for football games.  If  sudden rain happens I'm prepared.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"Convenient, cheap and easy to store.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,VERY THIN MATERIAL,3
B0B2W3RH1Q,They're big which is great because they cover my bookbag completely,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Perfect for emergency use!,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,My mom got these for me for a school trip. I used a couple when it had rained and they were perfectly fine. Although I felt like I was wrapped in a plastic baggy it kept me dry and was all I needed to shield from the rain! Easy to fit into bags or normal-sized pockets.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Fits right over power chair back cushion...keeps it dry after a swim...Great protection in general...,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,I bought these for our Alaskan cruise but we actually never used them. They look and feel durable and the price was reasonable. They are small enough to stash in bags or purses.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"This save me on my trip to London, it was pouring and helped me stay dry. Of course, they are disposable (so, it's not easy to fold if you want to keep it) but the material is OK and the size as well.I'm 5'7 and it was a bit short on my arms and just a tad above my knees.They comes in a small (individual) bag around the size of a palm or small wallet. Good to keep in your purse (for travels or concerts) without holding up too much space.The hoodie was a bit small for me and kept sliding off but, I just clipped it to my bucket hat so, it worked out for me.Will buy more in the future as they are ok for the price.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Good product. Definitely used this weekend.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Would not withstand much of any wind,3
B0B2W3RH1Q,I ordered these to take to a Cincinnati Reds ballgame and they were perfect!,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,For one use wearing and throw away when done they were perfect.  Small in size before opening and I am a bigger girl and there was plenty of room and helped keep us dry during a rain storm at a concert.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Products was exactly what I was looking for.,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Cheap & effective,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,These worked so great for our trip to Disney when it rained!,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"Bought these for a trip to disney world, they worked out great with the random rain showers in Florida",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                We bought a 12 pack, they were perfect for the Indy 500. Lightweight and easy to throw in a backpack. Everyone took them on and off a few times due to the rain, they are thick enough not to tear easily. We will buy again for the next event.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,They are roomy and fit over any ourfit/backpack!,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"I bought these for an outdoor concert with rain expected.  Sure enough, it down poured.  These fit all of us, from someone that is 5'4"" to another friend that is over 6' tall.  We would have been soaked if it weren't for these.  I would purchase these again any day!",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"These were decent quality and worked as needed.  They are really one a one-time, maybe two-time use.  They're thin, but lasted the whole day.  Keep in mind if your arms are through the arm hole (without some other form of water proof cover), they will get wet.  There aren't sleeves.  (Worked well over my rain jacket too keep my back pack and butt dry.)",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,I have always used these since I was younger especially at concerts I have never had issues with them and they do work well,5

B0B2W3RH1Q,Very thin,3
B0B2W3RH1Q,"My family made fun of me for ordering these for our summer vacation. We live in southern California and NEVER EVER see any summer rain, however I wanted to come prepared for what the East coast might bring on.. and good thing I did, mommy always know best right?! Pittsburgh and New York City showed my kids what REAL monsoon summer rain looks like.. and these ponchos were a lifesaver !Lightweight and gives you almost full body rain protection. About to order a second pack to keep on hand.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,Worked great at Disney! Never know when a random storm will pop up in Florida!,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,"Purchased just in case we needed them at Dollywood, and turns out we did. Kept my mom dry in her white pants on the River rampage ride, while everybody else was soaked.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,These are absolutely basic but great for that sudden downpour or an outdoor event. Toss it when done.,4
B0B2W3RH1Q,"I bought them for Disney. While they are very easy to carry and are compact (why I am giving a 2 stars instead of 1), they were so uncomfortable, I just ended up buying different better ones at Disney. They felt like I was wearing a garbage bag. They stuck to my skin and just felt awful and the water didn't shake off. Don't bother. I also found these at Walmart for a $1 each. These are basically $2 each.",2
B0B2W3RH1Q,"I like that they are clear and light. Perfect to carry in purse, back pack or car. And they came right on time.",5
B0B2W3RH1Q,They are light and really work/ protect me from getting wet!,5
B0B2W3RH1Q,What I liked is flexibility to move and not feel restricted,4

B0B2W3RH1Q,"Purchased for Disney, used them all during an all day trip to Animal Kingdom",5

B0C2FQSL7K,Great Product!Always an Amazing Fit!,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"comfortable, true to size",5
B0C2FQSL7K,Comfortable and well made.,4
B0C2FQSL7K,same great quality he expects. thank you,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Exactly what was promised.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Nice.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"At first I thought I was wearing breaches but now after a few months, these are my go too, supportive and comfortable - and as a gentlemen of need in support - marvellous.",4
B0C2FQSL7K,Men/boys of my house have been wearing these for over 10 yrs.  Buy cheaper  and buy more pairs! or buy  a few pairs of these that will last!!  Worth the $,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I just bought a 3 pack of these and I LOVE them. I'm super active; walk/run/hike 60 miles a week and I need underwear that doesn't ride up my leg. I also want underwear that is comfortable, will keep me cool, and keep everything where it needs to be. These do exactly that. I recently bought the 6inch version and didn't care for them because they kept riding up my leg. These 9inch versions are perfect for me. I'll be buying more of these.I'm 5'7 160 pounds.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,My husband said these are his favorite because the waste band holds up well unlike other brands. They are pricey so I try to catch them on sale when I can.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Very comfortable,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I went a long time dealing with the bulkiness of cotton boxer briefs under jeans. It literally felt like you were wearing two pair of pants. I tried these and loved them. I immediately ordered another pack of 3. If they have a down side, it's the cost.",4
B0C2FQSL7K,I got XL and they fit really well. The waist band doesn't roll up which I like.  They are a good weight and they were true to size from the description.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,II could find cheaper products however these have the quality I was looking for.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Awesome for working out,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Good fit and comfortable,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Love the quality of the product  and it's exactly  what I wanted.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"Received these and immediately put them on and ran a half marathon in them the same day.Good:Material is nice - smooth and soft. Not too thick, not too thin.The seamless legs are great and didn't cause chafing.9"" length is appreciated over the 6"", which isn't long enough to prevent rubbing (my thigh gap is nonexistent)Waistband didn't fold over or rubLegs didn't ride upHas a flyBad:ExpensiveGot pretty warm in the Southern heat and humidityFit was very snug (I'm 6', 205 lbs, 34"" waist) - I ordered a large. Waist was fine, the pouch was very small/constricting (and I'm not exceptionally well endowed or anything). I'd almost go up a size but they would then be too big in the waist.Unfortunately they discontinued my go-to Terramar silkskins, so these were a trial two pack to see if I wanted to buy 15-20 pairs. I think I'm going to continue my search and put these in the ""when I run out of everything else"" pile. They'll do, but won't be my first choice. Ordered a pack of the New Balance, so we'll see how those do next.",4
B0C2FQSL7K,This is all my so  uses he says they are the perfect fict.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Love the deal and these wear forever!!,5
B0C2FQSL7K,CALIDAD EXCELENTE,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Always buy these for the men in my household.  They love the comfort of them and they are durable.  They last long.  We will continue to buy this brand.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Seriously - you deserve comfortable underwear. It took me 40 years to figure that out. Spend your money where it counts: good food and good undies.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Hes 11.  Wanted longer underwear for sports.  Previously had ones that constantly rode up - so he would mess with them non stop.  These stay put and are longer so his semi see through sports shorts are more discreet now,5
B0C2FQSL7K,My husband loves these underwear! They last so long and so comfortable.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"My son wears Under Armour underwear and has for years.  Great product!  Wears, fits, is comfortable and durable!",5
B0C2FQSL7K,Great quality. My husband really like them.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Excelente tela,5
B0C2FQSL7K,I've tried many various brands of boxers and UA just makes the best fit. They're comfortable and long lasting.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I Bought these for my husband. He normally wears  Under Armour briefs in XL, but in this XL pkg,  the briefs are tight. The quality is fine, but if we order again, will order the 2X. Don't know if the ""Performance Tech"" style is meant to be tight, but just beware...",3
B0C2FQSL7K,Silky smooth material.  Nice support.  Cool style.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Love this product. Respectfully; HJP,5
B0C2FQSL7K,A comfortable fit and I no longer have to feel damp when I exercise.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Good fit,5
B0C2FQSL7K,My son loves these! He says they are super comfortably and fit great. Will buy again!!,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Quality price plus very durable you feel nice and cool comfortable and good price. Recommend.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,They are very comfortable. Especially if wearing during extended periods and doing a lot of movement.,4
B0C2FQSL7K,I finally found a pair of underwear I love,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"Would be great for an hour or two activity, but wearing all day to work leaves you swampy.  It doesn't seem to evaporate very well.",3
B0C2FQSL7K,"Only XS was on sale, it fits me tightly. I like it. It is comfortable",5
B0C2FQSL7K,.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,This is the second time I have ordered these for my husband because he liked them so much.  They are well made and wash well.  A great item.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Delivered as advertised,4
B0C2FQSL7K,Only underware I buy... they last and breath.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"5'11"" 230 XLThese are among the most comfortable underwear I have and I have tried many. Great for everyday wear and I make sure to wear these when doing outdoor activities.Wearing the wrong underwear hiking causes significant discomfort with thighs and testicles. These eliminate that for me.What I don't like.So why give it a 4? If I could 4.5 I would. My only complaint is that the marketing says it is breathable. I don't think they are as breathable as they make it out to be.",4
B0C2FQSL7K,hands down the only underwear i own.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,It's very good material fit as spected,5
B0C2FQSL7K,These boxers are sure to satisfy.  They never stretch out and wash nicely!,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Exelente,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Soft fabric and comfortable fit.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Comfy and worth the money!!,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"My partner used to play ball and only wears these now because of it. I stole a pair one night and let me tell you...  *CHEF KISS* unlike other anti-chaff sorties for the ladies, there was no swamp crotch from non-breathable fabrics or a deliniating line from where these chonnies end by all of the shorties for ladies that -must include- some sort of compression. No rolling up.As a chonky legged lady who lives in a state that tries to kill people in the summer with  triple digit temps - these  bad boys kept the swamp crotch and  chub rub at bay for this gal.Seriously - better than anything else... and the bonus crotch pocket?  Don't mind it.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,Perfect fit and soft comfortable material.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,My son loves these!!!,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"These have become my go-to undergarment. Actually, (I know it's TMI) but they have become the ONLY underwear I wear.  The 6-inch version tends to ride up. Not so with this 9-inch size.  They stay in place all day long, regardless of my activity.  I used to buy the same version in  what they called ""Charged Cotton"" but they discontinued that fabric.  I was hesitant to buy this 100% synthetic fabric, thinking it would encourage sweating, but it does not.  This stuff is also extremely soft, but very durable. I have worn these for several years and they continue to hold their shape and show no signs of wear.  Amazing, really. They  are pricey, but totally worth it.  I will continue to buy these ""Boxerjocks"".",5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I order this under Amour boxerjock for my Son and Husband because they love how it feels soft,comfortable and breathable.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I have been buying these for quite awhile now and I genuinely love them.  Material is fantastic and the 9"" inseams don't ride up like the shorter ones do.  They are a bit warm in the summer months, but I tend to run hot so maybe that's just me.My most recent order included two pairs in the gray color and I feel like they run a bit tighter than the black ones.  Still wearable but felt it worth mentioning here",5
B0C2FQSL7K,These are not like regular Boxer briefs but longer underwear. Still soft good material. Just pay attention to description.,3
B0C2FQSL7K,Best boxers ever. I've worn these and only these for years. They feel great and prevent leg chafing if you're a bigger guy. I have recommended these to many guys who have had chafing issues.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"Wearing these you take a chance on your pants sliding off, but they are comfortable, and I appreciate the longer length.  Just beware when you do the ref's touchdown signal, you might be previewing the half time show!  A little less slide would be appreciated, like in the Hanes Total Support Pouch briefs, that I find just a little more comfortable too.",4
B0C2FQSL7K,I would size up next time.,4
B0C2FQSL7K,Buen producto aunque crei que eran mas gruesos en la tela.,4
B0C2FQSL7K,Love the length,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Great fit. Do not stretch out when wearing,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Ordered for my husband...They are comfortable and true to size. My husband loves them! The only underwear he will wear.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Correct size and fit,4
B0C2FQSL7K,"I bought these to supplement my UA shorts I bought in 2015 from Amazon. The older ones have given me good service, but the elastic has gotten tired, but not by much. I hadn't realized they had aged until I gotten these new pairs. Pricey, but worth it, cuz they are very durable. The boys are very happy in these shorts.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,"My son is extremely picky about under garments and he really liked these. The fit, the style, and the color.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,"Perfect for my husband who is a delivery driver...since he is constantly getting in and out of his truck (in addition to us living in a desert state) he sweats a lot that would lead to chafing. He has tried standard cotton boxers to high end designer brands and nothing would really help him but since he has had Under Armour brand, he has found relief and comfortability. He swears he won't go with any other brand now except for Under Armour Techs",5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I like the long boxer briefs and these fit great. I don't wear regular ones anymore, just this brand. For the price point, I own a few pair and I plan to get more colors.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,At least one par had a seam that came loose other than that I like them.,3
B0C2FQSL7K,Fit as per the spec.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"These are perfect. They look good, are very comfortable, and fit well. They stretch out and easily return to their original shape. I've had them for over 6 months and they've been very durable. They've been worn for 20+ mile hikes, rock climbing, Spartan races, numerous crossfit workouts, and long workdays. They feel great against my skin. They prevent chafing on long runs. They dry quickly after getting out of a pool or river. I just wish there were more color options available.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,they're so comfortable,5
B0C2FQSL7K,"I wear these in combination with the UA heatgear tactical shirts during Texas summers. They make a world of difference, drying quickly and cooling in the process. Maybe a little TMI here, but they also put a barrier between your inner thighs of you're like me and put on a few pounds during lockdown. They also make a great addition to these new super short workout shorts. Do your gym a favor and grab a pair, no one wants to see what you got up there.",5
B0C2FQSL7K,I love these underwear. The nine inch length is perfect for me,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Been buying these for years.,5
B0C2FQSL7K,Super soft and comfortable.  Awesome fit.,5
B073R29T2P,"My husband loves that they are thin. He gets too hot in sweatpants but he likes the cuff that pajama pants don't have. These are true to size. They have pockets and they are comfortable. Because the material is thin, it would be easy to get holes in them.",5
B073R29T2P,"Orignally I had bought these pants for work, and just to give some insight I work with food, grease, dirt, all of that. And these joggers hold up pretty well, I will say that they do collect alot of dirt, lint, and just random stuff but i guess what do you expect esp with black clothing. Anyway, the fit is pretty good for me, im pretty short but I do lowk have some curve but these arent too long, tight, or anything they fit basically just right. Would def recommend these for work, casual, and at home wear!",4
B073R29T2P,I bought these for my son and they fit in very well. The size was perfect and the style matched the picture.,5
B073R29T2P,"My favorite for indoor workouts.  Much better cut and construction than comparable Hanes(!), although the Hanes has great material, the same as their Beefy-T shirts. The material is not heavy for keeping warm in winter. The cut of these and other joggers is more athletic (trim) than regular sweats. You could wear these joggers under loose pants as a thermal layer, but not alone in the cold outdoors.",5
B073R29T2P,"Washed once, worn once and the stitching on one of the cuffs is already fraying. Fabric isn't soft or comfortable. Aesthetically  appealing however.Update: after some consideration I upped the rating to 3 stars. The fabric has softened with washings. Any fraying has ceased. I actually really love these pants and think they appear flattering. I do wish the material were like the Adidas Essentials joggers as these pick up a lot of lint & require a lint-roller. I am satisfied with my purchase and would purchase this pair again if it were on sale with a nice discount.",3
B073R29T2P,Great look,5
B073R29T2P,"These are very comfortable and fits me perfectly. I bought the medium, I'm 5'11 and 150 pounds. Great value for sure",5
B073R29T2P,"Very true to size, but the quality is very thin.",4
B073R29T2P,a little tight,4
B073R29T2P,Looks good.Easy to use.Makes a great gift.Soft and cozyWarm and fluffy,5
B073R29T2P,Decided to send them back because it did not match the hoodie we bought of the same color and brand. I just wished their colors matched across-the-board and we would have kept both the hoodie and the pants.,4
B073R29T2P,"Overall perfect. From fit, comfort, material and overall performance, I highly suggest these!",5
B073R29T2P,There pants were comfortable and fit well.  True to size.  They were perfect for traveling in.,5
B073R29T2P,"Excellent sweats, these are my number one go to, wear around the house sweatpants.",5
B073R29T2P,Nice and cheap joggers that are comfortable.,5
B073R29T2P,"no complain on the quality, it's not super thick of cotton but it's completely fine for regular use. Worth it.",4
B073R29T2P,These joggers are exactly as they say lightweight . They are so light you feel like you have pjs on ! They are good quality but super thin!,4
B073R29T2P,This is my second time ordering these ... They are  what I Wanted. Light weight and Comfy to hang out at home and sleep in.Thank You To The Seller.,5
B073R29T2P,I love the pockets. They are super comfortable use them to lounge around and work out. The material is not like a fleece more cotton like. Nice black color. Not too warm keeps a good temp. Got them on sale for 12$,5
B073R29T2P,Bought this as a gift,5
B073R29T2P,"My husband, who recently had surgery and has never worn anything but jeans, was relucant to wear these, but needed a roomier pair of pants.  Once he put them on, he was a happy camper.  They are very soft and stretchy.",5
B073R29T2P,I got them for my brother for Christmas. He is happy with them,5
B073R29T2P,"Well made, but not real soft, Ordered my usual size and too constrictive in legs (like skinny jeans) These are very slim fit.",4
B073R29T2P,"First, the positive - These do appear to be real cotton, the length is fine, and the shrinkage in the wash is minimal. The overall quality and construction, however, are definitely not genuine. I don't believe these are authentic Champion items; I've never see Champion create such poor quality. The fabric is extremely thin, the seams are not strong, the cut of the design is unusually narrow with very tight legs. Not just a contemporary narrow/lean design here; I bought 3 pairs and they are all tight in the legs, while roomy at waist and rear. Since the fabric is cotton, they do have stretch, but it's almost like wearing leggings. After a single wear and wash, there were holes on the outside seams at the pockets and crotch, and the logo is peeling off. Since I just need something to wear while working in the garden in southern heat, these are adequate after repairing the stitching/holes. I would not recommend these unless you just need some temporary items; these will likely last around 6 months before needing replacement.",3
B073R29T2P,"This jogger is soft, good quality, and comfortable. I love using it to go to the gym, and the university.",5
B073R29T2P,High quality,5
B073R29T2P,I love champion joggers and shorts for work last a long time like over 2 years and priced right not too heavy and very comfortable for work,5
B073R29T2P,They fit & very comfortable.,5
B073R29T2P,Nice light weight swets,4
B073R29T2P,"So comfortable, not thick really at all. They do have pockets.",5
B073R29T2P,Comfortable and good fit,5
B073R29T2P,"I'm on my second set of these pants - the originals lasted two years as daily drivers of WFH attire on a hard mesh chair before holes appeared at the butt region. Based on how often they were used and how abrasive my chair can be, I would say they are good value.",5
B073R29T2P,The only issue is that they will pill eventually after a bunch of washes but they do hold up pretty well.,5
B073R29T2P,"I wore these for a few months around the house and to bed and noticed after a short while that the crotch area was hanging lower and lower, until it looked like my backside was down to my knees. This is a caution to anyone who thinks they will look cool wearing these pants.",3
B073R29T2P,Great around the house pants.,5
B073R29T2P,"Fits well, comfortable, and durable so far. Hasn't shrunk after washings.",4
B073R29T2P,"Fits true to size; however, if you like a slim fit look down size one smaller",4
B073R29T2P,Very nice.,5
B073R29T2P,"I am disappointed that the pockets don't manage to be the right size/shape to keep my iPhone in when I sit down.  Basically my phone falls out each time I sit down, rendering these joggers fairly useless for wearing on a regular basis.  I also found them to be lighter weight than I was suggesting, more like pajama pants.",3
B073R29T2P,Will shrink and fade after few months,5
B073R29T2P,"Fits perfectly, I'm 5'10, 108 pounds.The color isn't that black it was in the photo but, oh well.",5
B073R29T2P,"these are very thin material not very warm, low quality",3
B073R29T2P,Good for the price. The fabric is a little thinner than I expected but it works anyway. Size M is slightly bigger than usual,4
B073R29T2P,Outstanding Performance from the product. Fast shipping as well.,5
B073R29T2P,"I thought I was buying sweatpants, but they were more like t-shirt material. They got returned.",3
B073R29T2P,I think I was expecting them to be made a little better but if you just want something to clean your house in this would be good for it.,3
B073R29T2P,Even though these are men's pants I love them. It says my recommended size is a medium but I am going to order a small because the medium seem a little too big. I've been buying these for 2 years now. Very comfortable and they don't get the little balls on them after you wash them. They do not shrink.,5
B073R29T2P,Very happy with this,4
B073R29T2P,Very comfortable and well made.,5
B073R29T2P,"I wore these maybe 3 times and found a hole in the seam in the cheek area today. The material is kinda thin. These do not feel of great quality. The pockets are nice and deep though. Also, runs a little small.",3
B073R29T2P,"Word to the wise- I've probably worked out about 60 days a piece in the grey color and the navy color. Both size M, both a snug fit that I think looks cool (like a ninja or something). Snug enough to hold my phone & keys without feeling like they're gonna slip when I'm moving around. I'm 5'8"" 195 lbs.The navy color is 100% cotton, and has little holes where the pants are stressed (crotch area basically).  These feel like a liability and I think about them when I'm stretching or riding my bike.The grey one meanwhile, which is 60% cotton and 40% polyester, is holding up fine so far. It seems to have more elasticity and feels more comfortable. Lighter even. And less given to feeling sticky or gross when I'm working out.They've both been great but they won't last forever if you're a real active type. The grey color (or at least their joggers with a 60/40% composition) feels more worth it and I'll be sticking with that next time.",5
B073R29T2P,It looks nice just smaller than I thought,3
B073R29T2P,Comfy and strong material good value for the money true to size and overall I am happy with my purchase!,5
B073R29T2P,My son loves these pants size fits perfect,5
B073R29T2P,Liked stylish,5
B073R29T2P,"Compared to other joggers brand, these champions are just thin.  I'd equate to being more like PJs than joggers.  The fit is tighter than expected and for me, I felt that that comfort just was not there.  It feels rough and not smooth.  Length is good and has nice pockets.",3
B073R29T2P,Comfortable and of good quality. Recommended,5
B073R29T2P,The length is good and size fits great however the material feels very cheap. I guess worth the price I paid,3
B073R29T2P,I normally only purchase cotton products to use around the house while relaxing. This pair of pants is not something I can use to relax. The material is so dense that I began to sweat while sitting.,4
B073R29T2P,These sweat pants arent going to keep you very warm as the thickness is that of a regular cotten t-shirt.  Not your normal thickness of sweat pants.,3
B073R29T2P,Great product,5
B073R29T2P,"Comfort: These joggers live up to their ""Everyday Cotton"" name. The fabric is super soft and breathable, perfect for lounging around or running errands. The XL size provides plenty of room without feeling baggy, and the relaxed fit makes them ideal for all-day wear.Style: While not the trendiest joggers on the block, these Champion classics offer a casual, athletic look that goes well with t-shirts, hoodies, or even dressier tops for a laid-back weekend vibe. The subtle Champion logo adds a touch of brand recognition without being over the top.Functionality: The drawstring waistband ensures a secure fit, and the pockets are deep enough to hold your essentials. Plus, the cotton material washes well and maintains its shape.Downsides: Some users mention that the fabric can wrinkle a bit, especially after sitting for long periods. Also, the lack of tapered legs might not appeal to everyone who prefers a slimmer fit.Overall: These Champion joggers are a solid choice for those seeking comfortable, everyday wear. They offer great value for the price and deliver on their promise of everyday comfort and casual style. Just remember, they might not be the trendiest option, and the relaxed fit might not be for everyone.Bonus tip: Pair them with your favorite sneakers for a laid-back look, or elevate the style with a bomber jacket and some Chelsea boots for a casual chic vibe.",3
B073R29T2P,Tallaje perfecto tela un poco delgada,4
B073R29T2P,"These are some of the most comfortable joggers I've managed to find, though they are on the lighter-weight side.  If you want something warmer, go for a thicker option.",5
B073R29T2P,"I am a small-ish woman, I wear a 4-6 in pants/jeans, and prefer a 30-31"" inseam when I'm not trying to keep up with short wide fashion pants (which flatter no one , imho). I got the small, and couldn't be happier with them. These are the absolute bomb. I have a black pair that I have worn for maybe 5 years, starting to wear a bit. They were 100% cotton. This time around I got an Oxford grey pattern, and anytime you get any heather in the color, you get polyester, but I knew that. I absolutely love these pants. I only wear them round the house, or for pajama bottoms in winter, and they are perfect.",5
B073R29T2P,These are nice joggers. But I did return them because they are very thin. If you are looking for thin joggers these are great. The price is right.,5
B073R29T2P,I LIKED EVRYTHING ABOUT MY JOGGERS AND GOT TO USE A COUPON,5
B073R29T2P,Too thin. Feels like pajamas.,3
B073R29T2P,"While they do shrink slightly in the wash, they are comfortable and make my butt look great.",5
B073R29T2P,Love it,5
B073R29T2P,"Bought on sale. Have a similar version, but better material. Material feels like the rough cotton material you get with hardware store rags. Cut is semi-fitted-what I was looking for. Neater looking, and practical for biking. If on sale, it is fine.",3
B073R29T2P,"Good quality, and a good value when Amazon puts them on sale. With pockets and elastic waistband and at the ankles, they are very comfortable.",5
B073R29T2P,"I got a pair of these a couple yrs ago, and wanted another pair. I'm tall, and like the quality and fit of that first pair.Sadly the pair I just bought are not the same quality material.  Much thinner.The cut is still good, but why change the material?? Disappointed.Wondering how they'll wash.Won't be surprised if they fall apart or fray. :(",4
B073R29T2P,"These joggers would have been great for working out, and even casual wear out and about. I wear a ""Large"" in most athletic wear, and my pant size is a 30 waist by 34 length. I bought these joggers in the size large, and they were even a slight bit baggy out of the bag.I only wash my clothes in cold water. After the very first wash, the joggers fit me like a pair of leggings, they had shrunk so much! I manually stretched them out to wear for a workout in the garage. I washed them again, and now I can't get them on. I big waste of $25.",2
B073R29T2P,Fits perfectly and very comfortable!,5
B073R29T2P,"THE QUESTMy quest was to find joggers for lounging around at home, but I was having trouble finding any with deep enough pockets to keep my phone from falling out when I'm doing said lounging. I put some time into this quest because I had cracked the screen on my last phone when I was sitting at home and it slipped right out of my pocket.THE CRITERIA- deep pockets: my phone is 6"" tall (~ iPhone 11 & 12)- light-weight- budget around $20- drawstring- cotton (60%+)THE CONTENDERSI had already checked a couple department stores with no luck, so for this test I ordered a bunch of random pants that seemed to meet most of the criteria:Amazon Essentials https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P7L18ZSRussell Athletic https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00719XLAOChampion https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B073R28JZZJMR https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B072YM9LG5CandyHusky https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DYB31XELater my wife saw me comparing pants and busted out her joggers that actually had deeper pockets than any of the ones I found. Unfortunately her brand doesn't sell Men's, but they do go up to XXL so I picked up a pair and I'm including them:Promover https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DHPZX8CTHE RESULTSPocket depth rankings: (see pics)1. Promover 6.5""2. Champion 5.75""3. CandyHusky 5.25""4. Russell 4.75""5. Amazon 4.25""6. JMR 3.75""The CandyHusky was super lightweight and came in 3rd for depth but the pockets are sewed to the front of the pants which was a deal-breaker. I need pockets that are free moving so my phone can settle into a secure position.The Champions technically came in second for depth but the Promover pocket is much more narrow at the bottom so not all their depth was usable. I tested both with my phone and it was almost a dead heat. Since the Champions are lighter weight than the Promover I gave them the victory and I've picked up a couple pairs to keep. I'm going to keep the Promovers as well for wearing outside in colder months. Their women's XXL fit me great and are plenty long (I'm 6'1"").THE CHAMPIONChampion",5
B073R29T2P,"These sweat pants fit me quite well. I'm 5'7"" 180 lbs and most pants I buy tend to have legs that are too long. That's why I searched for sweat pants that have cuffs. I wanted a lightweight material (jersey) without a fleece lining because I sleep in these in the warmer months in Michigan. The material is perfect, and the leg cuffs, which are just the right amount of tightness, keep the pants from wearing too uncomfortably long.  The waist is also just right (I chose a 'large' size). The only quibble I have is that the waist drawstring is a loop  that is just too long. It was far too easy to catch a toe in it when putting the pants on. So I simply cut the loop and trimmed off some excess length from both ends and I tie them together in a bow. Perhaps that's what we're supposed to do anyway, but I didn't see anything in the labels or online that stated that. Anyway, I'm very happy with it. You just have to do some minor surgery.",5
B073R29T2P,"A bit longer than I expected, other than that is good, not great, but just what you expect for the price",5
B073R29T2P,Very comfortable.,5
B073R29T2P,Good quality. Good fit.,5
B073R29T2P,Price is great and he said these are his favorite joggers out there!,5
B073R29T2P,"Not what I expected, great for sleeping and lounging after showering, but not comfortable wearing in public/gym.",3
B073R29T2P,I ordered 4 pair and they all fit different. Most are to long definatly not the 31.5 inseam as they claim,3
B073R29T2P,"These are thinner than your usual sweat pants/joggers.  That is what I wanted, as I tend to get hot very easily and therefore want to minimize my heat production.  Also it is 100% cotton, something that is becoming harder to find nowadays, as polyester will cause static build up and eventual shocks me at some point and I am frankly tired of that.  The only thing wrong is that these joggers can tear easily, again they are somewhat thin.",3
B073R29T2P,I don't know why the thousands of 4 to 5 star reviews. I've had this pair of joggers for about two weeks now and the stitching is coming off around the waistband in multiple places and once it starts it won't stop. It's falling apart. And it's VERY thin material. More for wearing around the house than wearing outside.,2
B073R29T2P,Great pants. Fit nice. Great quality,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"Las medias lucen bonitas, pero la calidad del elastico no es buena. En mi caso no llegan al largo debajo rodillas, algo mas bajo, y me hicieron dano en la piel que duro varios dias. Es mejor comprar unas mas Caras y de mejor calidad, xq al final perdi dinero y medias.",3
B0BX3H5FNK,"One of the pair  had a hole in them upon arrival but not worth the time and efforts to return for a replacement. All the others were okay and the fit is nice, not so tight and easy to put on.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,"These were just what I needed for an overseas 9 hour flight. My legs did not swell at all and were comfortable. I also used these when touring for long trips between different places on the bus.They fit all the way up the leg, but are not too tight. Having a wide variety of colors makes it easy to match all kinds of outfits.A good buy with good quality. I would highly recommend these to anyone.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"For the most part, these fit great and are super comfortable. The only issue is the llama one- there's a few strands in the design that are much tighter than it should be. The socks are built so well that I couldn't just break and stretch it. It hurts on the calf area so I threw them away. The rest of them are beautiful! Color is nice, reduces swelling, very supportive, loose on the toe area, and very durable.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,"Works well, fits perfectly, comfortable.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,I like these socks because they are pretty and easier to get on than the usual compression hose . I am not ashamed to wear them. Also they are comfortable.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"I opened the sock up this morning only to find a large hole on sole of the sock. I have worn three pairs so far without any holes. I have two pair that I haven't opened yet and I'm hoping not to find any holes in those either. Overall, the socks are comfortable. I was even thinking about ordering more but then when I saw that hole this morning, I was extremely disappointed.",3
B0BX3H5FNK,"Very comfortable, even after a 10 hour flight, I wasn't in a hurry to remove them. Effective at helping my feet/ankles not swell during long flight. Attactive colors, don't look ""therapeutic.""",5
B0BX3H5FNK,These are game changers for this 75 year old! Have tried all kinds of orthopedic socks over the years and hated them all! Could not get them off if I even got them on! These are easy to get on and really do support and keep swelling in control!,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it. Very comfortable and helpful,5
B0BX3H5FNK,If you wear a size 5-6 they may be a bit too big on the feet like they were for me. Otherwise I think they would be great socks!,4
B0BX3H5FNK,Wife seemed to like them is she recommends!,5
B0BX3H5FNK,I wore these on several overseas flights and long bus rides. Also while doing a lot of standing. They definitely helped with swelling and overall feeling of fatigue in my legs. Support is firm but was not too tight. The reason for 4 vs 5 stars is that they are very basic in look and style. The toe area is rather baggy but was not a problem for me since my shoes had a roomy toe-box area.  I would not be able to wear with some of my other shoes.I would buy again!,4
B0BX3H5FNK,"I love these socks! They are very comfortable and fell well made. Plus, I love the designs!!",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"Perfect for flying when pregnant! Enough compression, but not too much where you feel like you are losing circulation.  Highly recommend",5
B0BX3H5FNK,Works well,4
B0BX3H5FNK,really like them. fun designs and have decent compression.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Perfectly fit and are extremely easy to put on.  Legs feel so good during the day.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Work well and great price,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Would have been nice to have mostly dark colors,5
B0BX3H5FNK,I have Osteoporosis and bone pain Especially winters with restless leg syndrome. They are great. Perfect length and great fit. Work nicely in my boots as well.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"Fits great, not to tight but snug as they need to be. I wear a shoe size 9 in ladies and this come all the way up to my knee cap. I am 5ft 6in and I love the fit and comfort. They are fun to wear with the scrubs and when I am walking around the house, even goood for my toes that get cold and cramps from time to time",4
B0BX3H5FNK,Purchased this for my daughter who is a server.  Looks like regular socks but really helps. Will order more since they come in other stylish options.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"Comfortable socks; bought for long travel. Some tore within a year, expected better quality.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,These socks meet my need for travel.  Good choice.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"I purchased a pair of Compression stocking from CVS- cost $40 and hard to get on, Theses stockings fit so well, are comfortable and a great bargain for the money they cost. I would highly recommend these and would buy them again when I need replacements.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"I put the socks on my swollen achy feet this morning. I though that maybe I would have wanted more compression in the arch and ankle but it was great around the calf. As the day wore on, I realized that my feet were feeling better and better. I will see how things go after washing them. I wanted to give it 4.5 but the quality is good and my feet are happier than they have been in a while so I rounded it up.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"These socks realky helped me after my surgery, and they are so much nicer to look at than the ones you get from yhe hospital. Thank you!",5
B0BX3H5FNK,Helps with my tired legs and feet after working 12 hour shifts easy to put on.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,The socks are easy to put on and the best fit of all my socks.  I just wish I could find a little more compression but they do keep most of the swelling down.,4
B0BX3H5FNK,Easy to get on and off. Seem to be working very well. Consistency of pressure is great.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,They are ok but I wish the XL size was actually for a little bigger legs. They feel like for a 150 Pounds person not a 190 or 210 pounds person.,4
B0BX3H5FNK,"I bought these specifically for a 14hr plane ride. My feet didn't get overheated or cold. Comfortable enough to ""sleep"" in.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,they are very hard to get on but the do the job!,5
B0BX3H5FNK,My underwear and my always discreet order are perfect. Can you send me the other pairs of socks?COOLOVER Copper Compression Socks for...Size: Large-X-LargeColor: 39 Purple 6 Pairs,3
B0BX3H5FNK,I was looking for pink. The argyle pattern is pink. The striped pair is more Freddy Krueger red n the one that should be pink spots is more red. The polka dot ones the spots are very small... If I received the wrong color please send me pink!!!,3
B0BX3H5FNK,me encantan las medias,5
B0BX3H5FNK,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These are very comfortable but not a ton of compression in my opinion. They really were a good price and I do like the colors.,4
B0BX3H5FNK,It really good for work walking all day,4
B0BX3H5FNK,"Bought these for the wife and she needed more and they fit great no issues.  I would say the color choices for here and nice.  She did mention that a different pair was a little more snug, but she still believes these are really great and they have been washed several times already and no discoloration and the elastic seems to be holding together quite nice.  I would recommend to air dry to not put in dryer.Great product would buy more for sure.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,Great for helping to control swelling without being too tight. The quality is good and I love the colors. Exactly what I was hoping for!,5
B0BX3H5FNK,These are very comfortable and are easy to put on and take off,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Gracias llego en tiempo feliz navidad para todos,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"I am short, these where a little to long",4
B0BX3H5FNK,Nice and stylish.,4
B0BX3H5FNK,Some fit well,3
B0BX3H5FNK,Had the toe area shred prematurely,4
B0BX3H5FNK,"These are very sturdy compression socks.  Just the right thickness (no chance of putting a hole in these!) Just the right length, below the knee. The 2 colors show exactly where the heel should be (huge plus!!) They are not scratchy and take worry the money!",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"These are definitely cheap in price and quality, not worth your money.  Spend a little more for e something better.  The fit in length of foot runs big.  The top of the leg is much too tight, actually cutting off circulation.  I keep going back to these socks, each time forgetting how uncomfortable they are.  I like the colors because they more professional than the bright patterns of most (better quality) compression socks out there.  Thank you for reading, I hope my review helps you.",3
B0BX3H5FNK,"Wore them around the house, they were comfortable !",4
B0BX3H5FNK,"Not only bright colors and fun designs, but they flamingos made my Cardiologist laugh--he had never seen such compression socks before.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"I decided to order some new compression socks as I was getting bored of my current stash. I adored the different animal designs of this set and how vibrant the colors were. I knew that they would make heads turn at work . They arrived and I tried on a pair to make sure that they fit. OMG...THESE SOCKS FELT SO SOFT IN MY HANDS AND WERE SO EASY TO PUT ON!!! I am ecstatic with my order. So why am I only giving it 4 stars instead if 5? The packaging that it came in was a transparent bag with a slight tint on one side. Anyone that handled it could see what I ordered. I have ordered apparel online and most, if not 99%  of the companies, shipped my items in a opaque white bag.  That may seem minor, but it didn't sit well with me.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,I first purchased these compression socks in a large/extra large. I lost 25 pounds so I reordered them in a small/medium.They are exactly the same size as the large/extra large.Extremely disappointed in the sizing.The quality is good so I will give stars for that.,3
B0BX3H5FNK,"I've never worn compression socks before so don't really know how they should feel but even though I purchased a size small as I'm a woman and wear size 6 1/2 shoes, they were so tight that I could only stand them on for a very few hours.  I felt like I was being strangled.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,"The toe fit is a little weird, but overall these are great especially for the price.  This is my 3rd order, and I have ordered for my friends as gifts.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,"Unlike many compression socks, these will actually fit large people, up to about 25-26 inches around the calf. I wear mine from when I get up until bedtime. Good compression and comfort. My spouse's calves are larger. She can't get them on by herself (physical issues), but once I get them started, she pulls them up by herself. She can't wear them more than five or six hours. Your mileage may vary.",4
B0BX3H5FNK,"For me, this is week two of total knee replacement and these socks are Heaven sent.  I will be wearing compression socks  24/7  6-8 weeks following surgery.The socks from the hospital serve their purpose but these are amazing.  Needing to wear compression socks that length of time masks comfort a key factor.  These socks are so comfortable that I'm not aware that I have them on.I would highly recommend them.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,I put these in my thank you basket for my Mother/Baby Nurses and they loved them. I even had one nurse come back and show me that she was wearing the socks the next day to work. Highly recommend getting these for your Thank You Nurse baskets.,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"If you only need or want light compression, these will be perfect for you. I was hoping for something a little more stout, but it's not really a problem because these socks are very nicely made. It's just that they are not much different than a normal knee high sock compression wise. They aren't too sheer, kind of a mid-weight fabric, which is a good thing since I wear them for warmth in a cold office setting. And they are not difficult to get on or off. The colors are exactly as shown, and they've washed and dried quite well. They are nicely made, and I would purchase these again.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,These stockings are mediocre as far as support and they are short on the leg which is ok for me but some women may not like that. I wear support hose all the time and will not purchase these again.,3
B0BX3H5FNK,Work well,4
B0BX3H5FNK,"This is my second time ordering this brand of socks! I was gifted another brand, and they were tight in certain areas where there was stitching, so they'd have to be cut to be wearable, but not these socks! Even with designs they fit perfectly, and have moderate compression all day long. My feet feel amazing everyday, even after being on my feet for 12 hours!",5
B0BX3H5FNK,"They are pretty. You can see the elastic between the pattern when stretched, but still looks good. Fair compression, but they feel tighter at the top than at my ankles. And don't get me wrong, they do help my swollen feet. But, they are not perfection.",3
B0BX3H5FNK,Medical treatment. I already had another pack of different colors to use.,4
B0BX3H5FNK,Uso diario,5
B0BX3H5FNK,I have order it few times already. My legs feel so much better after at work day. They last for long time. Very good quality and nice price,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Go with the size up from what you would normally wear. I wear a med/large sock and got the large/xl ones and they worked well and are super cute and are good for pregnancy swelling,5
B0BX3H5FNK,My ankles used to swell now they don't swell at all Best Buy,5
B0BX3H5FNK,Worth the money helps her legs,4
B0BX3H5FNK,I like need more tide for circulation help,4
B0BX3H5FNK,"Having P.O.T.S. sucks and laying down at night or sitting to long can cause my blood flow to go all wonky.  Someone suggested compression socks and wow!  I loved them but they were ugly, black socks.  OH so glad there are cure ones I can wear and still be normal as one can be in this world.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,Love these socks!!  They have stopped my ankles from swelling!!  They fit perfectly and I wear them every day!!!,5
B0BX3H5FNK,"I have swollen ankles and circulation issues, my ankles often pains due to long standing or sitting. These socks provide pain free days, I sometimes don't even remember that I'm wearing them. I chose the XL as I want the compression but not the tightness, and this works really well for me. Of all the compression socks that I've bought, this is by far the most comfortable and I intend to buy more.",5
B0BX3H5FNK,I dislike that they are supposed to be my size but they are so tight that they hurt when they are on and feel like they dig in too much. They are very stylish and cute. They seem to be very durable and they give you a lot for what little money I paid. They do have some stretch to them.,3
B0BX3H5FNK,Color Support Comfort Circulation Seam quality Durability,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I bought for the purpose of travel and outdoor use in those times where temps can change drastically from 70F in the morning down to 40F at night.I got this on sale for $20 which was a far cry from $60-120 asking price of other packable down jackets. For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine,  actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.It packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day.  The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.Sizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.I don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.12/28 edit:So I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect. I just had a t-shirt underneath and on top of this was a gymax waterproof windproof jacket. Again my only complain might be if the material doesn't last and it's a bit long.",4
B07BN7D19Y,"I have just gotten back from my trip to Japan in winter.  In my time there I am amazed by how often I used this jacket and how wonderful it was.First off it is surprisingly warm for the size.  I have a large REI travel jacket that is waterproof.  I noticed that when wearing that travel jacket I was cold!  I thought that the warmth of the travel jacket would have been equivalent to this puffer jacket, and I was very wrong.  It is very warm for it's size.It is very packable.  I often times packed it in the little duffle pouch, and pulled it out at evenings when it became cold.  It made all the difference, and kept me nice and warm.  It is part of a ""layering system"" and worked very well (Heat tech top and botton, jeans, a sweater, scarf, hat, and this puffer jacket).It was not exactly trendy, but did not look out of place in Tokyo.  Many many puffer jackets were on the streets, and it blended right in.  It was probably the single most useful purchase I made for the trip.  I wholly recommend this jacket.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"It's warm, lightweight and fits the size. I wish the sleeves were a tad longer or with expanding cuffs. The pockets are very very deep and wide, and the star age pouch was a nice touch. Looks a feels expensive and it does lean into for fitting fit but slightly. Have used on 23 degree with wind and survived! Very similar to North Face and Patagonia in quality and fitting. Highly recommend!",5
B07BN7D19Y,"I bought this for my husband because temperatures here in the north east were forecasted to be potentially double digits below zero and he needed something to cut the wind and help keep him warm. He hardly wears a jacket, so I didn't want to spend a ton. He was skeptical due to how thin this jacket is, but after one day in and out of the car with this coat he was grateful for the lack of bulk but glad for the warmth it provided. It fits great with a hoodie underneath. Seems to be good quality and fairly durable.",5
B07BN7D19Y,thought that we would love this to stay warm but the look is great and color is amazing but it is thinner than a sweatshirt. Wish it was just a little warmer,3
B07BN7D19Y,"I bought this jacket four years, four months ago.  I've worn it regularly in cool and cold weather, including winter. It is warmer than expected for such a lightweight jacket and is comfortable to wear. Today I notice an inch or so tear in the outer fabric or shell at the bottom of the jacket near the zipper. Not sure the cause, but otherwise the jacket has held up wear.  I think I will get a new one of the same type because the price is pretty reasonable.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"For a recent vacation to the mountains, I needed a new jacket that could fit into my suitcase.PROS: plenty warm down to 26F with a thermal undershirt and fleece worn under the jacket, borderline warm/cold with only a thermal undershirt worn under, lightweight, fits into a bag about as big as a hiking boot for easy packing, affordably priced, good value for the amount chargedCONS: not the most fashionable looking jacket (but what can you expect for this price?)I cannot rate the durability as I just bought this item and only wore it for one week in the cold.",4
B07BN7D19Y,Lightweight but warm.  Breathable and comfortable.  Fits well.  Enough room to wear a hoodie under and / or a rain shell over if needed.  Great for travel.,5
B07BN7D19Y,The best non-puffer jacket for me out of trying three others.Easy on and off. Justn the right weight and thickness.The hood hangs down inside the back so it won't get misplaced and is easy toput on or take off without having to contend with a zipper with cold fingers.This one is a keeper!,5
B07BN7D19Y,"Bought this for cool, not cold weather. It was great lightweight. Easy to layer. Good quality and fit.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"Excelente compra, es como se ve en la foto, recomendado 1 y mil veces",5
B07BN7D19Y,Providing one has a few Clothing Layers on I was surprised how well it held off the 25 degree Chills and Wind.Very light weight and comfortable too.,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I purchased two of these jackets as a lightweight backpackable jacket for our 12-day Philmon trek in the Sangre Cristo mountains of Northern New Mexico.  During our trek, we had 2.5 days of rain in altitudes over 9,000 feet.  The lowest temps were mid to high 40's, windy and wet!  These jackets did an outstanding job of keeping us both dry and warm.  In fact, during one particularly heavy rain, I discovered my old Army ACU wet weather top was in fact no longer waterproof.  I pulled off the top and this jacket which I had underneath my wet weather top was soaked in the front, back, and arms.  However that moisture/wetness never touched my skin.  This jacket also served as part of my pillow setup and in spite of the exterior being wet, and in the absence of NNM's low humidity, the jacket dried quickly, and I was able to use it as my pillow.  I would without hesitation recommend, and purchase these jackets again.  When I say ""Philmont Approved"", just know that means more than someone's opinion after taking it out of the package and posing in front of a mirror.  To recap the benefits:1)  Lightweight:  The jacket packs easily into the included bag and was attached to a carabiner on the outside of my backpack. It stayed secure through bushwhacking trails, hiking through trees that tried to grab everything, and scaling up and down some steep mountainsides.  My son kept his bag attached to the loop in the jacket and that worked very well for him.2)  Water resistant:  We both wore these during a few days of sprinkling rain and 2.5 days of legit rain- rain.  Water never breached the inside of the jacket and made contact with our skin.  That is a win!3)  Warm:  This jacket kept us warm in the very cool mountain air of Northern New Mexico, both dry and wet weather.  I'm not going to tell you that this jacket will keep you warm in freezing temps because we did not encounter that kind of weather.  But I will tell you that when it was in the mid  40's and my sleeping bag zipper was broken, and I was quite cold, I put this jacket on (and lost part of my pillow) but was warm and toasty!4)  Quality:  The zippers work great.  Zippered external pockets were a huge plus to reduce the chance of important things (like snacks or other small doodads that I used) from falling out and being lost.  The deep interior pockets were great for holding my phone (for pictures).  The only issue I had was that I tore the loop out.  It was dark and I was having a hard time getting the bag unknotted and broke the loop by force.  It wasn't a failure on the jacket - it was a failure on my patience!5)  Dries quickly:  After it got wet underneath my ""notta wet weather top"" it dried quickly and was able to fulfill it's purpose as part of my pillow setup.Summary:  This is a solid choice for a lightweight outer shell for cooler weather, and will work even if there is some rain in the forecast.  It is lightweight and breathable enough to work as a sub-layer if you have a lightweight rain jacket to help break the wind.  I did not notice the wind getting through this jacket, so I believe it serves well in that regard.  Also, if it survived my teenage Scout and all his rambunctious rock climbing and goofing around, then it should serve you well.  I purchased the Dark Olive Green because it's similar to the Ranger Green clothes I wear for Boy Scouts, and my son purchased the Light Brown because he likes that color.  Both colors look good.  The Light Brown is similar to Coyote Brown, but a little darker.  The OG version was also cheaper at the time of purchase.",5
B07BN7D19Y,Tela de buena calidad,5
B07BN7D19Y,A great jacket. Not for sub freezing weather but perfect for in between days.,5
B07BN7D19Y,"Slightly larger than expected. Looks good, deep pockets. Very warm. Excellent price in comparison to what I've had in the past.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"At first I was very disappointed , they have hardly any stuffing inside, it felt flat. Since I had already worn one I had ordered 4 debating to send all back  I decided to wash it and dry it with 3 Tennisballs in washer( of course no softener) and to my surprise they perfect now !!!I believe they treated with odd chemical and that makes them flat or so I just now , they work for me now ..They are wind resistant and actually warm . I wear it as 2nd layer and that works perfect .I wish it came with instructions how to roll them up to put in Back but I found some videos about it on you tube.The bag is a bit small but it workedMy temperature rating is 40F about if you wear it by itself . They do make great 2nd layer underneath another Jacket.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"Very happy with this jacket. Warm, but not bulky. Good color.. like burnt orange/rust. Sizing runs true.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"Great fit you will not have to order a size  up it runs big. 5xl 380 5""11",5
B07BN7D19Y,Great lightweight puffer jacket.  Perfect for a southeast winter!  My son loved it.,5
B07BN7D19Y,"Light weight, fits pretty well. But I'm 6'3"" and often need XL Tall. That's what I need in this jacket; but they don't offer it. Insulation is modest but I think we know that. This isn't a heavy duty down jacket. I think it will work OK for me. Inside pockets are a little weird. They are enormous, I don't know what you would put in there.",4
B07BN7D19Y,Exelente,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I was looking for an inexpensive but warm puffer jacket that wasn't made in China. This was it. It fits well, the quality seems ok to good, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. It is supposed to be water resistant (light precipitation) and warm enough for temperatures around freezing. It is NOT a heavy winter parka and you would need several layers of other outerware for that. But layering is a smart move anyway if you're into exercise and need to ""peel off"" a layer or two as you warm up. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",4
B07BN7D19Y,Great jacket,5
B07BN7D19Y,Nice,5
B07BN7D19Y,My Pop is a creature of habit and has had the same jacket for years. I got him a large he's about 6 foot 175 or so and he loves the warmth and how it is not heavy and he doesn't over heat in it. Great pockets outside and in. Stylish look. I couldn't find better for the price! Very pleased and he loves it!!!,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I actually like this jacket. Keep in mind that it is not designed for temperatures below freezing really but for the price and appearance, I recommend it. I would give it a 5-star rating if it had just a little more stuffing. I got the red one and it is very nice.",4
B07BN7D19Y,"Great item, smartly priced",5
B07BN7D19Y,"Warm, fits well, very affordable, and looks great!",5
B07BN7D19Y,"I needed something lightweight that I could stuff in a backpack and travel but I've never been a fan of the ""puffy"" coat. Yet something compelled me to make this purchase.Wow. It's incredibly light, comfortable, and insulates well. It's already becoming my go-to jacket for temperatures down to the low-to-mid forties.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"As good as the big brands for a fraction of the price! Very warm, very light, I love this jacket!",5
B07BN7D19Y,"They run a little small. I ware a size large, which was to small returned for an extra large, and the fit was perfect.",5
B07BN7D19Y,I love this product,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I read a review from a guy who said he was 6'6 tall, and he got a Large...I'm 5'10 and usually get a large... so when I read that I went with a Medium.The Medium arrived today and fits perfect. Sleeves are long enough, jacket too.Very warm. Good for the freezing weather that just came to north florida. It's 40 degrees outside and I'm warm with just a T-Shirt underneath. Let's see how it holds up in the rain.",5
B07BN7D19Y,Jacket fot my son well and was true to size. Puff in the coat isn't too big or bulky.,5
B07BN7D19Y,He loves the lite weight of it and fits great.,5
B07BN7D19Y,Feel comfortable,4
B07BN7D19Y,The quality is fantastic! I love that it is not super bulky. It was as good of feeling as a high end name brand puffer jacket.,5
B07BN7D19Y,For the price this is an awesome deal. The color was not exactly as the picture is like copper and turned out brown but I still liked it. Perfect fit on XS but I am usually S so it runs big.  Nice material overall. I will update the review after using it for a few weeks but so far happy with purchase and value.,5
B07BN7D19Y,This kept my boyfriend very warm during the winter but also extremely light so he could move around. It is also very soft,4
B07BN7D19Y,"Keeps me warm, its light-weight, affordable, and I use it daily.",5
B07BN7D19Y,I liked the fact that it is warm even though it's light. It's easy to put on and zip and it's very comfortable.,5
B07BN7D19Y,Bought it for my dad since he works outdoors. He loves its. Very light jacket and perfect for layering.,5
B07BN7D19Y,Personal great coat,5
B07BN7D19Y,As a really big guy I have a hard time finding jackets that fit and do the job of being warm and comfortable.  This works for all three plus it comes with a small stuff sack that the jacket surprisingly fits into.  Perfect for cold weather camping.  I just wore it out in 35 degree weather.  It blocked all the wind and I didn't feel my body temp change at all.  Feels like wearing snow pants and a coat.  I love it so far.,5
B07BN7D19Y,Great fit for the price,5
B07BN7D19Y,No branding is always a plus,4
B07BN7D19Y,Have enjoyed this coat!,5
B07BN7D19Y,Well made coat,5
B07BN7D19Y,Great jacket for the price !,5
B07BN7D19Y,Nice jacket.,5
B07BN7D19Y,Keeps you warm,5
B07BN7D19Y,"My son wears to school, and can put in his backpack when in class. He said it is warm and he loves it, and likes the fact that it can roll up tight and not take up much space in his backpack when he's inside.",5
B07BN7D19Y,It is nice jacket for the price.I like it.,5
B07BN7D19Y,The jacket actually looks like the picture and fits well too. Thanks .,5
B07BN7D19Y,One of the warmest things jackets iv ever worn. I recommend a size larger in XLT/big and tall to allow for layering.,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I purchased this jacket for someone who is at the growth point of somewhere between children's size and adult size.  I have purchased this same jacket in the largest child size and they really loved it.  This jacket fits a little oversized in the body for someone who is just under 5' tall and about 105 pounds; It gives room to grow.  The only issue I have, is that the sleeves are too long for someone of this size.  I wish Amazon made this jacket in one more size up on the children's side, or offered it in a men's XS.  These jackets feel really nice, keep you warm and wash/dry well.  They are a great Spring/Fall jacket.",4
B07BN7D19Y,"Very nice and useful jacket, good fit , timeless simple jacket at affordable price, i would definitely buy again a different color, highly recomended.",5
B07BN7D19Y,"Light weight , fits perfect and warm. I'm 6 ft. 195 lbs. The large is just right for me.",5
B07BN7D19Y,Nada que decir excelente producto,5
B07BN7D19Y,Perfect!,5
B07BN7D19Y,Perfect fit and light weight. Does the job .Will recommend others to buy,5
B07BN7D19Y,Excellent.  Thank you.,5
B07BN7D19Y,"I wear it over the top of my Patagonia Nano Puff vest ($$$!), and the bit of extra warmth it generates is perfect during winter when we try to keep the heat down inside the house. It's also fine for outside if the temp is above freezing and it's not pouring rain.",5
B07BN7D19Y,Great for the car and is light enough to allow you to move in the car but still warm enough to keep you warm but not overheated.,5
B07BN7D19Y,Gave it as a gift.Runs big.Medium was fine.,5
B07BN7D19Y,"You can't beat this for the price. I'm a big and tall guy and it fits be great. I recommend the 3xl tall. I'm 6 2"" and 330",5
B07BN7D19Y,"I have 3 things to tell you 1 how functional the jacket is, 2. The amazing use I got out of the jacket as a pack rat, 3. A story involving me, this jacket and a day trying to explore the Cape Cod in the cold.1. This jacket provided me with amazing warmth from 35f as a Floridan who has never seen snow and you'd expect to freeze over this jacket provided me amazing warmth from the cold climate and ocean breeze in the cold of winter.2. As a photographer it is sometimes cumbersome to carry all my equipment I need, but not only that often having it all in my camera bags makes it hard to switch to a needed accessory, or lens at a moments notice often making me not switch up my stuff while taking photos often, however this jacket has provided me with more pockets, zippers, compartments, ect than I could of ever dreamed of, one inner pocket for important items like a camera lens, cleaner, cap, ect the other inner pocket for a portable charger and with the help of long cords you can power any device around you, a little drawstring pouch for wallet,keys, ect, things you cant afford to lose and it tucks away on the inside of the jacket, then outter pockets beside to keep your hands warm, deep one being able to hold your phone your hand and so much more the other easy for keeping gloves and a beanie or other items that you may want to take on or off throughout your day. With the outer pockets with zippers so you can secure your things but even unzipped with how deep the pockets are good luck with anything falling out which leads me to my number 3.3. I throughout the day talking pictures and videos I fell on multiple occasions, 4 times to be exact, each one comedically getting funnier and more out of place, busting my butt, knees side anything to prevent me from falling on my camera gear, and often with normal jackets things may fall out of your pockets but for this jacket and every fall not once did I lose anything or have to worry about anything falling out. cementing in the fact I had to leave a review telling you the people how much I love this jacket.The one and only downside is that there is no hood to this jacket, hopefully amazon will make a new and improved version with a hood, for the mean time I just double layered a hooded shirt and kept a beanie with me which will work as well",5
B07BN7D19Y,"Absolutely love the jacket, but it did not come with a bag to put it in. That was the entire reason I got this jacket too.",3
B07BN7D19Y,Excelente producto lo que esperaba,5
B07BN7D19Y,"For less than $40, this jacket is a star.  The material and trims are good, the construction is good, the fit is good.  I also bought a fleece and a rain shell and all in spent about $120 -- about half the cost of an outdoor brand equivalent of this puffer -- for a layer system that will keep me warm AND dry.",5
B07BN7D19Y,Xl runs larger than expected,3
B07BN7D19Y,Not too hot but keeps you warm,5
B07BN7D19Y,"The coat is pretty warm, but the collar is really annoying. I could not get it to sit right.",3
B07BN7D19Y,I was very impressed with how warm it kept you,5
B07BN7D19Y,Excellent,5
B01HF4AL2A,"I've never owned GoldToe socks, but these have impressed me.  These socks are thicker and less expensive than the ones they are replacing.  They are also taller.  These socks go completely over my calves (I'm 6').  I read a review that said they were thin.  I'm not sure what they are comparing them to.  They are a great thickness and very warm.  They fit very well and are snug on my VERY SKINNY legs.  These would be very tight if you are.... erm.... more than average in size.  I am really surprised at the quality and comfort and very happy with my purchase.  I will update if there are any problems over time. I wear a size 9 men's shoe.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"Just finished my first day of wear. I spent a total of 10 hours in them and feel ready to write a review.For context, I'm 5'8"", 170. Somewhat athletic what a typical sized build. Meaning my legs and arms are not skinny nor large.These socks are very comfortable. I read reviews reading how people thought they were too thick. If you run hot, these socks might be too thick . For me, they were perfect. My feet did not sweat nor get cold. I found that they breathed just enough to allow me to not notice them. I liked how they stayed tight around my claves but were never bothersome. I mostly forgot they were there, which is what you want from a pair of socks.When I told the off, however, I  did have indentions on my claves from wearing them. this might be expected after wearing a non-slip sock for 10+ hours. If you are the slightest bit big orr have oversized calves, then I would suggest looking elsewhere for socks. I liked that they didn't fall at all. They also look really great.Overall, this sock will be great for some, and terrible for others. If you know your size and are either slightly smaller than average or below average I size, these socks will be gems. If you are average or above, you've been warned. These socks will not fit you well.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"I buy this brand often. We have a family member that is on concrete 15 hrs a day weather he's wearing trainers or work boots he wears Gold Toe and he says its the most comfortable sock out there. Believe me he's tried them all. These are NOT winter socks. They are just the regular every day sock and they last a long time as long as the sock monster in the dryer doesn't eat them. There are never any loose threads, loose elastic or problems with the seams. In fact, the elastic lasts longer than the actual sock every time so you don't have to worry about them slipping down into your shoe or gathering around your ankle. The colours have never bled (I buy white and coloured) and the whites have never yellowed. Socks on his big hoof for 15 hrs a day so he's had his fair share of blowouts and that is to be expected considering they are socks. At this price point its worth it to buy quality socks.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"These are really nice socks if you're looking for a plain old white crew sock. They're cushy and feel like they'll last a while, and they fit well (mostly). They're also pretty cheap in comparison to a lot of other comparable socks. In comparison to Hanes or whatever multipack is cheapest, these are easily worth the extra ~$4 to upgrade.The main problem I have with them is how long they are. I wear a size 12 shoe and bought the XL just to be safe, and they go like 3/4 up my entire calf. It's crazy! Besides that, they're comfortable and thick, but not too thick like a wool sock.",4
B01HF4AL2A,"I was sad when after the first time wearing these high quality socks, the pairs were too tight on my calves. I am a small guy too. I gave them to a neighbor who has thin calves the size of my wrist. These are high quality,thick and beautiful socks. I bought a brown pair of the same socks in the late 1980s and still look new today. I know they will last a long time. I wish the tops of the socks would not cut off circulation. Gold Toe has made top notch products. I won't give up and find pairs I can use.I gave them 5 stars because of the quality. I didn't want to leave less stars because they didnt work for me. That wouldn't be fair to other buyers.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"Overall, nice socks. Quality of Goldtoe is pretty darn good. Try to avoid discounted socks from discounted online sellers. These do the job; they are not small and of low quality, rather the XL are of good size. I am size 12 wide and the length up the calf are just right and are not tight when putting on my feet. During the last week or two the price is also nice for 6 pairs, not 6 socks. Good socks for winter as well. Soft and warm.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"These are the best socks for retaining their fit, and last a long time. Best value for functionality, comfort, look and stretchiness.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"This mixed package has mixed a mixed review. Some Sox are good, some are really tight around the calf and others are too thick- heavy.  Not at all what I wanted.  I am sharing w/ Good Will.",3
B01HF4AL2A,I was looking for some 100% cotton ateast close too socks!! So spending a little more and saying we'll they gotta be better.....and they are They're thick warm and very cushioning for boots that made bother you all day.so good thing I got this out the way and I bought 2 sets so I know they'll last 1yr plus.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Overall good. Toes wear out over time. A little tight in the calf,4
B01HF4AL2A,The comfort with these socks is surprising. I've had Gold Toe dress sock s but never crew socks and to top it off the size is from 12 and up. I wear a 13 shoe and these fit perfect. The cotton and poly is a good combination. I recommend them.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Socks fit well they stay up nicely without being too tight on my calves.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"I ordered two packs of these socks at the same time. One pack is about one half inch higher on the calf than the other. Very strange. Same day, same brand, ostensibly the same socks. Other than that, they are great.",4
B01HF4AL2A,Nice dark socks. Washed well.,5
B01HF4AL2A,These socks will completely cover your calf and do not slip.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Just what you would expect from GoldToe. Good quality. Nice variety of colors and hopefully like others I've had in the past. Long wearing.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Warm and comfortable for the winter season. My husband loves them.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"Reasonable socks, though kind of thin--neither uncomfortable nor particularly comfortable",4
B01HF4AL2A,"These socks are good quality but too thick. If hosiery dress socks are 1/10 and heavyweight socks are 10/10, these come in around 6-7. I was looking for about 3-4/10 to wear in dress shoes, boots, and sneakers but these are too thick and, therefore, too hot. Will probably have to shop brick and mortar to be able to get the thickness I am needing.",4
B01HF4AL2A,"I was expecting the Goldtoe regular crew socks that I have used for years.  Those rise about 11"" from the floor when standing up, but I like these better.  On me, these rise around 14""-15"" from the floor, for more complete calf coverage, and somehow that seems more comfortable.",5
B01HF4AL2A,Husband very pleased with quality and proper sizing,5
B01HF4AL2A,This sock is the perfect thickness to wear boots. The collections comes with a nice variety of colors.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Good Socks! 1 pack latest me 8 months of everyday usage. Well worth it imo,4
B01HF4AL2A,Comfortable,5
B01HF4AL2A,Got these for my husband for Christmas. He is very particular about his socks. He was very happy. Says they are comfortable and absorb moisture well. They stay up and function as expected. They are light weight and seem to hold up well in the wash.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"Toe clamps, size runs small.",4
B01HF4AL2A,"comfortable ,warm and look good!",5
B01HF4AL2A,Exactly the way I want my socks to fit.,4
B01HF4AL2A,These fit nicely. The cushioned footbed is comfy & they are not too tight @ the top.,4
B01HF4AL2A,"4 out of 6 pairs were great! They stay up, are warm enough, and are not stretching out. The black ones, however, after well over a month of wearing and washing, leave long trails of...material? It's not lint, it's not threads or strings...just thick black worm-looking things that stick to everything they come in contact with: clothes in the dryer, carpet, shoes.  I'm afraid I will lose one of them, and find the entire shredded sock in the lint tray! :-0 The colored ones are not at all like that. So, if you can, stick to the non-black varieties!",3
B01HF4AL2A,"Goldtoe Harrington crew socks cover the foot, ankle and calf with a warm fabric which conforms nicely to my actual shape, stays up high on the calf due to a little spandex sewn in, yet can be easily taken off.  At a ridiculously low cost of about $2/pair they are an incredible bargain now from Amazon.",5
B01HF4AL2A,I like them but they don't last long. I have had these for awhile I think I bought 2 packs because they fit good I like them long. I will say they last about a year I am on my 3rd pack so far they are getting holes in the heel I thought it was my shoes but it's the sock. It happens in bunches so its the first pack I have bought are gone So I either buy another pack or try another brand.,4
B01HF4AL2A,I love this brand's quality.  Socks are very comfortable but quite thick if you are wearing dress shoes,4
B01HF4AL2A,What can I say. They fit good and feel great.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Goldtoe socks last the longest for me (I wear out the toes). However I assumed they were crew socks. I will keep them becaue they were a good deal.,4
B01HF4AL2A,The only thing was I didnt want over the calf which I let them know but they sent them anyway,5
B01HF4AL2A,They feel thinner and tighter but are my favorite socks,4
B01HF4AL2A,"I like that these socks are mostly cotton. They're cooler to wear and more comfortable on my feet. However, Gold Toe needs to sell their socks and individual colors instead of multicolor packages. I prefer to buy the colors I want and not stuck with colors I don't want just to get a few pairs of colors I do want.",3
B01HF4AL2A,I wear 10.5 shoes and these are a little snug,4
B01HF4AL2A,"Thick, comfortable, and long!",5
B01HF4AL2A,"They are great, very light weight, true size, moisture retention.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"I had older gold toe socks I was trying to replace and these aren't the same (I suspect my older socks didn't have spandex in them) but these are fine for my everyday wear with leather shoes.  They're slightly thicker than many other dress socks, and I like that.",4
B01HF4AL2A,Soft and fluffy. Stay up even on my fat calfs,5
B01HF4AL2A,"I am a Gold Toe fan!  Recently I decided to switch from Hanes white athletic socks to Gold Toe black crew socks. I stocked up and wear them every day.  However, I needed them in a different color-specifically brown. I saw these and while not all the colors were what I wanted I decided to try them.  To my surprise, these are nothing like the black crew socks I wear every day (not the same pair).  These should be described as ""over the calf"" socks. They are not soft and bulky like my black ones.  They have enough elastic to serve as support hose from top to bottom.  I just roll the tops down and go with it.  Don't get me wrong.  These are quality socks.  I will keep them and wear them. But just be aware that these are NOT crew socks.",3
B01HF4AL2A,Nice heavy weight socks in nice variety of brown colors.  Just what I was looking for.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"Hubby likes the gold toe brand and we bought the largest size they had for him, but it felt too small and a bit snug for him to wear.",4
B01HF4AL2A,These are heavy socks. We only wear them in the winter. They've lasted a long time for my husband.,4
B01HF4AL2A,listed on package and website as for shoe size 12-16 but I am a 14 and could barely get them on. After washing and drying I will probably have to give away to someone with smaller feet.,4
B01HF4AL2A,"Good quality, great price",5
B01HF4AL2A,"Being 80 yo with bad knees, the over-the-calf provides additional warmth and comfort.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"These fit well, are warm,  and look good.Goldtoe socks are the only brand I wear",5
B01HF4AL2A,"These are my two teenage boys favorite white socks. Stay up, not too thick and great quality.",5
B01HF4AL2A,Very comfortable and cushy. Would buy again.,5
B01HF4AL2A,The socks are comfortable. His feet don't get overheated.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"These Gold Toe socks are really comfortable.  I have a set of black ones I picked up a few years ago, and appreciated the padded thickness feel of them.  I saw these on Prime Day, and decided to replace my old white socks with these, and am very happy with that decision.  They are just as comfortable as the black ones I'd gotten years ago.  They have plenty of elastic to stay up.  I expect them to last a while.",5
B01HF4AL2A,These socks are well made and comfortable.,4
B01HF4AL2A,Very good quality!,5
B01HF4AL2A,"These are well-made, nice, solid socks. More solid than Gold Toe's shorter lighter socks that I also wear.They're almost winter socks, but can be worn in other seasons as long as it's not too hot & humid.They're pretty thick, so if your shoes are already a little tight, these will be tighter.I personally have issues with both, which I don't suppose most other wearers would have, because my feet are size 13, wide, and my lower legs are fairly wide. For me, the smaller sock ride down, and these, which are much thicker and warmer, don't ride down as much, but they are so tight on me that they start cutting off my circulation. I didn't mark the stars down for that, since I think I'm just personally between sizes.",4
B01HF4AL2A,thick and durable. exactly what I needed.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"These socks came exactly as expected, color and style and all that. They are very soft and comfortable, in the foot. If you have very thin calves, and are light of step, you will probably like these socks.The part above the ankle is very tight on me. I am comparing the fit on these to the last few orders of Gold Toe socks I've had. I am using the same feet and legs that I use to wear my other Gold Toe socks, and those socks do not bind my legs in this way. These actually leave marks in my skin.My second issue is that the socks are so soft, they are pilling with their first wearing. As before, same feet & legs and have had those other socks at least 4 years. They never did pill up, at all. I still have some of these other socks. They show less pilling after 4 years than these show after one wearing. However, I reiterate, the foot sacks of these socks are aggressively soft. Pajama soft.Anyway, you might fairly ask me, why then did you not simply order more of those other socks? The ones of which you are so clearly enamored, despite having worn them until the elastic simply had not the strength to continue on, despite the enduring quality of the materials and wholly satisfactory softness? Well. I am unable to locate those specific socks to purchase. I would have, were that clearly available to me.But THESE socks simply do not meet my specific expectations, which were set by other Gold Toe products I have found satisfactory or even exemplary. In the past, where we cannot live. The only reason I didn't return these after trying them on is that I'm reasonably certain they would get discarded outright, and I can't claim these socks are unwearable. They will fit some people, excellently, even. Just not me.And yeah it is totally possible I'm too dumb to buy socks on the internet, but ... Actually? Let's leave it right there. YMMV YOLO ETC",2
B01HF4AL2A,Have used these socks for years. Love mostly cotton.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"There is really nothing to dislike about these socks. I do like the slight padding on the underside of my feet.I also like the fact that they are thick and warm. The also do not leave marks on my  legs when I take them off, meaning they are not too tight. If I wore them with shoes they might be too thick, but I wear them to bed and for that they are perfect and prevent me from getting cramps during the  night.  Also you get6 PAIRS for a great price.  Give them a try if you want good bed socks. Thank you Amazon for selling asuch a good product.  P.S.  I am a woman of 5'7"" and these socks come way over my calves. almost to myknees.  Just wonderful.UPDATE;  This is the second set of these socks which I have bought, this time for my husband.  The same great things apply, except that he wears them under his sweatpants and I wear them  as bedsocks.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"Like the socks for me, but got them for my big and tall son who has wide calves. These don't stretch out enough and feel way too tight for him. They work wellon average size calves.",3
B01HF4AL2A,"Good socks, fit is great, soft yet supportive. I am glad the tube top stripes are not seen when I sit down, the look would make me feel like I was 12 again.  I like the colors, I needed socks that had a better match to my part color and not just wearing white socks with everything.  I hope they hold up to washing, I think they will since they feel well made.",5
B01HF4AL2A,ran small even though went by sizing chart...Husband gave them to me,3
B01HF4AL2A,My son loves them,4
B01HF4AL2A,This brand has excellent quality and we would buy again.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"These are thin ""hose"" type dress socks. They're very thick and heavy and come way up the calf. No falling down to your ankle. You'll love them in wintertime, but maybe not in August.",4
B01HF4AL2A,Bought these for my son-in-law for Christmas.  He will wear nothing but Gold Toe socks and that's all I buy him.  I wear the women's Gold Toe's as well because they are comfortable and last wash after wash.  I would definitely recommend them.,5
B01HF4AL2A,They are well made socks - good quality but they are a little snug for X-Large. I'm a 12 3E and while they are comfortable on - it takes a little tugging. Order them a little bigger than you think you need.,4
B01HF4AL2A,"My husband has size 13 shoes so got these extended size. They fit nice and look like they will hold up well for years. Hes hard on socks but the extended size helps with that. So far, they wash well and seem durable.",5
B01HF4AL2A,"I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing, but I've worn Gold Toe socks for years and been happy with them.  These are NOT CREW SOCKS!  They're ""over the calf.""  I'll keep them, because I sometimes like having that length of sock; but this is really disappointing.  I now have to buy another set of socks.",3
B01HF4AL2A,"I've been buying Cotton Fluffies from Gold Toe for literally forever.  Unfortunately the new Gold Toe Fluffies as made with a different blend of materials and not what they used to be.  I bought these Harrington Crew socks from Gold Toe that are mostly cotton with the right amount of spandex and band around the end of the sock to hold/not sag/not slip down off my calf after wearing them for the entire day.  The sole of the sock is definitely thicker and cushioned which is great for all-day comfort on your feet.  While not compression socks, they definitely hold on my lower leg and the largest size stretches above my calf.  I've 6'2"" and take a 34-inch pant leg with thinner muscular calves.  I do not feel these socks are too tight but rather just right.  If I had a huge calf muscle, I don't know if they'd be as comfortable.  These are now my new standard sock for life from Gold Toe.  They come in a variety of colors that all are made and fit the same.  The multipack is a good value and they seem to be wearing very well after many wearings and washes.  Buy with confidence!",5
B01HF4AL2A,If you have large calf muscles do not buy this sock it'll be too tight. The overall quality of the stock is top-notch it's one of the nicest pairs of socks I purchased in a long time the only problem is I have huge calves so I literally had to cut the sock and make it like it ankle sock in order to wear it.,4
B01HF4AL2A,"These are thick socks. If that is what you want, these are great. I doubt I will wear them in warmer months. But for Fall and Winter, these should be nice.Just an update: These socks are still great!",5
B01HF4AL2A,My husband loves these. I buy a pack for him every Christmas. They are the most durable socks we have ever found. And at a great price. Definitely recommend.,5
B01HF4AL2A,The dark blue pair of socks had holes in both ball of the foot after a few washings. The rest of the pairs of socks were ok so far.,3
B01HF4AL2A,"Its REALLY tight around the calf. Its like the same size through out the sock. It expands but at the same time, it doesnt. Its not for people with thick calfs",3
B01HF4AL2A,great deals unexpected shipping fee - who has time to read the fine print. like the socks perfect 9 out of 10.,3
B01HF4AL2A,"These are nice socks, and they are comfy for sure. My only gripe is that they are very long--probably because the set is intended to cover several shoe sizes. These reach almost up to my knees (and I'm 5' 11"", and wear a size 10.5 shoe). That's too long, I think. I like them, but I can't wear them in warm weather because they are simply too much sock. Otherwise, the material and knitting is good quality.",4
B01HF4AL2A,"sock looks nice , only to thick for me , i like thinner",3
B01HF4AL2A,These socks are super comfortable and nice.So easy to match socks with the gold toe.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"I have worn white gold toe socks since the mid 1960's and have never been disappointed.  So I thought I'd be a little sporty and try the colored variety, and I really like them.But I must tell you that they feel very thick in your hand, but they are quite stretchy, so not quite as thick once on your feet.  Also, because of the stretchiness, they come up to at least mid-calf, and I am 6'1"".One curious note. . . not all 6 pairs are the same blend of fibers, so some are naturally more stretchy than the others.",5
B01HF4AL2A,I wear these in the colder Minnesota months. They work perfectly. Thanks.,5
B01HF4AL2A,Love These. So far so good. Fun selection of colors...if you aren't a monochrome type of person. And they stay up on your calf.,5
B01HF4AL2A,"Not great for wearing with dressy outfits. Thick, better for casual wear.",3
B01HF4AL2A,"Goldtoe has been my favorite brand of socks for a long time probably at least 15 years, but maybe I need to change. It seems they don't want to make natural-fiber dress socks from cotton or rayon anymore; whether I shop online or at a mall, I can no longer find the lightweight, smooth, rayon dress socks i loved, and all their dress socks now seem to be a blend of plastic (nylon, polyester) and cotton, and usually a much higher percentage of plastic.I tried these out, and they seem more durable than the rayon or cotton dress socks GT used to make, but they're also not nearly as comfortable. They're really thick and tight, to the point where it takes extra effort to put them on in the morning. I'm finding that when it's getting near time to do laundry, these are usually the last clean pairs i have because I'm subconsciously rejecting them when i sleepily reach for clean socks while i'm getting dressed. They're really warm, which might be perfect if you live in a colder area (who does anymore, what with the global warming?), but I live in Texas which tends to be hot 9 months out of the year, and since plastic fiber clothing doesn't breathe as well, my feet get uncomfortably warm and sweaty wearing these. They also produce a lot of lint on the inside, which will stick between and around your toes, get on your floors, and in your shower/bathtub. Won't be buying these again.",2
B01HF4AL2A,bought for 17 years old and they have held up really well,5
B01HF4AL2A,"These socks are elegant and very comfortable. They keep the feet warm and cozy. Nevertheless, I worried that, after the first wash, they seem to being deteriorating quite fast. Not the color, but the fabric, around the heels.",3
B01HF4AL2A,Would have been nice if the site listed these as knee socks.,4
B01HF4AL2A,My husband loves this brand!,5
B01HF4AL2A,can not find scokes like this in the stores,5
B01HF4AL2A,This is a quality product but they run small!  The light blue sox wont be useful for most men.,3
B01HF4AL2A,I have been wearing gold toe for years. This package seems to fit really tight!,4
B01HF4AL2A,"I ordered the 6 Multipair ""Duffle Bag"" assorted colors for this sock. From the photos and description, I was hoping that these would be a little more like hiking socks. The photos give the impression of a rustic rag-like sock. But in person, the material is lighter weight similar to a standard casual sock. They offer very little cushion and look a little skimpy. The large size runs a bit small and only comes a little past my lower ankle. The foot bed is probably ok for someone who wears a size 6-10 shoe, but not much larger. The colors are ok, but two of the pairs look better in the photos. The green and brown pairs have odd hues that are not that appealing. I was hoping for better from Goldtoe.  Overall, I would have returned these, but I missed the return date over the summer holiday.",3
B01HF4AL2A,The socks were packaged in what can only be described as a thin plastic film produce bag.  They were literally falling out of the bag.  The socks are great and fortunately didn't get damaged.  The soles are a little thicker and the ankle is stretchy.  You can pull them up quite high.  I'd buy them again.,4
B0015VHIF8,They are so comfortable and they stay put.,5
B0015VHIF8,"Super comfy, breathable, cushion in the right places but not bulky socks. I have several pairs. I wash and dry them normal, they hold up perfect",5
B0015VHIF8,"These socks are cushioned in the toes and heels, come in a variety of colors, unisex, moisture wicking and great fit. I highly recommend them.",5
B0015VHIF8,I've always loved this brand. Cannot beat the comfort. Perfect fit every time!,5
B0015VHIF8,"My feet blister very easily and it is one of the things that holds me back from long walks and going on walking adventures.  Last month I was going to Disneyland for the day and planning on being there from opening to closing.  The one thing I dreaded was knowing I would develop painful blisters within the first few hours.  I researched these socks and decided to give them a shot.  I GOT ZERO BLISTERS!  At the end of the night I could tell one spot was close to blistering, but it never developed.  These socks are magic!  I loved them so much that I purchased more colors.  If your feet blister, BUY THESE SOCKS!!!",5
B0015VHIF8,Most comfortable socks around,5
B0015VHIF8,"Super comfy, would definitely order more. Walked around a ton in these while on a trip and they held up so well with no blisters.",5
B0015VHIF8,"I absolutely love these socks.  I use them for walking, hiking and playing pickleball.  Just wish they weren't so dang expensive.  I now own 3 pairs, two which I purchased several years ago.  They do last a long time, although my original 2 pairs are getting real grungy looking.  Maybe I'll buy another pair next year...",5
B0015VHIF8,At last. I finally got a decent pair of socks. I ordered 1 pair and loved it so I spent more money and bought 5 more pair of socks.,5
B0015VHIF8,"Best low cut socks for running. Light weight; no rub spots, durable. Never had them slip down during a run. (They do slip some if worn with casual shoes that are not tied).",5
B0015VHIF8,"Back around 2016-2017, I unearthed a pair of socks waaaaay in the rear of my sock drawer that I didn't recognize. They were Balega. I asked every family member ""Are these yours?"" thinking they'd landed in my sock drawer by mistake. To this day, I don't know where they came from. Anyway, I put them on and the skies parted and angels sang. Oh. My. Gawd. I didn't know socks could make such a difference!? I'm not a runner or an athlete, but I do walk around a big theme park in Anaheim in Converse All Stars a few times per month. I'm fat and in my fifties. My feet hurt pretty easily. BUT these Balegas made all the difference! I was stunned at how much more endurance I had because I wasn't wearing cheapie ped socks from the discount store. I loved Balegas. So much I wouldn't shut up about them. I gave them to everyone on their birthdays (with the caveat ""I know i'm giving you socks on your birthday, but just wait till you try them!"") I was like a walking Balega billboard. Then. It happened. I think Balega outsourced or changed manufacturers because they DO NOT HAVE ANY STAYING POWER (as they once did). I wash and dry my new socks the same way I used to launder my previous Balegas, but now they stretch out and stay stretched out. They no longer retain their shape which is a huge part of their comfort factor. At nearly twenty bucks a pair, this is unacceptable. They should **not** be losing their integrity after only a few washings -- particularly since I'm merely wearing them to do daily tasks -- not marathoning. Sadly, I think it's time to seek out an alternative to Balega. :(",3
B0015VHIF8,Great running socks! Has a awesome amount of cushion and ankle protection. I will buy more and strongly recommend. I don't know if slave labor was involved in the manufacturing of this product.,5
B0015VHIF8,Love these,5
B0015VHIF8,I own at least 10 pairs of Balega socks. I will not buy them from here again as I found them at TJ Maxx and Marshall's for $5.99.,5
B0015VHIF8,Excellent thick socks! Give great support for sore feet,5
B0015VHIF8,These were a little bulky around the toes.  I have many pairs and this model didn't fit as well.,4
B0015VHIF8,I can't believe how comfortable they are.  I've ordered several pair and this is my go to sock,5
B0015VHIF8,These are so comfortable. Light on top with a good cushion on bottom. They are my absolute favorite running sock. They are very soft and have thick soles to makes sure your foot is cuddled perfectly. The back heel has a lip to protect from blisters.,5
B0015VHIF8,My favorite socks! Love this brand.,5
B0015VHIF8,"They are very comfortable, did not slip down into my shoes & kept my feet cool in the desert heat",5
B0015VHIF8,"These fit well, are high quality, and I find myself digging around in the sock drawer to find them because they are pretty much the only ones I want to wear. My daughter, who hikes a lot, and is super picky about her gear, was mad that I hadn't told her about these socks earlier.",5
B0015VHIF8,"These are great socks if you have peripheral nerve damage. They are thick and soft so your feet don't get so irritated during the day, making it easier to sleep at night.",5
B0015VHIF8,My mom loves these socks for running and she needed another white pair. It was the perfect little gift for her. Definitely recommend as I like these socks too!,5
B0015VHIF8,"Love these socks, size down if ordering for women, at least with the most recent order they were unisex so a size medium was quite big and small would have been better for the person wearing them who wears the equivalent of women's medium (men's small).",4
B0015VHIF8,I love Balega running socks and decided to order some to wear with my AF1s and Nike Dunks. They are comfortable and the heel grip helps them stay in place. Best socks ever.,5
B0015VHIF8,"I am an overweight woman, so I am harder on my feet, shoes, and socks than most people. I exercise most days of the week, and I mostly use the treadmill and elliptical. With the treadmill, I ALWAYS have hot spots on the bottoms of my feet and that just makes me want to quit sooner than I should. They HURT! I decided to do some research on shoes and socks that were supportive and comfortable...and for ME they have to be DURABLE. That's when I found Balega. I read the reviews and finally decided to pay crazy money (or so I thought at the time) for a SINGLE PAIR of socks! ""UNHEARD OF"" I thought. But...you usually get what you pay for...so I decided to see if these were as exceptional as they seemed. AND THEY ARE. OH MY GOSH. They are THE BEST PAIR OF SOCKS I HAVE EVER HAD. They are soft, comfortable, supportive, cushiony (I know that's not a word, but let's pretend it is) on the bottom and in the back (no blisters!) and they let your feet BREATHE. I no longer get hot spots! And in fact, my feet felt SO GREAT the first time I wore them, that I ACTUALLY RAN ON THE TREADMILL! That's something I've never felt comfortable doing. So not only do these help my feet feel great while exercising, but they are ACTUALLY going to help me reach my goals faster by allowing me to do more in my exercise! What could be better?? Nothing as far as I'm concerned. :) Thanks Balega!",5
B0015VHIF8,I am a repeat buyer of these socks.  The thickness adds comfort.  My only complaint is that the price is high,4
B0015VHIF8,Very comfortable,5
B0015VHIF8,"The main add says these are for men and women.  It does not equate the S-M-L, etc. to shoe size.  I ordered a M.  They are too big.  When I received the product, the cardboard case showed a nice scaled reference indicating that I should have purchased a Small.  It was my mistake, I should not have purchased them without investigating further so I will not return them. I strongly suggest that the ad show an image of sizing like that on the packaging.  Problem solved!  Otherwise, they are nice, soft and comfortable... probably would have rated a 4 or 5 star.",3
B0015VHIF8,"These are my favorite socks since they are so comfortable. I also have Bombas,which I like as well, but feel these are even more comfortable/soft. Find these are always the pair I am reaching for over others in my sock drawer.  So far have held up really well as well.  Would highly recommend!",5
B0015VHIF8,Worth every penny.,5
B0015VHIF8,"I've been wearing these for years. They are durable, strong, soft and last for years.. including machine wash n dry.  I recently tried on some regular/basic socks (bc the belgas needing washing) and oh boy I felt the difference in about 10 minutes into my outdoor walk. My feet felt raw and blistered in those generic socks. Hence when these are on sale, I try to buy several.....no eating out for week (considering how expensive they are, you won't worry about missing socks bc you'll keep up with these).",5
B0015VHIF8,"I have been trying different brands of fitness socks for many years, and these are worth the price. They have a soft cushiony feel under my feet, and most important for me they do not bind tightly around my ankles. After washing, I air dry them so they are not damaged from the heat of the dryer. I plan to purchase a few more pairs!",5
B0015VHIF8,"These are first pair of running socks. Wasn't sure which ones to buy so based it on Amazon reviews and am glad I did. I don't actually run yet, but do a lot of brisk walking with brief jogging since I need to get into shape before actually attempting to run. I Paired these with Saucony running shoes and the shin splints and soreness in my feet are gone.I am a true size 8.5 Women's and these fit perfectly- the heel is where the heel is supposed to be so there is no bunching inside the shoe. I did buy a size 9 shoe (also online) and the padding from these socks help them to fit perfectly, although I can easily wear these with a pair of my regular sports shoes (size 8.5).The padded roll is wonderful so the shoe doesn't rub your skin above the heel. And they are breathable on top so your feet don't feel like they are suffocating.I'm ordering two more pair. They arrived very well packaged and on time.",5
B0015VHIF8,"There are few things I really want for Christmas, but these are always on my list. I have at least a dozen pairs. I have given them as gifts. They are super soft, have excellent cushion, and they last a long time.  The tab at the back seemed a little gimmicky to me at first, but now I understand why it's there, and it works. The tab doesn't really show. I own these in white and black. I felt so strongly I actually emailed the company to tell them how much I love these. They replied with a very nice email, thanking me for their support.  I would never have thought, out of all the tech gadgets and other stuff that I have, that I would write a company or a review, about SOCKS.  You owe it to yourself to spend ten bucks on a pair of socks, and see what I mean.  If you couldn't care less, you're probably not reading sock reviews in the first place.  These come HIGHLY recommended.",5
B0015VHIF8,"Balega has made me a sock snob!  Only sock I wear unless dressed for work.  I started running in Balegas a few years back.  I was running 50+ miles a week in them at one point.  Now it's the only sock I will run in, hike in, backpack in, chill in.  They hold up nice as well, still wear some I purchase 2 years back but buy a few pairs each year.  I love backpacking and have tried expensive hiking socks but they just don't work.  Fellow backpackers get blisters but I have never while wearing my Balega socks.  Buy some, they will change your life!",5
B0015VHIF8,I use these for running and for work. I stand all day at a hospital and they are the most comfortable socks I own. About to buy a few more!,5
B0015VHIF8,These are the best socks that I have ever worn. The seams are perfectly smooth. They are a medium thickness with cushioning.  They wash up well without losing their size. I love all of the colors that they come in.,5
B0015VHIF8,"These socks provide soft comfort to all your toes and gentle effective cushioning for your soles without the bulk of many sock brands.  In addition, the Hidden Comfort remains after washing. Remarkable relief!",5
B0015VHIF8,Very durable. The only brand that I buy.,5
B0015VHIF8,I subscribe to these socks because I love them so much.,5
B0015VHIF8,"I've been buying Balega socks for over five years now.  They are so cushy and soft that I had to ban my fiance from wearing them (I very kindly bought him some pairs of his own so I am not a total non-sharing jerk).I absolutely recommend these socks for workouts, long runs, or just kicking it around the house.  There is a little lip at the back of the sock that niftily fits over the heel of my running shoes, trainers, sneakers...whatever you prefer to call your kicks.Balegas are a little pricey but oh so worth it as they last for a long, long time.Lots of Amazon Love,Laurie",5
B0015VHIF8,These things are so comfy. I want to buy more.,5
B0015VHIF8,"When my friend said buy these Socks. I was like why do I have to spend so much on a plain sock? Sound so ridiculous but I went ahead and I ordered one. It really helped me on my first ever Marathon. I wondered how I would have felt without them.Oh my God! They are the best pair of socks I will ever own. That I had to asked myself, where has the socks been all my Running life..  Lol.I'm always on my feet, very active and I workout 5-7 times a week, These are just perfect. Breathable, well cushion, soft and smooth. I don't just wear it for running only, I wear it to work and casual too. I will definitely order more.",5
B0015VHIF8,"these are very comfy socks. BUT THEY RUN BIG.  i ordered a size Medium based on the sizing guidelines.  I wear a size 7.5 shoe.  wow, i was still able to pull about 2 inches of extra sock from the tip of my toes after i put them on.  next time i will get a size Small if i order these again.  Im still able to wear them ok, but they are pretty roomy, too roomy for me.  They are good quality and thicker then my Adidas socks.",4
B0015VHIF8,"I have been wearing these socks for well over 3 years, I'm not a runner but love to hike and walk for long distances. I don't know why but when I put these socks on I feel like I could be on my feet for days.They are a perfect gift for me when my children ask what I want for my birthday.I am a sock weirdo...I love a good fitting sock.They last forever and feel as soft and comfortable after every washing, they last forever.They are expensive but worth every dime. The only reason I buy new ones is because I think my daughter is stealing them from me or they get lost in the laundry...and they do get dirty after several years of wear.I don't find them hot as other people have said but I don't get over heated often.Try them you won't be unhappy.",5
B0015VHIF8,They are great work out socks... just a bit pricey but I like them for Pickleball,5
B0015VHIF8,"I was the idiot and bought one pair of socks for $16. I was too quick to buy socks. I don't get it. There is nothing special about these socks, and after two washes, I can tell they will not hold up well.",3
B0015VHIF8,"I walk for my exercise, and most of the little socks that stop at your ankle ride down on my heel and end up chapping my foot.  These socks are great for people who have narrow heels because they really grip your foot unlike any other brand of sock I have ever worn.  I got my first pair at a running shoe store and it was the best tip I ever got.",5
B0015VHIF8,"Fit was too loose and thickness was not what I was hoping for. Also, supportive properties were disappointing.  My husband is wearing them to the gym so they won't be unused.",2
B0015VHIF8,"Update: I did an exchange for new socks, and the new pairs both had much better and normal toe seams. The length was still longer than my previous items, not quite as elastic I would say, but worked good enough for me to keep. I will see how they wash, maybe that is the difference, but I think my originals were just bad quality control. I do love these socks. Too bad that maybe the quality is dropping.Previous: I wear these socks all the time. I love the way they look and feel under my shoes. But these 2 pairs of white, I just bought are not right. They are a lot longer than the 20 previous pairs I have. The toe seem is not flat and tucked at the end. It is on the outside and points out on the side creating a bump between shoe and toe. Not good quality from a company I usually trust.  The bottom/longer is the new sock and the sock on top is a previous sock I own. Just missed the quality check. I bought a grey pair at same time and it is great, Like normal.",1
B0015VHIF8,"These fit as expected. They are super comfortable and they have not shrunk in the wash. They best part, too, is that they don't slip down into your shoes! Highly recommend them.",5
B0015VHIF8,"These socks are advertised as thick, cushiony and that they don't slip down your heel into the shoe.  I gave two stars because they are thick and comfortable.  However, they slip constantly.  Had to stop twice on a walk today to adjust them.  Finally just gave up and limped.  Would not buy again and would not recommend!",2
B0015VHIF8,Extremely comfortable. Very high quality. I will be ordering more. These socks are fitted without being tight or restricted in anyway.,5
B0015VHIF8,Best Socks I've ever had.Most cushy and comfortable,5
B0015VHIF8,"Great fit 61/2 Wide! Cushy, moisture wicking, came quickly!",5
B0015VHIF8,My dad has a really skinny heel and has had the hardest time finding no-show socks that will stay put and not slip down into his shoe. I finally convinced him to try Balega as I love them for running. He really likes the fit and thinks they are a winner! Will save him from the geeky over the ankle socks he has been wearing with his Sperry's for years!,5
B0015VHIF8,Most comfortable socks I own!  Extra padding where you need it.  Low cut is a plus!  Washes well and maintains its fit!,5
B0015VHIF8,Soft and protect your heels!!,5
B0015VHIF8,I've been purchasing this exact sock for over a decade of running and have never found a reason to switch.  They're extremely comfortable to run in for distances short & long.  Obviously you pay a bit more for a sock like this but they last for a long time and are worth it in my opinion.,5
B0015VHIF8,Bought both the purple socks (Made in South Africa) and the white socks (Made in Turkey). Two separate Amazon orders but they won't let me review by color. I'd give the white ones only 1 star but the purple socks are awesome so they get 5 stars. Purple socks stay up where the white ones slip down into my tennis shoes.,5
B0015VHIF8,"Very comfortable, don't slip, good quality.",5
B0015VHIF8,"I have tried many no show socks and these are by far the best ones.  You can see very little of the sock when using running shoes, but I have noticed that if they are 100% no show they are not comfortable for exercise.  I used them for spinning and they are very comfortable.  I will buy more because they are great",5
B0015VHIF8,"These are hands down the best quality sock I have ever tried on. Despite being a no show sock I wanted one that fell at the edge of the sneaker and didn't slip down into the shoe.  There is absolutely no slippage with this sock.QUALITY: Well finished seams.  Bottom of the sock is well padded - besides walking, these are comfortable for around the house.FIT:  M - fits women size 8.5 / 9 well.",5
B0015VHIF8,"These are nice, but they sure are thick so they make my shoes to tight. I keep washing them thinking it will make them thinner.",3
B0015VHIF8,I am obsessed with these socks.  They  are the only ones I will wear!!  Totally worth the price as they are comfortable and just awesome.  Not too thin or too thick.  I wear them every day when I work out.  I am so spoiled and will never wear any other kind.,5
B0015VHIF8,You get what you pay for with these socks. I can't afford them but I do splurge when I can!,5
B0015VHIF8,Best socks i ever wore,5
B0CRHF41F7,My son needed black shorts to wear to his daily football workouts during the school year. These have worked wonderfully for him. They get washed OFTEN and are holding up well.  He is 5'10 and weighs about 150 and they fit him well.,5
B0CRHF41F7,The shorts were a better quality than I expected and fit just right and for the price I think it's a great deal. I've been using them for a few weeks now with no issues at the gym,5
B0CRHF41F7,This product runs a bit on the small size. The legs are tight. The material seems good and well-made.,3
B0CRHF41F7,"The size was great , we'll they're shorts , so they don't keep a person warm ... I  use them for walking every day , Quality is nice , MY wife and  I  loved the colors ...",5
B0CRHF41F7,These athletic shorts were just what we were looking for my husband. He just had knee surgery and he was looking for something comfortable that he could do his physical therapy in. The material is a great quality,5
B0CRHF41F7,"These shorts are comfortable, appear to be good quality, and are light without being see-through. The pocket capacity is sufficient to hold a cell phone, wallet, and keys.",5
B0CRHF41F7,They are plain . Nothing great and nothing bad. Good material. Arrived before anticipated date.,4
B0CRHF41F7,"This is my second purchase of these shorts. First one for me, second for my father-in-law. I stronger recommend these shorts for all.",5
B0CRHF41F7,A little thin but they feel good,4
B0CRHF41F7,So far so good. Very lightweight and comfortable.,4
B0CRHF41F7,I have several pairs and wear them daily. Very comfortable,4
B0CRHF41F7,Bought these for my husband and he loves the feel of the shorts. They are comfortable and lightweight.,5
B0CRHF41F7,These shorts were made of light weight. They had pockets. The elastic was sturdy enough to last. No drooping here. I would purchase these again.,4

B0CRHF41F7,"Light, comfortable, fit well.",5
B0CRHF41F7,"The only thing these are ""missing"" is a brand name on them somewhere, brand name quality without the price.  So if you can get over not being a billboard buy them!!  Purchased for my son for extra shorts to throw in his practice duffle but I have found that he prefers these over alot of his other name brand shorts.",5

B0CRHF41F7,"I ordered these for my husband to lounge around in and he really loves them! They are super comfortable and they actually look pretty nice so he wears them out running errands as well. The only issue I have found is that if you do not tie the strings prior to washing the shorts, the string will come out of the shorts and it is a pain to thread it back through.",5
B0CRHF41F7,Got them for my husband for gym,5
B0CRHF41F7,Comfy,5

B0CRHF41F7,Good value for price.,4
B0CRHF41F7,"Great buy. I love the fit, softness, and the deep pockets. A few months ago I lost my wallet in a supermarket. Fortunately, the guy who found it went through the store to find me and refused a reward, which I tried and would have been happy to reward him. Those were nice shorts but I realized the pockets were not deep. I checked all my short's pockets after that. Some were deep but only the heavy material shorts. These are the type of shorts I need for Florida summers. Now I can go shopping without worrying about losing my wallet.",5
B0CRHF41F7,"They were just what I expected, decent shorts and decent value",5
B0CRHF41F7,This are a perfect for what I wanted.,5

B0CRHF41F7,Cooler to wear,5
B0CRHF41F7,My husband loved them,5
B0CRHF41F7,Nice fabric,4
B0CRHF41F7,"Had these now for a couple of weeks and they are holding up well so far, nice and thick material so they aren't see through, the fit is good, would say it's slightly bigger than the size stated but they have plenty of stretch which is great",4
B0CRHF41F7,Not a fan of the shiny material but that is just personal preferancee.  Fit well and light weight,4
B0CRHF41F7,They are very well made,5
B0CRHF41F7,Light weight  good sizing,5
B0CRHF41F7,Se ven bien y son de buena calidad,4
B0CRHF41F7,These are little small,4
B0CRHF41F7,"These are actually some fairly good pants. Yes they are lightweight and seem easy to get dirty, but construction quality is decent and very much worth the price paid for them! The ones I received ran true to size,",4
B0CRHF41F7,Good for the price,4
B0CRHF41F7,Bought for my husband has good length down to his knees he says he really likes them and that they are comfortable,5
B0CRHF41F7,Wish they had a pocket in the back,4
B0059CVEDG,"They seem to be decent quality. They are a good thickness and seem to fit and stay up on my daughter's leg while playing. They didn't come with any holes, but we shall see how long they hold up for during games etc. They are on the pricey side for only 5 pairs of socks that are going to be used for a sport but what was asked to have ""nike"" by the coach. They do shrink a bit in the dryer, so I recommend hanging them I'd They have to stay a certain length for your sport.",5
B0059CVEDG,Look comfy!  I know my Grands will live them!,5
B0059CVEDG,Sock is what they are,5
B0059CVEDG,"Personally, I wear any socks. however I bought these brand apparently every teen has and my daughter loved them. Good price for these great quality socks.",4
B0059CVEDG,Great stocking stuffer.  Favorite socks by both girls and boys.  The black is a great choice too!,5
B0059CVEDG,Better price good quality !,5
B0059CVEDG,Nice socks for teen,5
B0059CVEDG,My daughter loves Nike - these socks get holes so easily - especially in the toe area - seems like the sewing is not good quality. We buy just because she likes the brand.,3
B0059CVEDG,MWE returnned the unopened ones since they were so long.She loves Nike dri-fit!,4
B0059CVEDG,Daughter loves the socks. Ordering her a second set.,5
B0059CVEDG,They were what I expected!,4
B0059CVEDG,good fit,5
B0059CVEDG,Good price,5
B0059CVEDG,New. Perfect item,5
B0059CVEDG,Love these socks but they came with out the dri-fit on the sock. Very nice though.,3
B0059CVEDG,Fit perfectly. Exactly as described.,5
B0059CVEDG,Really nice quality socks.,5
B0059CVEDG,"I would say they are overpriced. Purchase them for the logo, not the durability.",3
B0059CVEDG,Daughter loved these. She wore them till she outgrew them.,5
B0059CVEDG,"I've been ordering these for my kids for a while, but the last pair ordered the end of Oct was different. No lettering on the top front of sock, kids said they felt scratchier. Had I noticed, would have sent back before using two pairs.",2
B0059CVEDG,Good socks,5
B0059CVEDG,Love these socks.  They fit well and are very comfortable.  They keep my feet dry on really hot days when I'm sweaty.  I'm a half marathoner so I use these socks daily.  Love 'em.,5
B0059CVEDG,"I've had these on auto-ship, one package every six months, for a few years. The price has increased steadily, and the quality has gone down precipitously with each new shipment. They are now very thin and don't give the same support they used to.",3
B0059CVEDG,loveeeeee these socks i wear them everyday,5
B0059CVEDG,Love these ! Theyre so comfy !!! I use them for my gym socks and i never use any others !,5
B0059CVEDG,"I bought three packs and they were a hit with all three girls! Packaged well, arrived on time and made a great stocking stuffed for the holidays!",5
B0059CVEDG,"These socks tend to get holes in them very quickly. If it was up to me, I wouldn't buy them again.",3
B0059CVEDG,Great,5
B0059CVEDG,Exactly what the granddaughter wanted for sports..,5
B0059CVEDG,These socks shrunk a lot after the first wash. I'm not sure if they are truly cotton poly blend.,3
B0059CVEDG,These were not crew. They went more than halfway up her calf.,3
B0059CVEDG,My kids only wear these Nike dri fit socks so this was perfect and a great buy.,5
B0059CVEDG,Wider and shorter than true Nikes. Slouch down because of this.,2
B0059CVEDG,"I bought these as a Christmas present. When I opened the package, I found that a few of the socks have what appears to be dirt streaks and a couple have yellow splotches on them. Not happy.",3
B0059CVEDG,"Seems like I am forever putting another package in my Amazon cart as my boys wear them out four to use. Can be hard to track down at a store,  it easy to find on Amazon.",5
B0059CVEDG,My daughter loves these and she wears them all the time. The brand - fit - comfort - etc is great! We will buy them again! And Again!,5
B0059CVEDG,Good price for nice athletic socks.,5
B0059CVEDG,It was a gift for my great grandson. You want me to jump thru hoops for socks? Consider that some people are buying it as a gift,5
B0059CVEDG,"I love these socks, they are comfortable and as pictured! My only complaint will have to be that after the first wash they are no longer as soft as they were, although this might be something I am doing, I am not entirely sure. I don't have this issue with my other socks though.",4
B0059CVEDG,"I got these as a gift for my niece, she loves them.",5
B0059CVEDG,comodidad para trabajar varios horas de pie,4
B0059CVEDG,Received socks with stains on all pairs. Not very noticeable but not acceptable.,2
B0059CVEDG,Amazing and thick but not much stretch.,5
B0059CVEDG,Very nice,5
B0059CVEDG,My 3 grandsons only want me to buy these socks. They love them!,5
B0059CVEDG,The socks are not the same material as real drifit socks. Feels like they put a nike logo on fruit of the loom. Super thin and they fall down easily.,2
B0059CVEDG,My daughter is a dancer and she finds these so comfortable for arch support. She dancing in these. I wish they came in nude color.,5
B0059CVEDG,"I love Thees socks, but I need Large Size. I bought by a mistake Medium, ant it is tight for me.I was looking for this for a long time,",3
B0059CVEDG,"Very nice, fit perfectly",5
B0059CVEDG,These socks shrunk to half the size. Look like for 5 year old,3
B0059CVEDG,for nike its so thin and bad quality althlough its cute they rip too much,3
B0059CVEDG,Great product,5
B0059CVEDG,"These socks were a perfect fit but they feel different than other nike dri fit socks that I have. Although they feel different, these socks still work well and wick away the moisture. This is a great price point for dri fit socks especially from nike.",4
B0059CVEDG,Comfy,5
B0059CVEDG,Socks shrink after one wash.,3
B0059CVEDG,"These are not as thick and cushioned as the Nike dry athletic socks I bought a few years ago. Those old ones were fabulous, lots of cushion, and had L and R on the toes. These don't have the L and R, are thinner, and not as soft or thick.",3
B0059CVEDG,"I usually wear no show socks BUT these are perfect for wearing uncomfortable shoes, gym, and taller shoes. Oh and did I mention they fit PERFECTTT",5
B0059CVEDG,The seam digs in sometimes but I just maneuver it to where I can manage! This is my second set I bought really like it!,4
B0059CVEDG,Socks - just what I ordered!,5
B0059CVEDG,These are not dri fit socks,1
B0059CVEDG,"We specifically ordered these because they said they were Nike's ""Dry Cushion Crew Training Socks.""  We have gotten these socks before and want them specifically because of the weave and weight of the material that they are made from.  What was sent was Nike's ""Everyday Plus"" socks, which we have also gotten before and don't like--they are a completely different sock--much thicker and they don't fit the same way!  I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but they are not the sock that we ordered, and if we knew they were going to be the everyday plus socks, we wouldn't have ordered them--and paid $35 a package!  Now I have to go to the hassle to return them--and we still don't have the socks that we want--ugh!",1
B0059CVEDG,My daughter loves her socks (I had to return first set because I bought one size too big so read the sizing chart carefully).,5
B0059CVEDG,,5
B0059CVEDG,Not dri fit.,1
B0059CVEDG,I just wish more came in the pack.,5
B0059CVEDG,They are disintegrating with every use from the very first time they were worn. It makes me curious if they are authentic or not.,2
B0059CVEDG,They are very comfortable and keep your feet dry.,5
B0059CVEDG,Purchased this socks in January great quality.Re purchase another set from same seller in February n receive what appears to be fake Nike dry fit socks and shrink after first wash. Inspect order before opening,1
B0059CVEDG,My daughter is happy with purchase.  I think they're too thin though.,4
B0059CVEDG,I bought these for my granddaughter who plays high school soccer.,5
B0059CVEDG,My feet are size 10.  These socks are way too small.  They might be good for an adolescent.  But they're too small for most adult men.,2
B0059CVEDG,"Love the socks, they are real Nike's.",5
B0059CVEDG,I already had some of these socks so I knew going in the cuffs are a little snug but I love them anyway.  Keep your feet cool.,5
B0059CVEDG,Comfortable as pictured,5
B0059CVEDG,"I have worn Dri-Fit for 7 years. But now, Nike has made these socks to be ""just another pair of socks"", but priced much higher They seem much thinner and not as much cushion. I could have been just as happy with socks from Target.  The main objection I have is they no longer are making these socks to be ""left"" and ""right"" foot specific.  Wasn't that one of the great advantages that they had bragged about for so long??  They just don't make them like they used to!!!",2
B0059CVEDG,love this plush socks !,5
B0059CVEDG,Buy elsewhere.,3
B0059CVEDG,I bought them for my grandson and he loves them. This is the second year I bought them for him!,5
B0059CVEDG,Great socks!,5
B0059CVEDG,They keep my feet warm!,5
B0059CVEDG,4x what a sock should cost.,2
B07682XJLF,"This is an excellent shirt for a bargain price, especially when bought in the 10-pack.  There are no side seams to itch you.  The back neck and shoulders are covered in fabric which is not always the case in undershirts.  The front neck, armholes, cuffs, sleeve seams, and bottom hem are not fabric covered, but they are surged with a very soft thread which is much more comfortable than the surging in some of my other shirts that scratches and itches my skin.  I was worried that the crew neck would annoy me since I don't like anything tight around my neck, but it is loose enough that I can get it over my head with my glasses on, plus you can stretch it a little both ways when the shirt is wet.  The cotton in this shirt is soft and surprisingly heavy, not like a typical men's undershirt.  It is more an outer shirt than an undershirt, but it could be worn under a roomy outer shirt.  It has cuffs, which is a very nice feature especially if the sleeves are a little long on someone.  The weight and texture of the shirt seems to be between a tee shirt and a very light weight sweatshirt.  I am using one for sleeping and it feels soft against my face at night and keeps me warm but not hot.  The arms are long on me which I expected since I am only 5 feet 4 inches tall and I ordered the size large shirt.  The size chart indicated I should order a medium or even a small if I wanted a snug shirt, but I went with the large for the comfort and I'm happy with the roominess.  The sleeve width is roomy enough on me, but not too roomy.  The construction of this shirt is excellent, in fact perfect except for a thread or two that was not cut off.  I bought my shirts in the 10-pack and they arrived with all ten shirts ironed and folded in half neatly, all in one big plastic bag loosely taped shut and inside a big box.  I didn't have a problem with the fact that each shirt was not individually wrapped, and in fact I can use the big plastic bag.  Some reviewers said there were holes, unsewn seams and stains on their shirts, but mine were all in perfect new condition.  I washed them and dried them in the dryer, but they do take a very long time to dry.  I ended up hanging them up to complete the drying.  The only negative thing I can say about this excellent shirt is that it has two very annoying scratchy tags sewn right into the back neck seam.  You can't tear them off without ripping the stitches.  I cut them out very carefully with tiny scissors.  Here are the approximate dimensions of size large after washing and drying:  underarm sleeve length 23"", sleeve circumference at shoulder 20.5"", sleeve circumference at middle of sleeve 15"", back width at top between sleeve seams 20.25"",  circumference around the bottom 45.5"", length at back middle 29"".",5
B07682XJLF,"These are wonderful shirts.  Great price for even one, and you actually get two.  I bought three colors.  I put the second of each color away and will keep them for future use.  I'm a woman 5'6"" and weigh 150 lbs.  A large fits nice and roomy.  I love the banded cuffs.  Fabric is not too thin.  They go great alone or under a sweater.  100% cotton.",5
B07682XJLF,Only worn a few times but more hefty than a previous Amazon Basic purchase and more cost-effective than super-T's from Lands End or LL Bean.  Size is true (Large) and they are comfortable except for the bothersome label which can easily be removed.,4
B07682XJLF,"I've bought several of these in the past few years, and definitely recommend them. They're comfortable, somewhat warm, and durable. I haven't had any problems with them in 2 years of use.",5
B07682XJLF,"When I purchase the Gilden brand I know what quality I am getting. The shirts are ALWAYS as expected. I typically order these last minute and never have to worry about getting something unexpected. Soft, hold color, fit as described and expected. I use them to sleep in, everyday wear, husband wears to work, under his hoodies, and they work exceptionally well with hear press vinyl!",5
B07682XJLF,"Bought these for my boyfriend so he could have some nice long sleeve shirts.  After reading the reviews, I figured I would give them a try.  They are so soft and warm and cozy.  They came looking great and after many washes they still look brand new.  He loves it so much that he even wears it to bed.  They do not come out wrinkly from the dryer either.  This pack is a great deal for the quality of material and for the price.  I would get them again for him for sure and maybe even some for myself!",5
B07682XJLF,Ordered these for my husband. These are great shirts. He wanted something to just lounge around the house in. The only problem was it just took forever for them to ship the product. I made 2 other orders and got them before these ever came.  They need to work on getting the product out quicker. Other than that great product.,4
B07682XJLF,"I use these long sleeve tees for working around the house and yard and give them a lot of abuse. I sometimes also wear them when going about my day, not working. They are soft and comfortable. The size is as expected. The bulk packaging and pricing makes these an incredible value. I have purchased them more than once and will buy again. Highly recommended.",5
B07682XJLF,This is the third time ordering shirts for the company.  Better price for me to order here and have them print our logo on shirts. Work for a free service and am very satisfied on how the stand up to a good washing.,5
B07682XJLF,Originally I was sent the wrong color but it was the right product & right size. It was not my mistake. I asked for a full refund which I was given. I am happy with the product even though it is the wrong color. I can still use the product but for a different use.,5
B07682XJLF,"Great materials, light weight, very comfortable and fits so good. Also, makes you warm enough to not feel cold and not get too hot. Already have 4 different colors, and planing to get the T-shirt version for summer.",5
B07682XJLF,Perfectly fine long sleeve t shirt.,4
B07682XJLF,"Even after a wash, it still feels comfortable and looks like new and the price for the bundle is WORTH IT!",5
B07682XJLF,So the shirts came and we're actually thicker and nicer than I expected! Problem is they were sent in what appeared to be a small clear waste paper trash bag that was completely see through. The back had been torn and retapped back together several times and I'm actually surprised it made it here. Good job by USPS for getting it here in the condition it was sent in!!!!,4
B07682XJLF,As described. Christmas present for my son. He loves them.,5
B07682XJLF,My husband love this long sleeves shirts. Would definitely buy it again,5
B07682XJLF,"Not sure what Gildan puts in the fabric on these tees but it is quite resistant to staining.  I spilled some ice cream on it and thought the stain would set for sure.  Nope.  A little cold water daubed on the stain took it right out!  Amazing.  The tees are comfortable, too.  Thanks, Amazon! :)",5
B07682XJLF,I like the product very well,4
B07682XJLF,"Item shipped in Manufacturer's packaging . . . which is unsuitable for shipping.  Item arrived within its manufacturer's ultra thin vinyl packaging . . . torn open.  Product was OK and all intact.  When ordering this item, be sure to check the option for it to ship in Amazon packaging!!",4
B07682XJLF,"Nice cotton t-shirts, great price!",5
B07682XJLF,Received wrong item on 1st try. Return was simple and reordered. Correct order delivered when promised. Product is excellent!,5
B07682XJLF,"The description is confusing, the solid charcoal color tee is 100% cotton, but the top most description on the page says 50% cotton/ 50% polyester.",5
B07682XJLF,"I did not like that they didn't come in bags, were just thrown in a box. However, my husband has long arms and they are perfect length. Wrinkles out with a damp cloth into the dryer. Beautiful color and nice weight. Very pleased.",4
B07682XJLF,Product was what we ordered.  Just mis handled,4
B07682XJLF,Good quality long sleeve shirt. The matiral is thicker for a little added protection against the cold.,5
B07682XJLF,Well made and washes great.,5
B07682XJLF,Fits just right and just thick t shirt material,5
B07682XJLF,Good shirt.  Nice fit.,4
B07682XJLF,I love these shirts. My grandson wears them all the time. Good quality and material.,5

B07682XJLF,Durable.  Washable.,5
B07682XJLF,"Love this product, works well for my needs",5
B07682XJLF,cute size up,4
B07682XJLF,"This is my 2nd time purchasing these shirts.  They are quality products and wear well.  The 1st set was red & bought last year.  After numerous washings they have held their shape and color.  I do not usually place them into the dryer after washing however just because I don't want to chance them getting damaged.  They are warm but not too warm and look fashionable with jeans, slacks, or sweat pants.  The colors I have are red and black.",5
B07682XJLF,"Sized perfectly, quality of stitching , this color is a great green , they have lots of color choice, getting more in february",5
B07682XJLF,"Fabric is soft, comfortable, warm, and stretches well with movement. Bought for my son and he likes them!",5
B07682XJLF,Exactamente como en la foto,5
B07682XJLF,Thin and comfortable material,5
B07682XJLF,"I'm 180lbs and 5'10"" and the large fit me well. Not too heavy and very comfortable. I ordered 2 more.",5
B07682XJLF,great for the price,5
B07682XJLF,The gold standard in long sleeve tee shirts. My go to brand brand. Recommended.,5
B07682XJLF,Good work shirts,5
B07682XJLF,Thicker that anticipated which is a good thing. This can be worn as a tshirt or by itself. Does wrinkle out of the dryer but still a great value.,5
B07682XJLF,"Great shirts, thick, fit good an accurate sizes",5
B07682XJLF,Everything was outstanding.,5
B07682XJLF,"Bought for grandson who wears red Tshirts for work,he was pleased.",4
B07682XJLF,I ordered these for my son who wears a size 16 in boys. I got adult medium and they fit him well so they run on the small size. Shrunk slightly when washed but held up well thru the washer. Great shorts for iron ons.,4
B07682XJLF,Thanks,5
B07682XJLF,Comfortable,5
B07682XJLF,Slightly larger than other Gildan t-shirts.,4
B07682XJLF,Good fit and better quality than most.,5
B07682XJLF,I use them as night shirts and sleep in them....arms got cold in short sleeved T shirts....,5
B07682XJLF,Just what I needed.,5
B07682XJLF,Good quality,5
B07682XJLF,"Nice shirts, working well for wearing in winter condition",5
B07682XJLF,"Good quality long sleeve shirt. Made for an athletic built male. Only con is that the garment shrinks after one wash and dry cycle, so size up if you prefer a looser fit.",5
B07682XJLF,Very comfortable and breathable as well.,5
B07682XJLF,I was not expecting these long sleeved T-shirts to be this good of a quality product! I have to be picky about what black t-shirts I wear with my uniform because of dress standards. I bought these for the cold weather here in the Midwest and I was not expecting this great quality T-shirt to arrive. The shirt fits both my uniform dress code and the long sleeves are perfect in these drafty buildings when not wearing a coat.,5
B07682XJLF,great quality product!,5
B07682XJLF,good item,5
B07682XJLF,"Thick material, great for winter or outer wear. I would purchase again.",5
B07682XJLF,Returned it. The color shown was not the color I received,5
B07682XJLF,Did shrink a bit in the washer so keep that in mind,4
B07682XJLF,They wash well.  They retain shape and color soft after washing .  Nice,5
B07682XJLF,They are very comfortable and keep you worm,5
B07682XJLF,"I ordered a size up expecting washer/dryer shrinkage, but they didn't. A sturdy product resistant to washer fade.",4
B07682XJLF,Good quality shirts. They do run big so order a size down.,5
B07682XJLF,I bought these to caramelize popcorn. They are comfy and the steam allows for the fabric to gain moisture. The fans hit it and cool me down instantly.,5
B07682XJLF,Comfy and fit nice,5
B07682XJLF,Came in a plastic bag not properly sealed. It rained and the shorts were soaked. Otherwise they are ok.,4
B07682XJLF,"Grabbed these for a few shirts I had to make for Christmas. Very soft, light weight and perfect fit.",5
B07682XJLF,It's just a good old fashioned shirt. 10/10,5
B07682XJLF,I have Gildan T-Shirts in short and long sleeve. They seem to be good quality and fit well. I will be purchasing more.,5
B07682XJLF,A great fit and extremely comfortable to wear,5
B07682XJLF,"I love this fabric, cotton is all year round",5
B07682XJLF,Son para el trabajo de mi esposo pero salio muy grande la camisa,4
B07682XJLF,"Good work sheets, great price, got greasecleans nice",5
B07682XJLF,Good quality.  Size good.  But my mistake thought it had pocket.,4
B07682XJLF,"True to size, great quality and great material",5
B07682XJLF,Decent shirts for the quality and price,5
B07682XJLF,"fit,material,great",5
B07682XJLF,"These are good, durable shirts.  Perfect length.",5
B07682XJLF,i like a long sleeve tee in winter in my neck of the woods.,5
B07682XJLF,"Good quality , good fit !",5
B07682XJLF,"I received 2 packs ,(6 total) and put them in the wash. No obvious shrinkage or color bleed. These Gilden brand shirts are heavy quality.  However, the 2 xl tags attached at the collar rub on your neck and in my case, caused a ""raw"" spot. Why Gilden? Just print the size like every other Tshirt manufacturer!",5
B07682XJLF,Very good quality. True size.,5
B01LY3S185,"Most everything I wear is XL so I ordered XL. It fits tight, very tight. Picture skin tight hip-huggers. I'll keep it because it's been washed. PS. I've ordered XXL and it just arrived. Everything fits perfectly, loose and comfy BUT legs are too long. Great quality so I'll keep it and just have the length fixed.",5
B01LY3S185,Runs small.,5
B01LY3S185,The pants are short. I think they fit great otherwise and feel soft and stretchy. The material is thick and durable. Wish they were a couple inches longer.,4
B01LY3S185,"Great sweats for the price- I paid as low as $9.99 for Navy Blue. Open bottom sweats are so much better than their elastic bottom counterpart.  They're warm and the fitment is decent. I am 5'8"" and the length run a bit long for me. If I had to guess, I'd say these LARGE fit a 32-40 waist and 32-34 length (total guess). My biggest complaint is these are a lot like ""low-rise"" jeans. There's not much room from crotch to waistband so these do ride a little lower than I'm used to. Not a deal-breaker. My second biggest complaint is the pockets are very shallow. My phone is an iPhone Pro so it's the bigger version and it barely fits in the pocket and sometimes falls out when sitting down as another review mentioned. I plan to get my sewing machine out and hem the ankle to my exact fit. If these were $25 or higher, I'd return them but at the price I paid, I intend to keep them, unless they shrink a lot.",3
B01LY3S185,"I purchased these for my daughter-in-law who is 6 months pregnant, it was one of the Christmas gifts she asked for. She loves them and they are good quality, and the price I paid for them was a very good price in my opinion.",5
B01LY3S185,These sweatpants are a perfect fit made from quality materials for all day comfort and warmth.,5
B01LY3S185,They are the perfect length. Quality was awesome,5
B01LY3S185,As I stated when I returned the 2 previuos of the's pants I beleive everyone should try these. To add the only thing I would make better is the pockets should be deeper or have zippers or a way to keep items in.,5
B01LY3S185,"I have been buying Gilden tee shirts for years and found that there is no better value. A decent quality at a super price. These sweatpants are typical Gilden. Cheap and decent quality. They won't last forever but they are perfect for working around the house. These looked and fit exactly as expected. I am not sure how Gilden is able to offer this level of quality at these low prices, but I hope it lasts. If I can find it by Gilden it's for me. You know what you are getting, and you are not overpaying for a label. For work or home this is my go-to company for clothing. For going out i step up to better quality and name brands. Buying Gilden clothing allows me to afford the nicer stuff when i need it. Now that our local Boscov's is no longer in business Amazon is my only outlet for Gilden shirts and joggers. I highly recommend these for what they are. Best value for clothing available.",4
B01LY3S185,The sweat pant was overall a great purchase. It was light and comfortable. But the sweat pants was tight above my knee and below my waist.,4
B01LY3S185,Good stuff,4
B01LY3S185,"These pants are very comfy, nice and warm and wash up well in cold watcher in the washing machine. I have a couple pairs of them, and would purchase more if they made them in more colors.",5
B01LY3S185,Great sweatpants...I will only ever buy Gildan..no shrinkage at all,5
B01LY3S185,"Great price, and quality!Definitely a good price for basic open leg fleece pant..True to size..",4
B01LY3S185,nice and warm,5
B01LY3S185,"My son is 14 with physical disabilities and wears AFOs.  These pants are great because they aren't too tight, have room for his foot braces, and can wear with any top since they are open bottom pants. I like how it's one draw string...makes it easier to adjust where I want to knot it.  After a lot of wear and washings they start looking worn, but that's with any sweatpant material.  I am disappointed in the price though.  I bought my son pants in spring and they were only $11.  I have to buy a bunch more because he's taller, and they are now $17.  That's a lot for sweatpants and a big difference in price.  My one issue (which everyone else wrote about) is that there's not more fabric up top.  It rides too low over the butt and is an issue when sitting down.",4
B01LY3S185,"These have a low rise compared to most sweatpants, which I would prefer usually but is so low in the back that it is uncomfortable for me.  Maybe going up a size would work but it only goes up to XXL which is what this is.  And for reference, I have a pair of another brand in a Large and most in XL that fit, so I would say it runs small, also. The length is good for me which is nice as I have a 32 inch inseam and these are fine so I would have liked to keep them but the rise is too much of an issue for me.",3
B01LY3S185,great product,5
B01LY3S185,These are made good and washes great. Pockets are nice.,5
B01LY3S185,My dad loved these. They are soft and comfortable. My mom loves them because they last!,5
B01LY3S185,Excelente,5
B01LY3S185,It did shrink a little on first washing.  The fit is good.  Pockets are very shallow .,4
B01LY3S185,Got these for under $10 - I was thrilled. Comfy sweats for the colder season while I lounge around the house. Very soft interior. They hold up well.,4
B01LY3S185,"Looks great, seams are solid, very warm and  comfortable and with 2 exceptions it fits perfectly.I wish it had more room for my backside. I'm not overweight and normally think I have what they call a long back, but there's no extra room for my butt. When I've got the waistband at the appropriate position, the inseam is right against my undercarriage. My other complaint is the string to tie the waistband is really thin, and I question how long it will last.I was on the fence about returning for something that might be better, but it's just good enough for me to avoid that hassle.",3
B01LY3S185,As of this date order one size up in navy. They pants are definitely miss sized. A chance to score a good deal. They are about one inch to long on me but that could be because of the miss sizing. As a woman in a wheelchair they are fine for me. Better longer than too short. The tag says heavy blend.,4
B01LY3S185,Far too long but seem to be made well..,4
B01LY3S185,"My son only wears sweats and I didn't want to spend a lot on them so I could buy him a few pairs. These work, pockets are nice,  and they are average thickness, not sure how warm they will be in the winter. I'm not sure how many times he has washed them but they have already started to fade and are not soft but not terribly rough. We'll see how long they last with regular washing. I bought size medium.EDIT 12/18- Son ordered another pair so I guess he really likes them. He wears and washes them weekly and so far they are still good.",3
B01LY3S185,Decent sweats,5
B01LY3S185,These sweat pants are very warm nice for laying around the house on a cold day.,5
B01LY3S185,Too big for a petite man,3
B01LY3S185,I have a lot of  pants like this these were guarantedd to fall down distance from wasitline to crotch made them snug,3
B01LY3S185,Product is smaller than others purchased with the same size.,3
B01LY3S185,Piling after one wash. Just OK,3
B01LY3S185,"Not only are the pockets way too small the waistband doesn't rise up far enough in the back - so you always feel like you are going to have ""plumbers butt"". They just feel cheap and fit weird, pass.",3
B01LY3S185,I get men sweats.  Why?  Because they have pockets!  And I like Gildan :),5
B01LY3S185,"I purchased two pairs, a large and XL. The only difference in the fit is the length. You would expect the XL to have a larger cut.",3
B01LY3S185,I purchased the medium size. They fit my waist but they're too long in length by about 5 to 6 in too long I have to roll them up so I don't walk on him or take them to a Taylor and have them hemmed up because I'm not capable of doing that myself and I don't know of anybody who can help me do that for me so I got to pay somebody to size them up and him them.,3
B01LY3S185,"I bought these same pants (and same size) twice before and I loved them.  I just got two new pair and they weren't just a little tight, I gave them to my son.  Just couldn't deal with the discomfort.",4
B01LY3S185,Name brand Gildan does not disappoint. Good quality material and workmanship.,5
B01LY3S185,"Just keep in mind: it does not sit well on my waist; fabric is thin, looks cheap.",3
B01LY3S185,"I wear size 36 pants, 30 inseam, and these are a bit tighter and MUCH Longer (like 34) than the ""Large"" size the manufacturer claims!  BUT, it will stretch in the waist as you wear them for a few days. But when you wash, you have to start all over again. I use them a lounging pants around the house, so they don't get dirty or smelly, wearing them for 3 days in a row they fit acceptably by the 2nd day. Quality is excellent and so far they haven't  faded.",4
B01LY3S185,This item is very comfortable and properly warm. Pockets are somewhat small.,4
B01LY3S185,You get what you pay for buy they meet my needs. They are what I expected but they are not a great fitting pair of sweats. I would not recommend for gym use if doing lots of weights or squats but for low intensity walking they seem fine.,4
B01LY3S185,"Probably perfect for a big tall guy but I ordered the wrong size so will keep them for a friend's gift. These pants are for men but I'm a tall lady 5'8"" 185 lbs and these are too big and too long for me. The material is strong and it is well made. The light grey looks good for spring.",4
B01LY3S185,These sweat pants work perfectly for my husband.  Fit as stated.  Comfortable,5
B01LY3S185,Allow for some shrinkage. We love the nonelastic cuffs,4
B01LY3S185,Great fit but a little baggy,5
B01LY3S185,"The pants are perfect for medical procedures.  They are warm and comfortable and have no metal zippers or other metal parts that can often not allowed for many tests.  My husband has two pair, and he is always comfortable and able to wear them for all his procedures.  Thank you for making them available.",5
B01LY3S185,The fit is true and they are a sturdy weight.  They are starting to pill after several washings but since they were bought for my husband to wear while working on his lawnmower that's not a big deal.,4
B01LY3S185,"Comfortable, warm, what more could you ask for in a sweat pant.",5
B01LY3S185,"Fabric is fine, legs are good, but they are very low-rise.  Slide right down like I would not expect the size that I bought would do.  Not good for my body.",3
B01LY3S185,"Liked the fabric, waist fit well, but it had no room in the fanny.",3
B01LY3S185,"The first pair I got with the Amazon ""try before you buy"" program.  I like that pair so much that I bought two more pairs.  I am a woman, so my thighs are a little bigger which makes these a little tight at that part of my body.  I also have a badunkadunk, but these fit that quite well.  My favorite is the length and open bottom.  I am 6' feet tall and these still go past my ankles without dragging on the ground.  Looking forward to the upcoming colder weather and being able to be snug and warm in these.",4
B01LY3S185,"Nice product but if available I would buy one size larger,",3
B01LY3S185,Works as intended for me,5
B01LY3S185,"Love how these fit. Perfect baggy look and the material seems strong and soft. I feel like they would be tough to rip at the gym. Reason for down mark is the size of the pockets. I can barely fit my hand in and definitely not the whole hand. Only front pockets available  (normal, not a complaint, but I always do prefer a back pocket)  Hope it improves. I would not buy again if it doesnt, as I am forced to use a fanny pack, no way my phone is going to fit.",2
B01LY3S185,These are a lower rise and run a little small. I gave them to my son.,3
B01LY3S185,Goes over his wrapped legs,5
B01LY3S185,Great value for money. You get what you paid for. Good for everyday use or at the gym. Pockets were too small though.,4
B01LY3S185,"My 14 yo grandson is 6 foot tall. I ordered 3 different brands of sweatpants to see which would work. All were ordered in a men's small. The Gildan brand, which I love for tshirts, did not work. They were very short on him.",3
B01LY3S185,This has small pockets and there draw string but it's just a loop coming threw requires constant adjustment n no elastic band in the waist what so ever,3
B01LY3S185,"I had been asked to hang with some friends and chose to wear these to show off my sick new sweatpants, this was the beginning of the end. I did not realize beforehand that these were low waisted sweatpants and thought that they would fit normally. So, me and my friends decided to play hide and seek cause we had gotten a bit bored. I chose to hide with another friend from the seeker behind our car, and as soon as I squatted down that is when I felt the sunshine rays shine upon the darkness. I got laughed at for three weeks for this and now wear them as house pants.",3
B01LY3S185,"Sizing is wayyy off. I ordered a medium like I always do for a family member, and these were monstrous! You could have had another person wear them.",2
B01LY3S185,Other pants fit better.,3
B01LY3S185,"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            True to size, light weight and very soft no tag tee shirt. Colors are deep and accurate. These shirts don't shrink when you wash them.",4
B01LY3S185,Comfy and soft nice pockets,5
B01LY3S185,Will be perfect Iowa Winters. Wish the leg openings were a little narrower. I added a piece of elastic at the verry bottom. Problem solved!,5
B01LY3S185,"Great price, warm but like most, does not want to stay up in the back.  Does not fit well in the waist.",3
B01LY3S185,4 because there is no back pocket.,4
B01LY3S185,"I got what I expected for a cheap pair of sweatpants,, The length is too long and the crotch is a bit too tight. The pockets are a joke, I can barely fit my hand in them. I needed a pair so these will do. Next time I'll spend a bit more.",4
B01LY3S185,"I buy three pair of these every year because where I live I can wear them about half the year. I do not own a clothes dryer so they're washed on cold and line dried. But still the elastic is substandard and after a year, they are too loose to wear. Next year I am finding a higher quality brand that will last more than six months.",3
B01LY3S185,Cut/distance from the waist to the crotch too short. Also blend is much heavier of a material than wanted for hot six month season here in Arizona weather.,2
B01LY3S185,"If you're looking for a classic pair of sweats, these are it!Straight leg, heavier fabric (they don't feel cheap or ""athletic"")Nice drawstring on the inside of the waistband.Only gripe is they feel like they want to sit a little low in the back, but this is very minor and I would definitely buy these again.",5
B01LY3S185,"The cloth is good, leg length is good as is the waist. But the rise area (waist to crotch) is oddly short.  It's currently in style, but feels weird when jogging or working out.",4
B01LY3S185,TO COVER MY BARE A  - -,4
B01LY3S185,Not the most comfortable thing in the world but for the price its pretty good,4
B01LY3S185,These fit great for about a month; but after that the fabric started to fleece and they began clinging to my thighs making me look completely homeless. Not even suitable for at home wear at this point.,3
B01LY3S185,"I knew the pant legs were cut long, that did not bother me.  As it turns out the pockets are very small, a very small smart phone won't fit all the way in.  I bought 2 pairs, on both pairs the waist adjustments strings failed.  Not a serious repair but a very bothersome one.",3
B01LY3S185,"The size chart didn't work for me. showed i needed  SMALL.I am  5'11' and 155, the pants were at least 1 inch too short.waist was goodthe draw string installation is a bit weird, but the realdownfall is the quality of the drawstring ( needs to be a lot better ie. make itsturdy as it will be PULLED a lot)The quality of the rest is good. so good i returned the ones too shortand ordered the size i normally order... LARGE ...and they fit good, becausethe waist is variable (about 30 - 40) and the length touches the top of shoes (ie. long enough).",4
B01LY3S185,Small draw string.  not very heeavy,4
B01LY3S185,"wear it at home, include bedtime",5
B01LY3S185,The size was sort of unisex. No prob if you arenot taller or shorter .,4
B01LY3S185,"Good quality, very comfortable and soft.",5
B01LY3S185,"At 125lbs 5' 6.5"", 27""waist, and 37""hips I would have ordered an XS, but the smallest available was small, which I ordered. The length was okay. But the waist, hips, thighs and legs were too big. Also, they are light weight fleece so not what I would wear in the cold and winter without fleece leggings underneath.",4
B01LY3S185,"Nicely made. Fit well, true to size. Material feels good.",5
B01LY3S185,"Gildan usually has quality products but this one missed.  Two major issues, the pockets are tiny (won't hold a cell phone) and the waistband won't hold up.  The material is fine and is sewn well, just a poor design.",2
B07T65MPB5,"The perfect socks for me!  White athletic socks, just the right thickness (not too thick, nor too thin) and not too tight.  Half cotton for comfort; half polyester for minimal shrinkage--soft and comfortable.  Free delivery in one day.  What more to ask for?",5
B07T65MPB5,Just alittle to long but a good sock,4
B07T65MPB5,"I wore Hanes socks for years, and intermittently tried lots of other brands to see if something was better. Somehow Hanes quality and consistency went completely downhill. You'd order a pair of socks and something very different than description would come to your door. This wasn't just an Amazon thing, the quality of Hanes socks seem to be going down and down.I sincerely didn't realize how on point a pair of socks could be. These socks have a band that go around the midpoint of your foot which keeps the socks from getting loose and sloppy. This band could seem tight at first, but it's not. I've had no discomfort and I LOVE how it keeps the sock in place. This is my first pair of socks with that feature, but now I can't imagine if want socks without it!Today I'm reordering them because the first order has lasted so well and I just want to have a lot more of them so I can get rid of my others, and I think it helps socks last longer. I wear socks without shoes around the house most days and these have really held up.You get six pairs for the price, and considering the quality that's very good.Also the feel is nice! I don't like those overly plastic fully synthetic feeling socks, and this blend of cotton and synthetics is just about right.Never thought I'd be raving about a pair of basic everyday socks, but for some reason it took a while to find socks made like this, and made this well. Unless something changes these are going to be my go-to socks for the foreseeable future.I do wish this brand would come out with the same sock but a THICKER option. These aren't thin, but I really do like a thick sock especially now that slip-on shoes are the style and functional more than laced.Sizing: I generally wear a 10 size shoe and the 9-12 size fits perfect for me. I only own the black, I have not tried other colors.",5
B07T65MPB5,"Very comfortable and they fit snug around the calf, but not too tight with good elastic. Great socks and I will buy again!",5
B07T65MPB5,"Good socks. Good fit, except for the ankles. They are too tight around the ankles. I'm going to stop wearing them if they don't loosen up. I have normal size ankles. I bought the black socks.",3
B07T65MPB5,"The socks seem of very good quality.  But the box listed a size chart yet the box didn't give the these socks a specific size and they were way  too big for me and for my husband.  We will wear them , however, on winter evenings when it's especially cold.  So they are now out reading and watching TV socks.",4
B07T65MPB5,I needed socks and decided to try this brand. I read the reviews and folks said their feet stayed warm. Purchased these socks and they were right. I was surprised to see 6 pairs of socks in the box (I guess I missed that information under the description). I am very happy of my choice that I am in the process of purchasing more of these socks but a different color.,5
B07T65MPB5,"This was a purchase for my mom because she needed new white socks! She said these were perfect! They were soft, comfortable and made very well!We love, AMAZONTy",5
B07T65MPB5,"I've had trouble finding socks that actually fit. Most socks are sold in only a couple of sizes. When they say fits size 6 to 12, that's stupid. It's nice to find some that fit.",4
B07T65MPB5,Great quality sox at a reasonable price.,5
B07T65MPB5,Soft and durable. I will purchase again.,5
B07T65MPB5,They are perfect I love them,5
B07T65MPB5,Surprisingly good quality. Fast shipping.,5
B07T65MPB5,Very comfortable,5
B07T65MPB5,They were a little thinner than what i was expecting.,4
B07T65MPB5,The socks are soft and comfortable,4
B07T65MPB5,Very breathable but still supple,5
B07T65MPB5,"Excellent socks, very comfortable and sit well on the foot",5
B07T65MPB5,Comfy socks! My Dad loved them!,5
B07T65MPB5,Very Happy! These socks are soft and breathable.,5
B07T65MPB5,"The headline says it all, these  most comfortable socks I've ever owned.  I waited to do a review because I wanted to put them to the ultimate test and wear them during a full day volleyball tournament, and they passed the test!  They remained incredibly comfortable and functional.  I had toe surgery last summer and ever since I'm a little more sensitive in my feet so these have been awesome for me.  I'm slowly retiring all of my previous name brand athletic socks and replacing them with these.",5
B07T65MPB5,"I live in Phoenix and these are too thick and warm for me, but they are well made. Will definitely keep you comfortable in a normal climate",4
B07T65MPB5,Nice,4
B07T65MPB5,I threw out my older pairs and THESE ARE GREAT,5
B07T65MPB5,"No branding, not too tight but stay up, no odor, great",5
B07T65MPB5,Needed new pairs that are more durable and these work. At a great Value as well . Very Warmth during this winter season I tend to buy white socks because they easily match anything. I run alot outdoors and needed a few pairs that are functional with compression and slip resistance which all grade well here. Very happy with this purchase,5
B07T65MPB5,GREAT,5
B07T65MPB5,Very comfortable and good material,5
B07T65MPB5,My husband is pleased with the sox,5
B07T65MPB5,Bought these for my son for a training camp.  He loved them and after month of use arr still great.,4
B07T65MPB5,"just read the title. other than a few novelty socks, these are the only things that will be going on my feet!",5
B07T65MPB5,Warm,5
B07T65MPB5,"Warm, comfy socks, good length.. comfortable in 14 degree weather!",5
B07T65MPB5,"They are comfortable, they allow your feet to breath, and as someone who has to wear compression socks during the day, it is a pleasure to take them off and put on these wonderful socks when I go to sleep. They protect the arch, and while not compression, I love that I got the large ones that still come up to just below my knee, and I feel so comforted when I go to sleep with these on. I have to be careful when I wake up because they grip my calves so nicely, I will sometimes forget to put on my compression socks; but when I do, the feet and leg are still perfectly normal as they should be. I would recommend these to anyone wanting very comfortable socks that allow your feet to breathe.",5
B07T65MPB5,"The old crew socks were getting holey and losing elasticity, so I went for something both absorbent and cushioned.  These new socks are well-cushioned and absorb foot sweat adequately.  They are a little longer than my old ones, though, so take a smidge more effort to pull onto my feet.  Elastic ribbing, common in most socks from lower to mid-calf, are included in the instep/bridge portion, which may help in the lifetime of the socks by resisting creep and bunching.",4
B07T65MPB5,The socks are as they were shown and comfortable.,5
B07T65MPB5,They are a good boot for this time of year,4
B07T65MPB5,got what I ordered,5
B07T65MPB5,the color was the same as demin.It is so difficuly to get the blue color of demim. They look well made but I just got the order.at this point I would buy again.,5
B07T65MPB5,I bought some of these a couple of weeks ago (light gray) and I really liked them so I bought some more (Navy blue.)  For years I've worn nothing but gold toe Uptown Crew socks but I like these better.  I liked them so much I decided I better get a review on here and help my fellow sock enthusiasts.,5
B07T65MPB5,Sizing was good. I wear size 14 shoes and hard to find socks that are big enough. It says it is cushioned but not much there.,4
B07T65MPB5,"I am very happy to have found such a high cotton content in these socks, I have a 14 year old boy who benefits from all the tricks we can provide to keep them smelling OK. Cotton socks are a priority.  These are nicely made, comfortable, and definitely less expensive than other cotton socks that charge a LOT more (ie, Bombas, which have all had holes in them after a short amount of time!)  They are also good looking socks in nice colors for boys (soft olive green and a denim- like blue.  Much better than black and white!!)",5
B07T65MPB5,It's exactly what I order. It's a Christmas gift,5
B07T65MPB5,"These are classic athletic socks like we wore in the 70s. I am tall & they come to my upper calf.Good, even compression, but not constricting at the tops I'd give 5 stars, but the overall quality isn't 5 stars: I suspect they may fall apart after a few washings. We shall see.",4
B07T65MPB5,"Very pleased, not as much cushion as expected but the arch support works and overall I really like them",5
B07T65MPB5,"Photo is generally accurate, though socks are actually darker blue than shown: navy blue as described, which is nearly black.  Hopefully they will lighten a bit with repeated washing.  Comfortable, and a good all-around socks for moderate temperatures.",5
B07T65MPB5,My step son said they are comfortable and soft,5
B07T65MPB5,I have to put my husbands socks on because of back issues. They are easy for me to put on but stay in place all day without scrunching down.,5
B07T65MPB5,"I love these socks. Bought them three times. Unfortunately, they got smaller and smaller every time I washed them.",3
B07T65MPB5,Good weight..not too thin and not too thick! Thin enough to keep your shoes from being too tight but thick enough to be warm. Good stretch and the top of the sock stays up!  Good value and look nice. Will purchase again?,5
B07T65MPB5,"I was trying to ""buy again"" from a prior order, but these socks were slightly longer and more plush than the prior, which was very good!",5
B07T65MPB5,"I wanted something more than just plain white socks. I bought these and they not only look good, they feel great. The only minor complaint is I wish they were a size larger.",4
B07T65MPB5,"Great socks,light and comfortable, will definitely buy again.",5
B07T65MPB5,"They're blue, fit on my foot and were shipped on time. There's not much you can say about socks.",5
B07T65MPB5,"These socks hold up so well!  My son has a size 14 foot and we order the XL.  They have continued to hold up very well. We have purchased these repeatedly.  They dont pill up and discolor.  They retain very good shape and wear very well. We switched to these because of price point and have been very happy.  Ribbing stays tight and does not lose shape, would highly recommend.",5
B07T65MPB5,Very comfortable and breathable.,5
B07T65MPB5,"Good comfortable socks,good compression,but not too tight.",5
B07T65MPB5,"I needed new socks as my old ones were getting holes in them. I ordered this box of socks. They are comfortable and fit well, and you get a lot in a box. Thickness seems perfect. They stay in place once you put them on. Not sure about durability yet as I just got them. I have yet to see if they are hole-prone. I am hoping not.",5
B07T65MPB5,These socks fit perfect. They are soft but have great compression. The sole is padded but not bulky. Great value .,5
B07T65MPB5,You get what you pay for but no more.  Too much exposed and loosely secured elastic thread in the calf end of the socks.  Easy to catch on the corner of a toe nail when putting on.  This is a common feature of cheap athletic socks.,3
B07T65MPB5,Good every day sock. All white version is a Summer sock,5
B07T65MPB5,This is the first time I have purchased socks from an unknown retailer. So far the have performed well,5
B07T65MPB5,"Having aged, my feet now have more aches and pains. I needed a sock that would cushion them somewhat. I'm happy to say these socks do exactly that. After looking at reviews for a long time I took a chance on these because none of the reviews said they were ""thin"" or something similar. I'm very happy these worked out. They feel like a glove around my feet and are very comfortable to wear. Nice color too.",5
B07T65MPB5,The socks are a good quality and buy,5
B07T65MPB5,Dickies are more padded and that is what I wanted,3
B07T65MPB5,"I was not sure what to expect, these socks are great quality have a great fell and fit well.",5
B07T65MPB5,These ARE NOT unisex.,3
B07T65MPB5,"I had to return my first order and get a larger size because the sizing runs small. Now that I have the larger size, they work just fine.",4
B07T65MPB5,"It is so comfortable, soft, and tight but the necessary, materials are a good combination, for me it is a perfect balance, thank you so much.",5
B07T65MPB5,"The socks are easy to put on, but I was expecting them to be a little more robust in their thickness.",3
B07T65MPB5,"Great socks, good thickness and stretch! They wash nicely not too much shrinkage! I would buy them again.",5
B07T65MPB5,Good overall: But way to high for workout socks in the gym!,3
B07T65MPB5,Excellent socks. I wanted them taller on the ankle and thick. Did not disappoint.,5
B07T65MPB5,"They are made to be matched with Yeezy Slides in Onyx color, and which I did! They look so good!",5
B07T65MPB5,Clothing,5
B07T65MPB5,Crew socks rise to above mid-calveVery confortableNavy blue multi-dark weaveGood looking,4
B07T65MPB5,These socks are well made. The elastic is 4way stretch and the socks squish youre feet a little too much from the front of toes to the back of the heel.,4
B07T65MPB5,As advertised,5
B07T65MPB5,"As others pointed- the white socks have a tiny red mark on them. Its on the ""inside"" so you can't really see it, but I specifically looked for all white socks, and this is not it.They are not as thin as can be perceived from the advertisement, but not too bulkier either.So far they meet expectations.",4
B07T65MPB5,"I've been looking for blue, athletic-type socks that would look good with blue jeans for ages. These have a great pattern of blue with black highlights that make them a great color match for all of my jeans; stone washed, indigo, dark blue. They could be a little softer, but a few times through the wash might do that. I didn't rank durability because I've only worn them a couple of times. But at $3 at pair, these are hard to beat!",4
B07T65MPB5,"These might be the only socks I wear for the rest of my life. They're warm but not too warm, thick but not so thick that shoes don't fit, and they're a nice generic gray so they can pass for formal and informal.",5
B07T65MPB5,I buy these for my son and he said they are the best socks! He works out every day and lifts weights and says they keep his feet dry and comfortable.,5
B07T65MPB5,Great fitting socks and thicjker than store bought socks,5
B07T65MPB5,Black socks are needed for a job and they fit great,5
B07T65MPB5,"Nice white socks, stitched design is pretty",5
B07T65MPB5,"These are NICE WELL MADE socks!  However the size 10-13 socks I ordered were way to tight for my SIZE 12 DIABETIC FEET!!!I ordered size 13-15 socks and the toe-box size was good.  However, I have average size ankles and these size 13-15 socks are tight!Be very careful if your returning size 10-13 and ordering 13-15 -- there's a glitch in Amazon's ordering webpages.  I ordered 13-15 and received 10-13.  One webpage says I ordered ""XL"" and another says I ordered ""L"".  I just reordered 13-15 and will returned the 10-13 that I was sent in error.  No big deal because the item gets returned to Staples, packaging & shipping are taken care of by them.",4
B07T65MPB5,Fit is wayyy too tight,3
B07T65MPB5,I am getting ready to order more of these socks for my. husband. He normally burns through socks like crazy. The last time we purchased these was in September 2021 and they are just now showing signs of wear and needing replacement. Amazing! He likes the stretchy arch support and the fit. He wears a size 12-13 shoe and the XL size fits him well. Best socks ever.,5
B07T65MPB5,these socks are great best I've bought in a while,5
B08D6WVXQW,"I bought these shirts to go under my dress shirts as a 'protective barrier'.  Regular undershirts tend to be slightly more on the bulky side and not the comfort I desire.  These are perfect!!  So soft, fitted, stretchy, cool, and versatile!  I couldn't have picked out a better ""T"".  The ONLY criticism I have - I wear an XL in literally everything, except these - I had to return and order XXL - this was too fitted, as in snug and not comfortable.  I am excited for the XXL - aside from running small, these shirts are SO WORTH IT!!!!!",5
B08D6WVXQW,I had purchased 32 degrees shirt before from another retailer. So I decided to order from Amazon. To my surprise they made from different materials and in a different country. Previous purchase were from China and these were made in the Middle East. To tell you the truth they both are very comfortable to wear. This purchase are the stretchable kind and conform to your body shape. Very good value for the money.  All in all very pleased.,5
B08D6WVXQW,My husband loves these T- shirts. very comfortable and light material.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"I thought these were going to be great and replaced my undershirts for work. Got them and they felt great, seemed like they kept me cooler(might be in my head but still), they fit nicer than a plain white cotton undershirt. But i ended up going back to plain white cotton shirts, not sure why but i was getting what i thought was a heat rash in my arm pits. Not sure why, if its the material, if its treated with something but i stopped wearing them and it stopped. So not sure why only in that spot and not on my back but guess im a plain cotton shirt guy that cant have fancy undershirts. but they seemed good, maybe a little thinner, but hey it was an undershirt for a button up shirt job and i was wanting cooler for a summer in the south.",4
B08D6WVXQW,I'm an armed security officer. I was looking for a quality shirt to wear in uniform. My search is over. It fits and wears well. I love this brand. I purchased V-Necks by this brand and I'm impressed. I'm a retired Marine.  I wish this company made shirts for the military when I was in.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Found these at Costco a few years ago. Wear them everyday.  Cool,  super soft and comfortable. Also extremely durable, non fading, bleach resistant, wrinkle free and does not overstretch after years of hard service.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Best shirts ever. Best fit and when I hugged someone they complimented how soft it felt. No shrinkage and great value for money. Will buy in black now.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Best T shirts I have had. They don't shrink like every pair I get, fit perfectly, collar stays nice. I would by a size bigger then what you normally get.  Excellent product and I will be buying more.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Seems to be a quality shirt. Good fit and nice material.,5
B08D6WVXQW,They are very comfortable and breathable.,5
B08D6WVXQW,These are fenominal and great undershirts,5
B08D6WVXQW,These shirts work great as workout shirts or under shirts! Keep you cool and dry!,5
B08D6WVXQW,Love these for my boyfriend.Cool and kinda sexy.He feels comfortable in them.,5
B08D6WVXQW,Fits Great,5
B08D6WVXQW,"My Husband loves these T shirts to wear to work under his work shirt , they keep him cool and comfortable they are very thin and light weight. He has been getting them for the past 5- 6 years . Won't wear anything else.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"These shirts are the best! They maintain their softness,  shape and color after washing but I let them line dry.",5
B08D6WVXQW,I would buy it again,5
B08D6WVXQW,Buena calidad y rapida entrega.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Breathable, great for workout and price is unbeatable",5
B08D6WVXQW,"I work in all environments. Mostly outside.The shirts do the job. Worth every penny.Fit is true to size,and don't shrink.",4
B08D6WVXQW,"Comfortable and light, it doesn't help when you out in the sun, but i bet a lighter color other than black would work.",4
B08D6WVXQW,"Great under shirt! Not a compression shirt. Has spandex like material. Fits well around the neck, arms, abdomen. Size runs standard to other clothes.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"I really like these shirts, they are comfortable also.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"The material of these shirts is very nice.  I work out and these fit me very well.  I wear them causally, running and in workouts.  It's a tight weave, they don't let much air through if any, but it is a light material; they don't make me stuffy hot like I have to come out of it in the middle of a run or anything.  They're light enough that I can wear them under a polo at work.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"They are very soft, just got them, but I ordered 2 packs because I needed white mostly and that way I could get 4 white. Problem is they are not both the same white color. I tried to take pictures to show, but not sure you can see it. One is moire a cream white color. We wil wash them and have our son try them and see what happens.",3
B08D6WVXQW,"I've been wearing these for a few months now and I just came back to order more.  These are a great fit, durable, and my favorite part is the neck is very stretchy but returns back to size.  This is key for not messing my hair up after I get it perfect following a shower.  I have many of the name brand and I really prefer these ones.",5
B08D6WVXQW,These shorts are very comfortable and soft. They also have done a great job keeping me cool in the hottest parts of the summer in the production facility I work in. Would recommend.,4
B08D6WVXQW,Should have had 2 blue & 2 black shirts - but ALL are black.Good thing Hubby doesn't mind. ;/,4
B08D6WVXQW,"We have other Cool Pack Crewneck T-shirts from this same brand but they are a thinner material. These are much thicker which is surprising (they are same thickness as some of my Winter base layer long sleeves), but they still work pretty well. Would like them more if they were thinner though!",4
B08D6WVXQW,"These shirts are amazing and really do keep you cool. I use these shirts for work every single day and they hold up to everything I throw at them. Working on a roof, HVAC, Plumbing, general labor. I've found that because they stay close to the body they don't become hazardous or get in the way of my work. They wick away sweat and dry extremely fast. These are seriously the only shirts I wear every single day.",5
B08D6WVXQW,I'm very pleased. Comfortable. Looks great. And does well in the wash.,5
B08D6WVXQW,My husband loves these shirts.  They are so soft and comfortable.,5
B08D6WVXQW,Excellent undergarments that also provide warmth during cold days or nights.,5

B08D6WVXQW,"Absolutely love these shirts. I wear them under dress shirts and they keep me cool. Also, they are nice enough to wear as a casual shirt. Super comfortable and breathable.I have over 10 of them.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"I'm in love with these shirts! The material is so soft and silky, and the fit of the shirts is not too slim but not too bulky. And they aren't extremely expensive like other shirts of this quality and style. I can't recommend them highly enough.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Quickly became my favorite shirts I wear daily but a few of the shirts out of the bag had stitches on the seams missing,3
B08D6WVXQW,Excelente calidad,5
B08D6WVXQW,"I wear these in Hawaii almost daily. Soft, lightweight, moisture wicking.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Fit true to size and they are some comfortable,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Like the title says, this is the perfect undershirt. I have tried out at least 4 different shirts here on Amazon to find the perfect undershirt for me to work and lounge in, and this one is it. The shape fits me perfect (length, tightness), it keeps me super cool (nice wicking), and it's delightfully stretchy. If you want shirts that feel like a million bucks, get these!",5
B08D6WVXQW,"I was gifted a set of these, black in color, and really loved them. I came here to order some lighter colors. I ordered the white and grey shirts in my size of XXL. Upon arrival, I found the white shirts fit well, exactly like the black ones. However, the gray shirts were noticeably smaller and shorter in length, more like size XL. The labels were correct on all the shirts. I will update my review and rating if I hear from customer service.",3
B08D6WVXQW,This is the only brand that I buy for my husband short and long sleeve. He works outside and these are amazing!,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Great shirts. I got a 4-pack of white from Costco that I really like. But white doesn't match my uniform, so I got this pack from Amazon. I like both the navy blue and black, however, the navy blue shirt is only available in a 4-pack with 2 navy blue and 2 black. I wanted 4 navy blue shirts and would have preferred to just purchase 1 pack of 4 navy blue. I am using the black shirts but i didn't need 4 of them.My only complaint is that I would have liked to buy 4 navy blue shirts in a package instead of 2 navy blue/2 black.",4
B08D6WVXQW,"Fits normally (a bit tight as this is a tight fit and not a normal shirt fit (between under armor style fit and a normal t shirt fit). If you want that, go up a size or two.VERY BREATHABLE. It is a mesh like material, bit does not show through. This is great if you sweat a lot while working out and want something to keep you cool and dry off quickly.Seems like it could easily snap, so beware of cats and sharp pointy things.Does not have smell out of the package (I have read this about other clothing purchased online).A little too short to tuck if you have a low waist or above average height/long torso.Overall I would give it a buy for a great gym/workout/sleep shirt.",4
B08D6WVXQW,"Love the shirts but most recent order of pack of 4 and I only received 3. Hence 75% stars. Otherwise, big fan on the fit, comfort and appearance of these shirts.",4
B08D6WVXQW,"Light feel, comfy and breathable. You can see nips super easy, but that's the nature of the light material.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"These have become my favorite Tshirts by far . For years I always bought 100 % cotton. Not any more. These shirts are so cool and comfortable it's amazing. Also , when they get wet they dry fast ! I wear them almost every day and at night they are great sleepwear .",5
B08D6WVXQW,I have painted cars for my living for 39 years. Wear one of these once and you will be sold. Cotton is heavy. Heavier when wet. It breathes! Bullship. These breathe. I feel 20 degrees cooler. I will not wear cotton in summer to work again. These help you stay cool in summer. They also fit very nice and look even better. Try one you will buy 10,5
B08D6WVXQW,Perfect,5
B08D6WVXQW,"What I like:1. Supremely comfortable2. Breathable3. Inexpensive4. Doesn't seem to hold odors.What I don't like:Nothing.These are by far the most comfortable undershirts I've ever worn! I've been rotating the same four pack of shirts for 7 months now, and I work at a hospital. They've been holding up very well, contrary to one reviewer saying they felt very flimsy. They are spandex and polyester, they're going to be very light and stretchy. I've had no issues with mine, and they get washed regularly. I do hang them to dry, and don't use a dryer. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a pack of these again. One reviewer had it right, by saying that they have a good thing, so don't change it. I am 5'10 tall, and weigh approximately 230 lb, and the XL was perfect for me. I like my undershirts only slightly loose, so this fit great. The stretchiness of the fabric took care of the rest. Also, for being polyester, they don't seem to retain odors much at all. So I give them an a+ for that as well.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"The t-shirts are comfortable,  allow you to breathe, and roll up nicely for travel. They are easily cared for (wash in cold water,  dry on medium heat or air dry).  Being a paramedic,  you are constantly working in different environments (freezing cold to insanely hot) and these t-shirts help keep you comfortable. I actually prefer this brand over a higher price below armor brand. My first shirt has lasted 2 years without the neck getting stretched out. They aren't too thick,  wick moisture well,  and  look good as a stand-alone garment. I liked them so much,  I bought 8 more of them. In prefer my shirts a little loose vs the athletic fit and these were just tight for my purpose.",4
B08D6WVXQW,These T shirts are reasonable and great quality and fit and wash well,5
B08D6WVXQW,This is a lightweight shirt perfect for sports. It wicks and keeps you cool.,4
B08D6WVXQW,"These shirt are fantastic and cheap. They are incredibly soft and stretchy, the white resists smudges and stains, and they are very, very cooling. If you are going to Disneyworld in August for example, these are what you want to wear.The only downside to them is they do hold body odors. That's fine if you can change your shirt everyday, but I do have other rashguards and the like that have anti-microbial treatments that basically never hold funk. I'm not going to take a start off for that considering their price and other features, but it would be a very welcome addition. There underwear is the same, something like the Ex-Officio underwear does not hold odors while this material does. Again, they're the most comfortable you'll ever find, but bring plenty if you're travelling. Thankfully, they're incredibly cheat and pack down to nothing, so that's not a huge deal.Yes, I'd buy them again, in fact I already have.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Well  made T Shirts. Cool in the hot weather.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Bought these shirts for our 19 year old son, and he loves them. Bought the XL and he could have worn a L but he likes them a bit loose. No shrinkage after washing and retains it's shape. Great T-shirt! We also bought the black Tees!",5
B08D6WVXQW,"I use these for an under shirt for work, quality and fit are great, and they do keep me cool. It is a light weight shirt and works good for and kinda workout or, in my case, union work",5
B08D6WVXQW,Super comfortable,5
B08D6WVXQW,"A mi esposo le encantan para usar debajo de las camisas del trabajo. Son suaves y comodas, no se arrugan con facilidad o se llenan de motas como pasa con ptros materiales.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"I purchased other similiar tees  for around  $40/ 3 pak. These are less money for 4 shirts. These shirts are ultra soft, very cool, and quick drying. They are the whitest I've ever had. The size  was perfect and there long enough to stay tucked in. I've had them all including bamboo these are the best ever. I will be purchasing more soon.",5
B08D6WVXQW,I got these for my partner becuase he found one of these at goodwill that he has been using it as a night shirt. It's white and has seen better days. This fabric is unbelievably soft. I went on a hunt for soft t-shirts a few months back on Amazon and none of them compare to 32 degrees brand. I'm kind of irritated that I never came across this brand before when I was researching. This is the paramount of softness. My next purchase is going to be pajamas. I'm obsessed with how their fabrics feel.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"I bought these shirts a year or two ago and they were made slightly different with a thinner material, I think the old ones kept you cool a little better being so thin but the new ones still work great.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Comfortable and good looking,5
B08D6WVXQW,"The fit is nice, the quality is good, the look is smooth. Nice Buy!!!",5
B08D6WVXQW,"Great undershirt to keep you a bit cooler, I spend about half my workday outside in Las Vegas and these definitely helped with the heat a bit.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"Comfortable, great fit, and just the right length.",5
B08D6WVXQW,Very good quality material. Better than the ones they sell in costco,5
B08D6WVXQW,They r cool n thin n fit perfectly ..great value they don't shrink..could use more colors in this brand..,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Good fit, no shrinkage, quality seems good.",5
B08D6WVXQW,"what i like about, the quality, and value for the money",5
B08D6WVXQW,"My husband paints houses and he gets overheated in summer, these were the perfect answer. Very breathable and comfortable. Great price too",5
B08D6WVXQW,Very comfortable in the AZ heat at a great price!  Couldn't find these at Costco where I had bought them before.,5
B08D6WVXQW,Wear these as undershirts to upscale events that require a buttoned shirt or similar attire. They keep everything cool to the point of not even noticing the heat (which was definitely not my previous experience).Highly recommend.,5
B08D6WVXQW,"These shirts are awesome. I've had some for several years now, and they really wick moisture away and keep me very comfortable. They hold their color extremely well and are still stretchy after dozens of washings. In fact, I think I will buy some more right now. I am so happy with them!",5
B08D6WVXQW,year 2 and still looks new,5
B08D6WVXQW,Very lightweight and comfortable! Definitely recommended!,5
B08D6WVXQW,"I had bought two different 32 degrees t-shirt versions.  One is called Air Mesh.  It is a very light, thin t-shirt.  Nothing wrong with it.  I have a number of them.  They are fragile but they were also very cheap at Costco. I then bought another version, which was a heavier fabric and was brushed and very soft.  I loved this version and thought this is what I was buying.  But I received the Air Mesh version.  Costco still selling Air Mesh version but I can't seem to find the other type I really liked.",4
B08D6WVXQW,The most comfortable shirts I have. They are now my go-to shirts and I've ordered multiple packs. I did notice the stitching came loose on one but I guess you can't have everything.,4
B08D6WVXQW,"I wear a ballistic vest to work and these shirts have turned out to be great.  They don't hold onto sweat like cotton, cotton blend or under armour type shirts do and they're soft; providing a barrier from the vest and reducing abrasions.  Best part is, they fit like a T-shirt which is exactly what I wanted.  I usually wear a large T-shirt but I ordered an XL because I wanted the added length in the body to keep the shirt tucked in and the added length in sleeves because I hate when the sleeves ride up throughout the shift.  They are thin, so we'll see how well they hold up to weekly washes and they're not warm (but the vest does a fine job of keeping me very warm).  Also, I've only worn them during the winter months so far.  The real test is going to be in the summer.",5
B08D6WVXQW,These feel really good and last,5
B08D6WVXQW,"Love The Comfort Feeling From This Product.  It's Light Weighted And Slick Creating A Comfortable Wear.  It Stretches A Little Bit But Not Very Much.  It Is Quick Drying But The Anti-Odor, I'm Not Sure.  After Several Months, It Does Tend To Absorb The Armpit Odor Even After Several Washes.",4
B08D6WVXQW,Love how light and cool these shirts are! Absolutely exceptional fit and fabric. I'm going back to order them in another color as well!,5
