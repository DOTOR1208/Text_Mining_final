B005MGDP86,"Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt!  I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts.  This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet, in moderation.<br /><br />Why would anyone continue using the ""white death"" table salt that is void of so many essential elements?<br /><br />I also use this to make an all-natural facial and body scrub! We should only ""feed"" our skin what we would put in our mouths!",4
B000HGC96K,All of the other flavors we have tried have been excellent this one isn't.  I wouldn't suggest it.,2
B001EQ4QSG,"The product is great for a quick dinner over rice. However, two of my six cans arrived so badly dented that I could not use them.",3
B002CIL78C,"I ordered a 6-pack of this last fall for about $15, which was a great price, and my toddler loves the cheese powder on popcorn, noodles and broccoli! However, there's no way I'm paying $34 and change for it, and I don't see why the price has more than doubled in less than a year. That's $5.83 for just 3 oz of product!",1
B000UBDKII,I love the coffee pods... And I love the fact that Amazon sells them in bulk.... Thanks...,5
B003VXFK44,I love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole households attention. It's not bitter but it's not light either. It's perfect. I love it.,5
B004ZIER34,"I like my coffee good and strong. I'll pay more for the good stuff. I got a sample of this for my husband.  We both tried it. The flavor is not so great, in my opinion.  My husband said it was ok.  He didn't mention that he felt better after drinking this coffee compared with other coffee.  I'm giving it a couple of stars for the possibility that it would help people that find coffee too acidic. I don' think we will try this again.",2
B000DZFMEQ,"I have tried lots of different bread recipes (GF), you could build a house with most of the results.<br /><br />My first batch of this was a disaster!  Heavy, greasy, I actually threw it away.  Second time around I used extra virgin olive oil, half a cup of rice milk and an extra tsp of egg replacer.  I could not believe it when I looked through the window, I had to move the oven shelf up because the bread had risen 2""!!  If I hadn't have baked the first batch myself I would not believe that it was the same product.<br /><br />I guess it is a good thing I bought a box of 6 because I would definitely not have bothered again.<br /><br />I don't think it is as good as 'proper' bread though, my toddler is allergic to wheat, dairy and eggs, as she is still breastfeeding I have had to give up the good stuff too, hopefully I will be able to manage a bit better with this mix.",4
B0004MTMAI,"this picture totally misrepresents the actual package.  there was no basting brush included.  Also, it ended up being more expensive than I would ever have paid.....never again from an outside vendor",1
B001D3PXZ0,"I like some of the other flavors of Extra Fruit Sensations gum, but this watermelon flavor gum just tastes flat. Flavor only lasts a couple of minutes; much less than the other flavors.",2
B000ODW8JO,Juice inside was all dried up! Nice to find this gum still exists but dissapointing nonetheless. I do not recommend unless you are really feeling nostalgic.,2
B000I6MCYI,"This coffee is tolerable, but not a true ""highlander grogg"". Another reviewer compared it to Kaldi's in St. Louis, which I think is the best Grogg out there, and I have to say I tried this brand based on that review. Boy was I wrong to do that! This is nothing like Kaldi's, and is at best, an imitation of even a mediocre Grogg.",2
B001ACMCNA,"I have been considering going gluten free, due to health concerns and as I am reading the book ""Wheat Belly.""  I purchased this mix to play around with the gluten free thing.  I was rather impressed with the end result, except for one main thing - the instructions say to NOT oil the pan, and as I figured when even the dough stuck to the pan, I was unable to get my pizza off the pan without a big mess.  I did notice that it was a bit easier after it had cooled a bit.  I would think that perhaps some corn starch on the cooking pan may have helped this, but I am not much of a cook and the instructions make no mention of any additional steps.  I also only managed to cook the pizza for about 10 of the 15 minimum minutes, as the cheese was starting to get too brown.  I did however enjoy the taste, which I consider to be quite acceptable as a pizza lover.  It's not a replica of your favorite pizza joint, but for instance I think this wins hands down over the pillsbury refrigerated dough mix!  An added bonus:  I haven't had to sprint to the bathroom after eating it!  I would like more information about the modified tapioca ingredient, and I notice Chebe gives some explanation on its website, but I find it a bit confusing.",4
B000GW46D4,"When I bought this item the first time, I was happy then I ""subscribed and saved"". What a waste! Once they have their hooks in you, they give you the bottom of the barrel. I even gave them a second try the next month and they were all moldy AGAIN. Terrible company. ""Subscribe and save"" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers. Shame on Jack Links. Pathetic.",1
B004A85G52,"Though London Fruit and Herb Company's Blueberry Bliss tea is one of the best teas I have ever had I cannot understand why Amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago! It IS now available through other Vendors (i.e. Wendell Tea Company in MA) but not at the Amazon price.  If is's available to them it should be available to Amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A85G52"">London Fruit & Herb Company Blueberry Bliss Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a>",5

B003V8Y5F4,"My daughter prefers the white cheddar, while the sea salt are my favorites.  They are a good chip alternative when you are trying to live a gultin free lifestyle.",4
B000LKU3WY,"My friend is undergoing chemo therapy and I heard about your product on WGN radio from Steve Cochran who is a fan of this product just for the taste..<br /> It is supposed to also lessen  the effects of nausea with chemo patients.  I asked her if it was working and she confirmed that it took the edge off the nausea after her treatments.<br /> If this is useful to others in chemo, I will be happy to have also suggested it.",3
B000M36L9E,"I purchased this Cola Syrup, and many other to test with my Soda-Club soda making machine. I make many different flavors with it, but I've had a hard time find a Cola Syrup produces the taste of Coke Cola. I've searched the world, via the internet, and I have yet to find a perfect matchup.<br />For me, I consider the this Cola syrup and the Soda-Club Cola syrup to be equals. The taste is about the same. Cost wise, also about the same, as the Soda-Club mix comes in a smaller container that you use less of, but with this Syrup you get a lot more, but have to use a little more for the same results.<br />So in the end, if I am already ordering something else from the Soda Club, then I would just use the Cola syrup they sell, otherwise, I would order this syrup.",3
B00141QYSQ,"My Rottie, with a sensitive stomach, is able to tolerate these treats well.  The best part is she actually has to chew them for a few moments...if you have a Rottwieler you know what I mean.  Any treat is chomped on in 1 second and gone... I feel good about these treats because they seem very healthy for large dogs...although, my daughters Chiauau loves them !",4
B001BIXK7K,"Warning this stuff is hot. Just adding a drop into some pho was too much, but if u like and can handle spice then this is for u, be warned thou!  Enjoy.",5
B0002ITQ9G,I Was very disapointed when received this product because it expires within one month! Company should not sale food like this by mail order. I don't mind pick up something in this situation in store. You know some people don't like to be troubled by send little things back and forth. So that's certainly took consumer's advantage. In the future would be really afraid to buy food products online.,3
B000FPKXK2,"I usually order the Organic Nature Select Applesauce from Gerber, however I thought that this is the same product, only DHA enhanced.  The DHA is derived from Tuna Oil which is not so bad, however it also contains Gelatin, derived from pork, not vegetables!.  The product ingredients above does not state that, and is very misleading.  I didn't notice this until my 3 year old ate 3 containers of it!  I ended up throwing out the rest of the box that was purchased.",3
B00122AMS0,"I can't comment on using this product while you are grilling foods, but when I used this in place of salt in the kitchen, the flavor was disappointing. My hunch is that the cocoa used for coloring affects the flavor, but I'm not sure. I don't know why the cocoa is in there (maybe the color was unappealing without it?) but I wish it was not an ingredient so that I could be sure. I wouldn't care if it was a grey or yellowish salt, take out the cocoa.",2
B000FBM4FI,"My wife like these better that the Swedish version, Wasa, as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product.  We will buy again.",5
B005MGDP90,"We bought this along with the Himalayan Inhaler (which works great).  However this fine ground salt does not work in the inhaler, it comes into your mouth as you breathe.  Use the rock salt instead.",2
B001A47SLE,This makes great iced tea. More flavor than regular tea. Refreshing. Recommend it. Hard to find in stores. Get it here.,4
B0017U50KW,"I used this to make homemade pastrami. Very hard to find locally and online. If you are dry curing meats this is necessary.  Made excellent Pastrami many times next I will have to try Bacon ""the maple Kind"".",5
B0037Z5LKY,"We bought these vegetables to enjoy some delicious Persian food. But, they are full of little dead bugs (inside all of the closed packs of these vegetables) You cannot imagine how I felt when I saw those little bugs inside the boiling water. We bought it from aasanfood.com not Amazon.",1
B002RU3GH0,"I purchased this intending to use it as a skin/hair product.  This smells awful, I should have stayed away from it based on the mixed reviews.",1
B006WJHOX4,"Taste not the original one.<br /><br />Flakes werent crispy.<br /><br />Bad taste.<br /><br />Best before ""Feb 2013"" .. ?  implies that it is an old product.<br /><br />Not happy.. returning it.",1
B000DZKKKC,"I prepared one batch by hand according to recipe using butter.  I baked 1/3 of the batter on glass, 1/3 on corningware, and 1/3 on baking sheet.  The glass batch turned out best.  The corningware batch flattened a little more than the glass batch and also was more crumbling.  The baking sheet ones tasted burnt although they didn't look burnt; the baking sheet ones looked similar to the glass batch but tasted burnt and I threw them out.  I don't know of any other gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix that is also potato free and this one tastes great.  Reminds me of the duncan hines regular glutened-mix but not as good as the recipe on the back of Tollhouse cookies glutened cookies.<br /><br />Another very similar mix I like a little better is Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix which AF just came out with and since Amazon carries AF, hopefully they will carry the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix soon.  The ingredients for them is:  Rice Flour, Organic Granulated Can Juice, Dark Chocolate Chunks (granulated can juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, dextrose, soy lecithin, vanilla), Natural vanilla flavor, salt, baking soda, soy lechitin - Gluten-free Wheat-free May contain milk & soy  To mix add 2 eggs, 3 oz veg oil and 1 oz water.  Bake 10-15min at 375.  The Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie holds together a little better than Pamela's.  The AF cookie has a more buttery taste whereas Pamela's has a more cocoa taste to the cookie.  I think they both get their chocolate chunks from the same supplier as they seemed identical so it is just the cookie part to compare!",4
B002Y1CIYY,They refuse to ship this fine tea to Canada.  I have to go to the Middle East to find it and bring it back.,2
B002LANN56,"Shaggy dog thought this was human food, I think because of the way it looks.  The picture on the bag is pretty accurate - there are meat pieces, veggie pieces and kibble.  He seems to like the taste of it, too. That may be beacuse it is so different from his usual limited ingredient grain free foods. This food agreed with his sometimes testy digestive system,so it's a food we'll rotate into his diet from time to time.<br /><br />Here are the stats: crude protein 28%; crude fat 16% crude fiber 3% moisture 12%<br /><br />and the top ingredients: Beef, soybean meal,soy flour,animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal ---- and the list goes on.  You might want to compare this to the food you currently use for comparison.(the first ingredients are those in greatest concentration in the food)",3

B00412W76S,"The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?",3
B000UZLQG2,"The product itself is great - we love the stuff around here.  That's why it gets any stars at all.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with this is the $10 shipping.  Add that to the product price, and $23.99 takes this off my ""worth it"" list.",2
B0040PWYVO,"We live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices. That said I found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock, if they even stocked.<br /><br />Yes, some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me. I hope the future delivery is the same or better.<br /><br />It is unknown if the can lining is BPA free. I try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it's near impossible to buy canned goods that don't have BPA in the can lining. Pregnant women should avoid anything with BPA in it and if I had growing children I would also strive to avoid.",5
B000LKXJEI,"I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer.",1

B0040WHISG,Would give this a zero if I could.  I spent a lot of money for crackers and I believe some production error happened.  Every single bag was sealed incorrectly.  I should say - not sealed or half way sealed - all 4 boxes only had the hermetic sealing to about 80% - rest was open.  All 4 boxes were entirely inedible.  I was shipped 4 boxes of expensive stale crap.,1
B001LG945O,"A nutritionist once told me she could find something good about every food...except soda. Pop is full of CO2 (carbon dioxide), something our body is trying to get rid of, and refined sugar (which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories). But even so, I still love it. I love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness. Nutri-sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger.<br /><br />For fun occasions, I'll mix lemon-lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful, and slightly healthier alternative to soda. Will the Switch Orange Tangerine soda live up to my expectations? A carbonated juice in a can?<br /><br />At first glance, the Switch can is...cute. It's a slender can with nice artwork. Fun to hold in your hand when you're used to the typical can.<br /><br />But when I taste it, I'm sorry to say, I'm a little disappointed. The Orange Tangerine Switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda, nor as orange juice. For a disclaimer, I'll mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated, so the other flavors of Switch might taste better. I got a kind of odd, bitter taste as I drunk the soda, but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness might be present in regular soda, but this is orange juice (with some others mixed in) and I know how it tastes without carbonation.<br /><br />I gave the Switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste I noticed.<br /><br />So while I won't be happily exchanging my occasional soda for Switch, I'm glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children. And really, on a hot day, this would hit the spot.",3
B003D4OB4G,"This is an excellent choice for summer refreshment. I appreciate the ingredients as they are a healthy alternative to traditional sodas.

B0017U08SQ,doesn't really taste like anything although the noodles have a decent texture. i probably won't order this item again. i tried this company's black bean and lime soup and it was a little better.,3
B005HGAV92,"i was expecting a, packaged,  Tea Sampler package from ""k-Cup"".. not a bunch of single,random k-cups throw into an amazon box. some of the k-cups were damaged and already had holes in them. this is not what i was expecting at all.",1
B004B44ZQ6,"These were my first bully sticks and both my puppy and I were not impressed. The average diameter was less than 0.5"" so thick is pushing it. My dog actually wouldn't even finish the things and they were donated to the neighbor's dog. Ordered other ""thick"" bully sticks from another site and they averaged an inch in diameter and my dog loves them.",2
B001LG945O,I really enjoyed this drink. The tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty. This drink is 100% natural and has no sugar added. The carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda.,4
B000FGXT2A,"Attention, Hooked on Phonics folks. This is the second ingredient listed on the box: ""Organic Evaporated Cane Juice"". Get a LIFE, not diabetes.",1
B00094HIZC,"This product is excellent. At my local store, they struggle to keep enough on the shelves. It is usually priced at $4.99 for 4 bottles, which is expensive as it is. I would try not to spend more than this.",5
B000VHJPKI,"I buy sugar free products a lot, and it is hard to find sugar free barbecue sauce.  I held out hope for this, and indeed did use the whole bottle.  I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please.  I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either.  Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.<br /><br />If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself.  I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too.  However, if you have a choice, choose the other brand(s) first before bothering with this.",2

B008OV91VQ,"At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  ""real""beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.",4
B007OXJK3Y,"I am not a dark roast person typically but apparently I need something richer than this.  The coffee smells wonderful right after it brews, but I don't think that the flavor carries over nor is there much coffee to the brew.  For the most part I feel like I am drinking decent smelling colored water.  This is the first flavored k-cup that I have not loved.",2
B0057QJH6A,"I have been looking for alternatives to made-in-China jerky. Because of - I presume - the amount of meat required to make real jerky, this has been a difficult endeavor. Even product lines like Milo's Kitchen source jerky from China while making the rest of their products - the ones they can process with fillers - in the US. True Chews markets US-made jerky treats but the meat is processed with other ingredients into a jerky-shaped chew that doesn't much resemble actual jerky.<br /><br />Likewise, when I received these treats they were not what I expected. ""Jerky,"" to my mind, means plain, dried meat. I thought the other mentioned ingredients would be added as a coating for flavor, but I expected a largely unprocessed product. In fact it is a cubed, compressed product containing significant amounts of grains and other ingredients as filler. My dog liked them but for the price there are other treats he likes better.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations of a treat labeled ""jerky"" are out of line, but I know a lot of people besides me are looking for a US-made jerky treat, and in my opinion this isn't it. On to Blue Buffalo Wilderness jerky. It is several times more expensive but so far the only ""real"" US-made jerky I have found.",3
B001688BE2,"I have loved making Jiffy Pop since I was a kid and have since made it a point to share the fun with my own 2 children. It is getting almost impossible to find this stuff so I was really glad to find it here. I eagerly placed an order back at the end of July 2008.<br /><br />My order arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. I was super excited to see so much yummy jiffy pop all in one box. Upon closer examination however, I realized that the expiration date was the first week of October 2008. My kids and I love Jiffy Pop but making/eating 24 servings in just a little over 2 months was going to be an impossible task! I ended up giving several of them away to friends and family before they became too stale to eat.<br /><br />So the deal was great and I will likely try again but just be sure to ask about the expiration date before you order so you ensure that you get that great *fresh* Jiffy Pop taste!",3
B000G6RYNE,I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :),5
B002HQLY7S,"My only foray into Gloria Jean's brand of k cups before this one was when I tried the Hazelnut flavor that was included in the sample pack that was included with our new brewer.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.  I'll stick to Timothy's and Caribou Coffee from now on.",2
B003ANFMY8,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever.

B001SIXZPA,"These are pretty good. In my opinion, they aren't nearly as good as the Teriyaki Beef Steak Nuggets (which are sort of similar), but they aren't bad either. They have sort of a prime rip au-jus flavoring, but you can tell that the meat itself isn't prime rib. It's definitely work a try to see if you like it.",3
B001BDDTB2,"My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the ""gravy"". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine.",4

B007RTR8AM,"Something in this shampoo irritates my scalp and skin and I can't use it long enough to find out if the claims of stronger hair are true.  I used it twice and both times after use my head started having a tingling/burning sensation, even after rinsing, and I didn't like it.  There are a long list of ingredients and chemical-looking names that I'm not familiar with.  I was disappointed because I like the easy-to-use bottle style.",2
B0016B7Z32,"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.",2
B004CLCEDE,"Great product, the smell goes away if you rinse, then let it stand in the boiling water for 5 minutes then rinse again with hot water.  The testure is not rubbery.

On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",3

B000EM0JS2,"This is a good soup -- there is no doubt.  The corn, carrots and potatoes are plentiful (no skimping on ingredients in the cans I've tried).  Together, the ingredients make a thick and hearty soup that is perfect for a cold winter day.  I did not feel the need to add salt -- the corn is not bland in flavor and the soup already has a lot of sodium. Moreover, I felt no need to add crackers.  The soup can hold its own.<br /><br />Some posters have noted that this soup has a high level of fat.  It does -- 13g per one cup serving.  Fat, of course, is not bad in moderation.  In my quest for the perfect corn soup, however, I have found an alternative option. It is worth noting here for those who may have particular dietary considerations.  Imagine foods makes an organic sweet corn soup that has 3g of fat per 1 cup serving. The soup comes in a boxed container and is just a corn base.  There are no special flavorings. As a base, it is a good corn soup but when you add several cups of frozen corn kernels (and cooked potatoes if you have the time and desire), you can have a soup just as hearty and delicious as Wolfgang Pucks but with less fat and calories.  This option does require about five minutes more of your time (if only adding frozen corn).  Wolfgang Puck's soup is quick -- in two minutes you have a steaming bowl of great corn soup and you don't have to wait for kernels to thaw.<br /><br />If you are not looking closely at fat (or eat fat it in moderation) and want something quick, this soup is great.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative, I would take a little more time and build a hearty soup using the organic sweet corn soup from Imagine.",4

B007I7Z3Z0,"If you are thinking this ice tea is sweetened with honey only don't buy it.  Yes, it has honey as a sweetener but it's ""honey granules (sugar, honey.)"" As well, other sweeteners are sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt.  These ingredients are not disclosed in the description but they are on the package.  I have no idea how it tastes because I didn't taste it; my preference is not to ingest chemical sweeteners or sugar.  In addition, one 8-ounce serving has 10 mg caffeine; one packet is two servings.<br /><br />I'm only giving this product 1-star because of  lack of disclosure.  When I read the description in the Vine Newsletter I was under the impression this product was sweetened with honey only. This is not the case.  If you don't mind sugar or chemical sweeteners then I suggest you read other reviews about flavor.",1

B00110JI4M,"Okay, first off...if you can't stand regular Kraft Mac-n-Cheese don't bother with this product.  It's a LOT like regular Kraft MnC. It's been made with pasta with 50% whole grain.  Okay, nice compromise there; the 100% whole wheat pastas can be a bit grainy tasting but we know we all need less white flour in our diets.<br /><br />Now, you're discerning 5 year old will probably be able to tell the difference between this and regular Kraft MnC and if he or she is uber-picky about change, demands a certain brand, etc, well, then, this won't fool him.  But my kids ate it up fine.  The 9 year old barely noticed anything different (but she likes WW pastas), the 7 yo who normally doesn't like WW MnC ate it, although could tell it was WW.  The 2.5 year old just kept shoveling it in with his bare hands; I guess that means he liked it.<br /><br />So in a nutshell, this is a worthwhile product to try if you're kids like Kraft MnC.  Same flavor as far as the sauce goes at least.  Same shape of noodles.  The fiber content for a serving of this is a respectable 5g, up from 1g for the tradtional stuff.  Not bad.<br /><br />Of note is the fact that this product has only 6oz in a box as opposed to the 7.25oz in the traditional MnC.<br /><br />For comparison's sake, I usually buy the Hogson Mill 100% WW Mac-n-Cheese.  I found this a bit milder tasting as far as wheaty-ness goes; makes sense as Kraft uses a blend and HM is 100% whole wheat.  My picky eater will eat the Kraft but not the HM.  Hope that helps those of you with similar customers to feed.  I found the Kraft brand in my stores for a little less money than what it's being sold on Amazon for, but it might be hard to find in the stores for many people.",4

The box is substantial - it feels great wrapped up in wrapping paper. Also the Wine-a-Rita people had the foresight to put two different types of recipes on the box: one for wine and one for hard alcohol. Brilliant move in my opinion. My mom is not the biggest liquor drinker, so now she can make iced drinks with wine as the base rather than hard alcohol. Though other reviews state that they only received the drink pouches in a plastic bag, this was not the case for my purchase. I will update this review if we tinker with the recipes.",5
B000G0EP78,"Carbquik delivers exactly what it says: a way to make your food significantly lower in carbohydrates without compromising the taste.

It will only enhance your quality of life ;o)  That being said, it would be beyond foolish to buy this product from Amazon's site. Bear in mind, I'm a HUGE Amazon.com fan and order primarily from them; usually 2-3 times a week as I am disabled and not able to leave the house very often.  I would give Carbquik a 5 star rating, BUT do NOT buy from here as this price is ridiculously high.

I am here, though, to re-order my faves. (This squash isn't among them.)<br /><br />The can is almost all water. It states it serves 4, but there's only enough squash for one.

I was able to enjoy it somewhat by adding my own seasonings and eating it with cheese bread to soak up the oniony water.<br /><br />Yellow squash and sweet onions aren't hard to come by. Cook your own from fresh (try a Southern favorite and make a squash and cheese casserole with a Ritz cracker topping! You'll love it and be so glad you didn't buy this canned yuck.) and save your money for the other Sylvia's items that are delicious. I can highly recommend the Sylvia's Hoppin John.",1

None were listed.  Switch says there's nothing but sparkling juice in the can, no sugar or artificial sweeteners, so that's that.<br /><br />I like the amount of sparkle in the juice, but as a thirst quencher, it was too cloyingly sweet, at least for me. This certainly doesn't mean you might not love it -- I just prefer my sweet with a good dose of tart.<br /><br />Verdict: I'll stick to a good old-fashioned kiwi-strawberry beverage from Snapple or Trader Joe's or Costco.

B002NHYQAS,"For this review you're going to get two opinions.  Darshan1 and chocolate enthusiast extraordinaire, Darshan's Mom.<br /><br />Darshan says:  As an amateur chocolate consumer, I found this fairly similar in taste to Hershey's Special Dark at first, um, chomp, but after a couple chews, I noticed it's a fair amount creamier and much more satisfying than Special Dark.  I favor milk chocolate (I think Cadbury milk is my favorite) so this was a little bitter for me (it actually is a little stronger than Special Dark), but compared to some 82% stuff that my mom sometimes has where I feel like I'm going to choke for the bitterness, this was quite good.  A very good compromise (in my opinion) if we were going to split a chocolate bar for dessert. I like the fact that it's ""Fair Trade"" chocolate since a lot of cocoa harvesting involves some harsh child labor practices, and since it's one of the few fair trade brands that I can get at the nearby regular grocery store instead of having to trek to a gourmet store, I'd probably start buying their milk chocolate variety.<br /><br />Darshan's Mom says:  Newman's Own organic dark chocolate satisfyingly combines the creaminess of milk chocolate with the taste of a somewhat mild, but luscious, dark chocolate.  Since it's merely 54% chocolate, the heavenly, bitter tang of 75% to 8o% chocolate is missing.  However, the rich smoothness of the product almost makes up for that.  Being a confirmed chocoholic, I've taste tested chocolate in France, Belgium and Switzerland, the holy trinity of European chocolate according to a local chocolate store owner, but, in order to be perfectly fair, of course, I've forced myself to sample chocolate in Germany and Italy as well. I've made pilgrimages to American restaurants famous for their chocolate temptations, visited a cocoa plantation in Tobago and prepared numerous chocolate desserts over the years.  So, I think I know chocolate.  Yes, for those of us who crave deep, dark chocolate, Newman's Own comes up a little short, but it is surprisingly delicious nevertheless.  Another plus, it's organic.  If it's priced well compared to the better-known European chocolate bar brands, it could easily become one of my top choices for everyday enjoyment.",4

I, like many, am struggling with celiac's disease, and I've only just found out I have it, so I'm not quite sure what to buy, what's healthy, and what doesn't taste like cardboard.<br /><br />Gluten Free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way, from giving up many favorites, to training your pallet to love these new found grains.<br /><br />Bisquick is Rice based, and is very much like it's original version, however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the T when it comes to these. Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal.<br /><br />Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier **  This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix. YAY for Mom!<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!",5
B001EO5ZFQ,"I love this sauce! I used to get it at my local grocery store, but they've stopped selling it. I just ordered a six pack and it's going to last a good long while. Most people I know that have tried this don't like it, but I find the taste sweet and kind of zippy at the same time. I have been trying to find a substitute for months! I'm so glad I found this on Amazon! :)",5

B004A812VE,"These taste pretty good and are made by a great company in the ol' USA.  However, you have to put the waffle bowl inside of a regular bowl because they are very fragile.

B007MAY97Q,"While the pod I received was of the advertised size, it did not meet my expectations in terms of product quality. The container was quite obviously handmade by someone with no attention to detail and poor metalworking skills, using materials that can best be described as city dump scrap. It is stainless steel, but it's pitted and of uneven thickness. The rolled edges were done very badly and are quite uneven. And while the box is of the specified dimensions, what was not specified is that it is not true-to-shape, making the fit between the top and bottom far less than ideal. In my opinion, this box should be valued at no more than a dollar or two. I think the seller has a lot of nerve offering this as first-quality merchandise.",2
B004F499PE,"Purchased here but later ordered factory direct w/ other flavors I couldnt find here. Very blueberry taste & moist. As a curiosity, I e-mailed a request in regards to spoilage/preserving & got a VERY prepared ,non-answer, statement ""...all natural, blah, blah...."" from General Mills (guess they run the show). When I replied, asking for better info = no response. Never had issues w/ order from Amazon but the later order DIRECT from Lara Bar BECAME COVERED WITH WHITE FUZZ!!!!!!!! I wonder how many bars I ate without looking! Also, if these were factory sealed & fresh, I assume the mold was inside the product from the start! FYI, the mold developed 4 months before expiration date & at stable temps ~ 65-68 deg. I called re the issue & gave them all the info. Sorry .. adv the quality team .. send coupon .. normal reaction. Cust Service rep was going to send a coupon to cover the $ for another. I mentioned the shipping price so she said she would send more. Problem is she sent COUPONS for STORE purchases. Will see how/if I remember to order by mail! No internet credit, etc. No one sells Lara Bars In Central Wisconsin. Also, the coupons she sent wont cover freight & aren't for a 16 count box!!! just a bunch of stuff. This 1-star is for General Mills C/S (kinda stupid) & the mildew/mold.

B005CUU25G,"I received my Lickety Stik bacon flavored dog treat from the Amazon Vine Program, free in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I thought this product was a kind of stick, based on the name of it. Instead it's a flavored liquid in a bottle with a roller ball something like a deodorant applicator.<br /><br />We have a beagle who loves treats and loves to chew.  I thought he would like this treat simply because I was giving it to him.  He did understand that he had to lick the ball to get the flavor, but he wasn't impressed.  Two sniffs, three licks and he was done.<br /><br />I don't think this treat is safe for dogs unless you stand there and hold it for them.  Any chewing on their part will either separate the roller ball from the end and choke them, or their teeth will puncture the container and the liquid will go everywhere.  It's certainly not a treat you can give them and turn your back.<br /><br />I much prefer treats that they can totally eat, and I can't see this ""rollerball"" treat being very popular with pet owners.",3
B003D4OB4G,"I love several of the other Santa Cruz Organic sodas (Lemon/Lime & Pomegranate/Lime are awesome), but I don't care for this one at all. It has a root beer flavor, but something isn't right about it. It has lemon juice in it which seems odd to me, but I think the biggest problem is the low amount of carbonation.  Even a freshly cooled can tastes like it's been left open all day and then put back in the refridge.  The less carbonation works great in their fruity drinks, but not this one.  Also, at a 130 calories per can, you will not get skinny drinking this stuff.",1

I don't think I've ever done that before..<br />It is much closer in taste to a milk chocolate, but even at that lacked any real flavor. There was no depth to this at all, none. It was bland, yet too sweet for dark chocolate, lacking any real chocolate experience at all.<br />If you appreciate dark chocolate, I recommend you check out Chocolove products, or Endangered Species brand.

B004K30HO2,"I purchased this product for a couple of reasons.  First, with the cost of k-cups, this offered a lower price option.  Second, this allows me to used the coffee of my choice (decaf, organic, water-processed).<br /><br />The first couple of times I used these, the coffee was very weak.  I opened a regular k-cup that I had to see if there was a difference in grind size from what I was using; there was not.  Then I poured the contents of the k-cup into my disposable k-cup and it would not fit.  Apparently, the disposable cups hold less coffee, which could account for the weakness.  I also noticed that the disposable cups leak around the rim, and I often get grounds in my cup.<br /><br />I started packing as much coffee as I could into the cups, to where I could barely get the top on.  This made a much better cup of coffee.  However, they still leaked, there were still grounds in my coffee, and it make my Keurig run MUCH slower.  Not to mention the cleanup...<br /><br />My business uses a Keurig so that all of us can brew the coffee of our choice, and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers.  Everytime I use the disposable cups, I have to wipe down the machine, drip tray & my cup.  I also have to clean out the interior of the cup recepticle so that the next person doesn't have to put up with my leftovers.  All in all, these were a nice idea, but the amount of work they require makes paying a little exta for the convenience of regular k-cups more attractive.  I will probably use up what I have and then go back to the regular k-cups or find a more landfill friendly solution.",3
B006N3IG4K,"I'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled.  What you're seeing is a GENERIC ingredient list that covers multiple coffees.  What it is saying, based on the photo I see above, is that IF the coffee type you have is straight coffee, then all it contains is 100% arabica coffee...  But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol",5

B000LKTCVW,"Yea, those who claim these bars are not ""real"" pemmican are right. The original stuff was a mix of dried beef and rendered fat, sometimes with whatever local berries could be found. Even those who ate it regularly hated it. (Mostly voyagers and the like.)<br />Those who whine that this is not real pemmican are clueless. In 1830 or for that matter 2012, meticulously prepared meat-based pemmican still can go rancid. In fact, it WILL go rancid. It was mostly an emergency fall-back ration.<br />Better by far were the old Wilson meat bars of the early '70s. The US military still uses something similar in some of their MREs. Sadly I can find no source for the bars any more.<br />If you make and seal pemmican meticulously with a vacum pump heat sealer they MAY stay eatable for a week in hot weather. I would not count on it. It is also a very pricey item to make, even from scratch.<br />If you want a meat based product that is close to the original, buy one of hundreds of small shelf stable sausages such as salami, pepperoni, summer sausage, etc. Large groceries handle dozens of varieties. I have even seen low fat varieties such as pepperoni. There are also smaller items like Slim Jims and their fellow travelers for smaller meals or smaller appetites. I have seen them in like 3 ounce servings up to eight or so ounces. Beyond that, they get huge. They are all quite fat heavy as was the original item.",4
B000IHJEDE,"There are few foods I don't like, but I couldn't get these down. I can't begin to describe how terrible they taste and how unappetizing the texture is. Unfortunately, I bought them in several flavors and each one I opened was worse than the one before. I begged my co-workers to take them off my hands but no one would eat them. I even offered five bucks to whoever would eat a bag of them and no one could do it -- and I work in an office of cheapskakes who never met free food they didn't like. Don't buy these.<br /><br />If you want a no-carb crispy cheese snack put a thin layer of shredded cheese on a plate and microwave it for roughly 2 minutes. Keep checking so you don't burn it but let bubble up and get crispy. Much much much much much better than these nasty freaky cheese thingies.",1

B000HAAAKI,"Well, it just came yesterday, 100 tea bags of Windsor, supposed to be the best. I made a pitcher of 20 tea bags by boiling the water, boiling again, letting it sit, putting a tea bag in my mouth and sucking and see if it would numb it. No not noticible at all, no wonder its legal in the US, stupid Coca tea! I heard if you put 3 in your mouth and suck on it for a while it will get numb, but I don't feel like doing that. I'm on my 3rd cup of iced tea today and I think I'm gonna just get a sugar-free monstor or drink expresso. Do I feel stimulated? Slightly. Do I feel sober? Yes. Alert? Yes. Energetic? Not particularly, and the fact its 65 degrees in the house doesn't help, I like warmth. Is it real Coca leaves? Yes, but dried and apparently from my research it would take 100 bags to equal 1 gram of coke. Does that mean 100 bags of fresh? I dont know. Why is it legal? Because there are not enough alkaloids in the tea to be considered an illegal substance, kinda like poppy seeds or the essence of coca you will see in the ingredients of coca-cola. It's also known to calm the cravings of cocaine users, although I don't have cravings any way, but if you do it's recommended.<br /><br />I'm now brewing one cup with 3 bags and seeing if I can tell anything...I pour the boiling water on the 3 bags. It has a nice green grassy color, similiar to green tea. It's quite delicious and as I drink it down my mood is slightly lifted, heart beat increases, but no more than with caffeine. Is it like cocaine? No, not at all and if you buy the tea hoping it's going to be that way, you've got another thing coming and will be very disappointed. I knew all this before I decided to try this. I'm not disappointed, yet not entirely enthusiastic about it either.<br /><br />It's a good alternative for thoughs who don't like coffee, it has a vast amount of vitamins, minerals and health benefits and is certainly better for you than caffeine. Also, surprisingly, no jitters like with coffee. Is it like doing a drug? No, not at all, I feel completely sober, yet my spirits are lifted a bit and a slight tingle, but it could be b/c I'm trying to feel something. I can see why it would be legal in the U.S not to mention it helps the trade commission in a safe legal way. And I'm not just saying that to keep it legal, everything I read about it not being anything like a drug has been true. I just didn't know until I tried it.<br /><br />After drinking the entire pitcher I was very giddy, but that was probably just the mood I was in naturally.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not, it's rather expensive. I'll just drink my cuban expresso, I like caffeine better than coca tea.",3

B00113XJQW,"I have a pure breed GSD and had problems for years with upset stomach, eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset.  It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  I have had her on the Evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  It is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  Thank you, thank you EVO!!!",5
B002LANN56,"If you feed your dog Supermarket grade kibble, then this might be a step up for your dog in taste if not nutrition.  Two of my dogs loved it, the third, who has a sensitive stomach, didn't really care for it.  It has nuggets that look like vegetables and others that look like bits of meat although the distinction is purely cosmetic.  The meaty bits are supposed to be tender but they felt as hard and crunchy as the rest of the nuggets.<br /><br />Also, the protein content is pretty high at a minimum of 28%.  I know, we have been told by dog food companies of late, that our dogs crave meat and lots of it.  The truth of the matter is that too much protein can damage your dog's kidneys.  Sadly, we found this out the hard way with our beloved Shiloh.  The pain and expense of having a dog suffer through kidney failure is significant and not something I would want to go through again.  Our vet told us that we should switch to a kibble with a protein content in the range of 18-20% and to get out of the habit of feeding our dogs high protein treats like jerky and pig's ears.  I don't know, but you might want to talk to your vet about it before switching.<br /><br />Now on the other hand, if you feed your dog premium dog food or organic premium dog food, then I would definately not advise switching.  Our vet also recommends organic natural dog food based on a suspected link between preservatives and fillers used in cheaper dog food and certain types of cancer in dogs.  Some articles I've read in various dog magazines have also reported the link between preservatives in dog food and cancer in dogs.  Again, you might want to discuss this with your vet.  Also, FYI I'm suspicious of any vet who tends to only recommend the brand of dog food that they sell at their office.  So, if this happens to you you might want to do your own research on line just make sure your truely getting an unbiased opinion.<br /><br />So anyway, I had been feeding our dogs the ""good stuff"" for several years but my husband would frequently comment (which in guy speak is like complaining) on the doggy food bill.  He ultimately suggested that we give this stuff a try because, after all, Chef Michael feeds it to his dog.  So I tried it and well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this dear but we're switching back to the premium stuff.",3
B002AQP516,"I don't like instant mashed potatoes, but when I came down with a very bad cold/flu and the power went out in Southern California, I was forced to eat Instant Mashed Potatoes and these weren't bad tasting at all they were pretty good. So I decided to keep them on hand for emergencies and for lazy days.<br /><br />I still love homemade mashed potatoes. But these are good to have as a standby.",4
B001GVIT14,"I bought a small package from a local store because it was sitting with all the other luxury coffees like Kona or Blue Mountain, but for a quarter of the cost.  I hope I don't make that mistake again. I use a french press to make my coffee and my favorite coffees come from Kenya, Ethiopia and Hawaii.<br /><br /> Maybe I got a bad batch, maybe I am doing something wrong, or my tastes are different, but this coffee tasted weak and lifeless. Thinking I just made it too weak, I used more coffee the next time.  I got some of the flavor I was looking for but it was overpowered by an acidic flavor.  So I cut it with milk and it improved, but it still just doesn't taste how I think a fine coffee should.  I shouldn't have to go through all that to get a drinkable cuppa joe. Yes this coffee is not very bitter, but removing an entire element of flavor from this coffee just ruined it.  I like very dark chocolate because of all the different interesting flavors, fruity, spicy, sweet, and it's slightly bitter- but in a good way.  That is how coffee should be.  This coffee is like milk chocolate. It is overly simple, hardly bitter and some people are bound to like it that way.  To me, it lacks the flavor I look for.",2
B0089SPDUW,"This morning, for the first time in my life, I tried Mahogani Caribou Coffee only because I had run out of my usual type of coffee, which I would usually brew and drink. In short, I should not even categorize Mahogany Caribou as coffee!!!! You know why? It has far more anti-depressant and uplifting effect on me than I had previously anticipated. From now on, I will only drink Mahogany Caribou.",5
B001FA1MF6,I opened a can and it smelled like cigarettes which I was informed was bad bacteria.  I reported this to Amazon whom I got it from and they sent me another 6 pack for replacement BUT it also smelled badly...At this point I gave up trying. I am all for organic but this stuff was poor in my opinion.  Allot of it seemed like hard rice and it smelled like cigarettes and bad bacteria.  I wouldn't buy it again.,1
B002GWHF76,"So okay, I don't do hot tea; BUT this is a perfect loose leaf tea for iced tea.  Am I an expert at Ice Tea?  No, but after moving to the South some 25 years ago, I have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere.  I will say that most recipes I could find must have been for some cheap tea bags (weak, somewhat tasteless and bitter), so I experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea.  The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  If you are in a hurry, fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice.  This works great for this particular loose leaf tea - not strong, not weak.  Oh yes, if you like sweet tea, add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot.",5
B002IEZJMA,"I really wish I knew what was up with this country and sweeteners.  These days you can barely get a cup of coffee somewhere without someone dumping sugar into it without asking.  So along comes Illy's ready-to-drink ""espresso-style"" coffee and I imagine I should have guessed that it would be sweetened.  I didn't.  It was an unpleasant shock,not only because I hate sugar in my coffee, but because you have to check the ingredient list to find the sugar. Okay, fair enough, you should look at the ingredient list on everything you put in your mouth, but it should also say ""pre-sweetened"" on the front of the can. I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />All that aside, and making an honest attempt to evaluate the stuff in spite of the sugar, I'd have to say that it's a good, smooth, tasty brew.  I've always liked Illy coffee and this brewed stuff isn't half bad for something that comes out of a can.  I think I'd prefer it from a glass bottle, but what are the odds of that happening? As it is, the flavor of the can isn't a huge problem, but it sure doesn't add anything to the experience.<br /><br />Tiny can doesn't go very far either.  Presumably the reason why Illy has produced a ready-to-drink brew is for people who want to grab a can out of the fridge and swig it down.  If they're going to heat it... well no, I don't even want to think about that.  Ugh. So it's meant to be drunk cold.  Twelve ounces would have made more sense in that case.  This isn't a tiny cup of hot espresso we're talking about, it's a cold beverage. If Illy is going to bow down to the Sugar Gods of America, they can darn well do a bit of homage to the Gods of Conspicuous Consumption, too.  But $2 for less than 7 ounces of coffee?  Thanks but no thanks as Sarah Palin famously remarked.  @2 for a 12 oz can is still a bit high, but more acceptable overall.<br /><br />So kudos to Illy for using sugar instead of HFCS, but points off for using any sweetener at all.  Good flavor and body, but cans just don't lend themselves to a good coffee-drinking experience.  Cans are too small and the price is too high.  Buy a tin of Illy and brew your own.  It'll taste better and you'll save money.",3

B002IEZJMA,"For reference, my ""morning coffee"" is a doubleshot of espresso, hot and very lightly sweetened with brown sugar in the winter, unsweetened over ice in the summer.<br /><br />This morning, I had this, first on its own (ick), and then over ice (slightly better). There is no part of me that's tempted to replace my morning routing with a can of this, easy as it might be.<br /><br />Really, it wasn't horrible. It tasted an awful lot like the other big brand's version of this, which, unfortunately (and I know this sounds horrible), tastes to me like, well, like coffee smells when it's exiting the body. Maybe this is just me, but it's something of a turn-off, and is true for both that other brand and for this one.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy the texture of this drink, either -- kind of syrupy and thick, when it seems like without cream it should be pretty watery. It was also waaaay sweeter than I would ever want my coffee to be, but given that I generally prefer an unsweetened cold coffee, I'm not sure how much stock you want to put in that.<br /><br />Overall, if you like that other brand's version of this product, I don't see why you wouldn't like this, but if you're hoping for something better -- I don't think this is it.",3

B003CK2BQG,"It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.",4
B003VXFK44,I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.

B000LKUAK4,"The seasoning is good, but the texture is not to my liking; it's almost spongy, and microwaving did not improve the texture for me.

They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber. There are lower calorie veggie jerkies available, if that is a concern for you.",2
B001ET5Y5C,"First of all, this was a LOT of tea.  Two large boxes (each over 10"" x 6"" x 4"") that contain a ton of tea bags, each round and filled with a generous amount of tea.  The boxes weigh about 28 ounces each, more than listed.  That's 3 and a half pounds of tea.  And the steeped tea is a nice rich orange color.  And, with regret, I just threw out one unopened box and and the remaining 2/3 of the bags of the other.<br /><br />Why?  Because although the tea starts out tasting rich and good, it turns foul and bitter after several minutes.  At least it does when mixed with moderate amounts of sugar and fresh milk.<br /><br />Although Orange Pekoe refers to a GRADE of tea, having to do with the size of the broken up leaf particles, in North America it is generally thought to refer to the COLOR.  Orange color in tea is a result of oxidation of the tea.  And this tea must be really oxidized, because it does have a rich orange color that appears remarkably quickly, after steeping for as little as 45 seconds.  I've never run across a tea that steeped more quickly.  In an effort to avoid the bitterness that develops, I tried quicker and quicker steeps, and even experimented with cooler water.  But nothing helped.  If steeped too quickly, it just tasted thin and yucky.  I guess there is such a thing as TOO oxidized.<br /><br />Too bad, because the initial taste is good and you sure get a lot of tea.  But unless you drink a full cup in about two minutes, you won't like the taste that develops.",1

B000633V3O,"I was very excited to try this food.

I only wish I hadn't mixed the dry food with another high priced food because now I'll have to toss all of it. I had also purchased some of their canned food.

B004YV80OE,"In the time it took to make this product, I could have made a much healthier and better tasting dinner from scratch. I was never a big fan of Velveeta cheese, but decided to give this a try. I had to laugh when I read from another reviewer that this product contained broccoli dust, because that is honestly the best description I would be able to think of. The instructions are pretty lame, because it says to brown the chicken, but it doesn't say to add any fat so the chicken doesn't stick to the pan. I added a tiny bit of oil, so it wouldn't stick. The taste was nothing in comparison to a homemade meal. I think it had a kind of chemical taste to it, with a gross after taste. My 18 yr. old son wouldn't finish what I put on his plate, and that surprised me, because he eats just about anything, but he is also used to homemade food, and didn't expect to get served this kind of meal. Even if I browned some cut up chicken, and then added some water, real cheddar cheese, heavy cream, pasta and some frozen broccoli and let it cook for the same amount of time that this product calls for, it would have been better tasting and a lot healthier, so I would pass on this one... for sure.",2

But, I had some jalapeno flavored peanuts a week or so ago that were delicious.  Black pepper while it gives these a little kick is not enough for a real spice lover.  It does kind of sneak up on you after you've had a few though.<br /><br />BTW, the nuts are also flavored with sugar, citric acid (adds a touch of tartness, I think) onion, ""spice"" and ""natural flavor"" in addition to the sea salt and black pepper.  You can definitely taste the sugar, onion and the citric acid (kind of a citrus twang- not a lot, just a hint)  That's something I would have liked to have known before purchasing.  But the taste that comes through is the sea salt and black pepper.  Actually quite a bit of black pepper. After trying them over again, I don't like them as much as at first.<br /><br />If you're looking for real cashew flavor with just a hint of spiciness, these are OK- not bad at all.

My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast, so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.<br /><br />While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma, it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best, a perfect cup, in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests, who thought it was just okay.<br /><br />So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay, but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind, which I like, but the bean is not very dark. The brewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend, give this a try.",3
B000E1HUXK,"My daughter was put on the orange goodstart at birth.  But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can.

Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty???

B000FF3L6U,"As sugar-free gums go, this gum is awful.  The taste dissipates in no time, and the gum itself is far from elastic.<br /><br />Yet I still buy it.  Why?  Because it uses only XYLITOL as its sweetener, a substance that actually reverses tooth decay (minor reversal, mind you, but, well... I'll take anything).  It's actually GOOD for teeth.<br /><br />Other gums on the market that taste better have XYLITOL as an ingredient, but they also include other sugar-free sweeteners.<br /><br />Here's what Wikiipedia says about XYLITOL:  ""Xylitol is a 'toothfriendly' sugar. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries. Recent research[7] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then ""starves"" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption.""<br /><br />On top of all this, XYLITOL might actually improve bone density.<br /><br />Taste?

B0062A87HA,"When I ordered this organic pumpkin product, there was a problem with customers receiving dented cans. Amazon/Farmer's Market Foods was assessing the situation to resolve this problem, and the pumpkin was not being sold. When, I assumed, they had finally resolved the dented cans situation, I was able to order.<br /><br />I received the case of pumpkin puree and the box seemed really well packaged, so I was surprised to find all but 2 of the 12 cans DENTED. I'm almost certain the problem is occurring at the manufacturing plant, because the cans in the middle of the case were all dented. Be informed the problem is not resolved, yet.<br /><br />I went ahead and used the pumpkin from a dented can as there was no indication the product was tainted (Push on the top and bottom of the can. If the top or bottom of the can moves in any way or makes a popping sound, the can's seal has been broken and air has made its way inside). The pumpkin tasted fresh and had a very succulent, moist consistency and it is organic. I would definitely recommend this brand of pumpkin IF they resolve their dented can problem, especially since you can't find pumpkin in the grocery stores at this time (due to the destroyed pumpkin crop in the Fall of 2009).",4

If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.

B0059WXJKM,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",1

I had thought this would be a product I'd enjoy as mango and pineapple are two of my favorites when it comse to fresh fruit or smoothies; I've also been a Lipton tea customer for years, and have never been disappointed in their products. I even enjoy honey on occasion as a more natural sweetener, and was curious to see how these flavors would combine.<br /><br />This one was such a disappointment that I gave away what was left in my sampler box (my friends and family didn't care for it either). Now I liked the convenience of the stix, and have appreciated what companies have done in order to give you a somewhat cheaper form of ""flavored water"" so I thought Lipton might have had something.<br /><br />The honey was so prominent and overly sweet that it pretty much wrecked the remaining flavors; it also had a slight chemical tinge which left me with a horrible after-taste in the end. What there was of the mango and pineapple was not the fresh taste I had hoped for, but something with a disgusting artificiality that did not play up a combination which does work very well under most circumstances (such as when I've made up my own mixture); again there was way more artificial sweetness (and this is coming from a Southern girl who loves sweet iced tea on occasion). Even the fragrance was sickening and overpowering. The color in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water was a straw-yellow -- not quite golden, not quite regular yellow, but I figured that meant it would be strong enough to give me the full flavor I desired without being too weak. As I mentioned, I could only take several sips; I think I drank 1/3 of a bottle in the end...and then I called it quits. I even refrigerated it for a bit, as if hoping everything needed time to ""merge""; after a few hours I tried again -- lost cause and down the drain it went.<br /><br />I don't know if the other flavors are an improvement, but I will never waste money to find out.

B002FBY1UW,"I am definitely in the middle of the fence regarding this product. :-(<br /><br />The good:<br />* Non-BPA packaging (as we all know, almost impossible to find for a plain tomato product)<br />* low in sodium<br />* not sourced in China<br /><br />Now for what I consider the downsides (other than the price, which may not be a deterrent to some).<br /><br />First, compared to the no-salt-added product I used to use (Del Monte Petite Cut Tomatoes, No Salt Added), I do think these tomatoes have FAR less taste. The difference is not due to salt content because the sodium content as given on the packaging of both products is the same. IMHO the Pomi tomatoes taste less ""tomato-y"" than what I used to buy (a friend who also tried the Pomi said she finds the taste ""insipid""). But that is not my main gripe.<br /><br />The package claims 26 1/2 oz net weight (approximately, but close enough). However, a LOT of that weight is the watery juice from the tomatoes and thus I was unpleasantly surprised to see how little of that 26.46 oz is actually TOMATOES. So one day I took the time to strain the package and see exactly how much chopped tomato there is, versus their juice. The strained chopped tomato pieces were weighed on my electronic kitchen scale and came to 13.4 oz; the juice which was strained directly into a measuring cup came to just below the 11 fluid oz mark. Also, some of that 13.4 oz of chopped tomatoes also included a little bit of juice as well, since they were impossible to drain completely ""dry"". So this means that for the current price ($2.50 per box of Pomi at my local supermarkets) you are getting only about 13 oz of chopped tomatoes. That comes to about 19 cents per ounce. Hmmmmmm.<br /><br />This made me curious enough to invest in a ""throwaway"" can of my former choice, the Del Monte Petite Cut tomatoes which comes in a 14.5 oz can, to see how they compared. I strained it in the same manner as I did the Pomi. The results: I got 12 oz of actual tomatoes and only 2.5 oz of their juices. The can of Del Monte was $1.29 (at the same large supermarket chain that sells the Pomi for $2.50) which comes to 10.7 cents per ounce... almost half the cost of the Pomi if you are calculating how much actual chopped tomatoes you get for the money.<br /><br />I must also comment that the consistency of the Pomi chopped tomatoes is much ""mushier"" than the Del Monte petite cut or other typical canned ones ... in fact, IMHO the Pomi chopped is more than halfway to ""sauce"" consistency right out of the box, which is okay for some recipes but not good for others. The Del Monte diced served me perfectly in that regard but again... that darned BPA in their cans! :-(<br /><br />I really DID want to love the Pomi chopped tomatoes and if it was only the taste and the consistency that disappointed, I could probably learn to live with those shortcomings. However the realization that they cost almost twice the price for approximately the same quantity of ACTUAL chopped tomatoes compared to the equivalent canned product, is very frustrating especially in today's economy. Because I usually need little or none of the juice which makes up more than 35% of the package's contents, basically I'm paying a 90% premium for the non-BPA packaging.<br /><br />There should really be a better alternative but I've yet to find it. The few tomatoes in glass jars that I have found, have all contained spices (which I can't use, being allergic to garlic and onion) or have high sodium contents. Ideally, I wish Pomi would add a straining step to this product (which perhaps Del Monte does?) so that their package would contain more tomatoes and less liquid.",3
B002IEZJMA,"I split this can with my work associates to get a more balanced view.  A dark coffee fan, a sweetened coffee fan and myself (Somewhere in the middle). All of us agree.  This is a very bitter coffee flavor.<br /><br />The sweetened coffee fan really didn't like this so if you are the type that puts sugar in your coffee - this is probably not the flavor for you.  The dark coffee fan and I enjoyed it more, but we agreed that the dark flavor is full but a little bitter.<br /><br />It's just going to come down to if you like your coffee sweet or not.  Sweetened coffee drinkers are not going to like this much... but if you like stronger coffee this may be just your thing.  This is a very strong flavor for a very bold coffee lover.",3
B006N3IG4K,This is our first time trying the Wolfgang Puck coffee - so glad we did!!!  It is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day!  I would buy it again!,5
B000GZYAN2,"I usually buy real brownies, but these intrigued me so I wanted to try them. I could tell they would be too sweet for me after licking the batter spoon and I was put off by all the cocoa dust that flew out when I dumped the package. They were easy to make though and cooked just fine in cupcake liners. They made about 12 cupcakes. I ate maybe 3 with LOTS of milk and then dumped the rest in the trash. It's not that they taste horrible, it's that they taste absolutely nothing like real brownies. They taste like dark chocolate and sugar goo, in my opinion. I can't stomach diet drinks or anything made with beet sugar or fake sugar either, so I'm not surprised that I hated them.<br />I just realized that, to me, they taste very much like Snackwell's devil food cookies. I never liked those, but I know plenty of people that did.",3
B001EQ55ZO,"These are the most unique nuts I've ever tasted. The product description says ""light"" salt and pepper, but that is not my experience. Quite salty, quite peppery, quite intense flavor. I liked them, being a lover of salty things, but a couple people I shared them with found the flavor overpowering. The container is very cool and portable, so it's great for work or sports events.",3
B0045TK3PO,"I bought this as an alternative to the regular version of Pillsbury cake mixes and while it tasted fine, I did suffer from horrible gas and stomach pains.  I ate only the recommended amount, but the problems last a couple of days.  I am not saying this will happen to everyone who tries this product, but my husband and myself won't dare eat this cake, nor the sugar-free frosting again!",1
B007JFMH96,Only 4 stars because I don't think they are worth $1 for each cookie. The grandkids loved them and so did the adults. Plenty of chocolate to have some in each bite but not as many almonds as I would have liked. They were moist and chewy and tasted like they could have been homemade. Tasted fresh. I think the price is in the individual packaging inside the box.,4
B00141UC9I,I like the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Breast because of the quality and lack of chemical additives. And both my cat and dog would eat only this if they could. Ordering auto ship saves even more from Amazon's discount pricing.,5
B0062MEOTI,"I'm not usually a big peppermint fan, but am a lover of the peppermint mochas that starbucks has seasonally. However, since the calories in those are so high, I got these to cut down on how many trips I made to the coffee shop - and on the cost.  Pretty darn good, and definitely much lower in calories, sugar, and fat in comparison to the originals. Still not as good as the original, but it helps cut the craving down :)  Good cost cutter, option, too, as long as you buy them either direct from the Tassimo company online, or from a place like BB&B (bed, bath...). The price here, if for only 1 package is ridiculous. Twentyfive? Ten is more of the standard pricing.  I believe BBB offers free ship online for single serve coffees like this, too.  Tassimo often does sales and always does free ship over 50 buckaroos.  If you sign up for emails from Tassimo, they often send out deals and sales on their stuff, too.<br /><br />There were a couple of cons, though. One is that they only offer the Peppermint Mocha seasonally, so that may be part of the high cost here on amazon right now.  The second downside is that there was a bit of a chemically aftertaste.  Nothing horrible, but definitely noticeable.",3
B00141UC9I,"My dogs all love the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Chews, they can't wait to get them and know where I keep them, they go straight to the cupboard where they are stored.

B008O3G25W,My dog is small and loves loves treats. But treats she can toss in the air and run around with. She couldn't get the idea this was just a taste. She really thought at some point I would give up and give her the bottle. I am passing it on to a friend who is trying to train her dog not to pull on the leash. I realize this is a training tool but my dog didn't seem to think so. She did like the taste.,3

B002LANN56,"I admit, I have a picky little terrier/mix and so she can't bark for all dogs, but she did not care for Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin at all.  She is used to the chunkier, moist food, so maybe that's the reason.  I poured some in her bowl and she sniffed of it, looked at me, and then walked away.  The food sat in the bowl all day.  She didn't eat any of it.  I felt guilty after awhile because she just refused to eat it.  But, I let it sit there.  The next day, she still hadn't eaten any of it.  Knowing she must be very hungry, I got rid of the Chef Michael's and gave her some of her usual food.  She scarfed it right down.  So, for my dog anyway, I can't give this dog food a great rating.  Sorry.",3
B000CQ4D3C,"I give this product two stars because there are no artificial ingredients and it is 75% organic. That is all it has going for it.<br />I'm trying to go ""all natural"" and ""organic"" with all my purchases. I saw this for about $5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version (which is far from ""all natural"") I bought it.<br />Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes. I did not time it, but it was more than two minutes. My son would not eat it. I made myself a package. It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.<br />I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.<br />This product was a big fail in my household.<br />This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like.

B000J2DQ46,"We had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average.  Warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and/or butter to blend in with the soup mix. We found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional, even with as little as 1/2 cup of added whole milk.<br /><br />The package of six cans contained three dented cans.  Two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed.  For this reason, we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail.",3

B001LGGH40,"Switch Kiwi Berry Soda:<br /><br />First thing you notice is the light pink color of the soda. It is very lightly carbonated as there are almost no bubbles, yet it is carbonated. It has a pleasant aroma, light yet fruity.  Its taste is also light but sweet. Fruity with definite berry overtones.  There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but I notice it. The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans. I on the other  hand find myself often spilling out a few ounces of soda so there may be less waste overall, for me.  As in the other flavor I sampled (Watermelon Strawberry) Kiwi , Raspberry and Strawberry are mighty low in the list of juices in the soda. Still I find this flavor far more palatable than the other. I give it 4 stars and find it an acceptable fruit soda.",4

I am dinging them one star because their serving size is 21g or 2 tbps. I found that 21g came out a bit over 1 tbps, but it is definitely not 2! Since most people are likely buying this to watch their calories, that's a big error. You still end up with enough to comfortably cover a piece of bread.",4

They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.",5

I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.",2

B00283V4GQ,"Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.",4

The smell wasn't bad like most dog treats and while my husky didn't stop to smell the roses, or rather, the treats, my chow mix did.  A couple of sniffs and then the treat disappeared.<br /><br />If I could change anything with the treats, I would love for them to come in a single bite instead of two biscuits together.

B000F9Z1WI,"I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.",5

B000ES3LMC,I spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great Earl Grey... to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to London with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags. i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then.<br /><br />The tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag  which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea's.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is a nice Bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in. i perfer mine strong and straight up. each sit is as good as the first. i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of London,5

B00016UX0K,"This is the best Sweet Chili sauce I have found anywhere. Some say its to sweet but hey, it's a Sweet Chili sauce and its supposed to be sweet. It has a rich full flavor that everyone in my family likes. Even my wife who can't stand anything anyone would consider hot just loves this sauce. I'm a pepper head myself. If you're like me and like a little more kick try adding some Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to this and you will learn to love it too.",5
B0036FOV2O,"These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag.",2
B00389Q4XW,"My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial, in fact the quality is great. We will bring this camping for the younger kids. With the powders we always had clumps, this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff!",5
B00132UY8W,"I bought these based on my previous purchases of other India Tree products that are naturally colored, i.e. artificial dye free.

Unfortunately, we cannot use them as my daughter is allergic to artificial dyes and the company will not accept them as a return. $11 for nothing :(",2

B002TMV3E4,"I've tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasn't been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose that's something.  I'm a moderate coffee drinker- I like 1-2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta ""Riviera Sunset"" decaf is smooth and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands.  The flavor is great and I've enjoyed it both hot and iced.",4

B001650VTI,"I ordered the chai tea latte it is ok in a pinch, but I like the sugar free the best. So it is hard for me to judge the product. It does not have the same taste as sugar free. So I give it 3 stars. thanks Mary.",3
B0041QD39O,"Hmmm, where to start.  It's a really, really good cup of coffee.  It definitely deserves 5 stars, no doubt, happy to drink it, would be proud to serve it to my guests.  Perhaps best called caramel finish, not sweet caramel finish - might need a little turbinado sugar to get the sweet part.<br /><br />I do not think it is better than the Cafe Altura Dark Roast Columbian sold by Amazon in 32oz bags.  I would consider them equals, but the Weaver's is not better, and you get more coffe for less money with the Cafe Altura.<br /><br />I'm sure being called the ""Best Organic Coffee"" on the NBC TODAY Show was a good shot in the arm for sales, but I sincerely doubt that they are ""the new standard in artisan coffee.""  I think of coffee like Italian restaurants in New York/ New Jersey.  The great ones have endured, and everybody knows where to go for great Italian food.  But, when everybody is making the same stuff really well, what you're left with is your personal preference.  Weaver's is lucky to have some devoted coffee drinkers, but they're not a new standard by any stretch of the imagination, way too many people growing & roasting great coffee for that.",5
B002DVVP6W,Probably my favorite of the Somersaults Snacks.  They taste like a combination between a salt and pepper chip and nuts.  Their substantial crunch and texture make you feel like you've really eaten something after only a few.  I like to keep some in my purse for those mid-day cravings when I'm out and about and need a snack to keep me going.,4
B002IEZJMA,"I really like coffee, but overall I would rate this as ""okay"" tasting - it is very strong, and has a bit of a bite in the flavoring that made me get a piece of gum to get the taste out of my mouth.  After a couple of sips, I was done and would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I opened this can up in the office, and passed around small sampler cups to my co-workers to get their thoughts as I work with several coffee connoisseurs.  Three women and one man said they thought it was good, and the three women would rate it a 4 on a 5 scale while the man said he would rate it a 3..<br /><br />Another man who typically buys and enjoys the Starbucks canned beverages said he would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Including myself, none of the test subjects hated it but everyone said the same thing - while they thought it was good, none of them believed it was ""good enough"" to make them want to go out and purchase some.  When I asked why, they had the same impression I had in that the coffee place downstairs was better none of us were really compelled to add this to our regular routines and shopping lists.<br /><br />One thing to note is there is a lot of sugar in this 6.4 ounce can: 10g!  The sugar and the caffeine combined should give you a little kick in the afternoon if that is what you are seeking.",3
B0041NYV8E,"I wasn't for sure what a warm ginger flavored product would be like, but I wanted something with lemon for fighting Spring allergy symptoms.  Often during the Spring I get sore throat & congestion issues - the best remedy is warm liquids.  Since high caffeine drinks like tea & coffee are not ideal for nighttime, then I've explored many lemon based drinks like this to use.  I can say among those I've tried this is not as lemony as many of the others and the ginger taste is a little overwhelming.  I like ginger ale and eat ginger flavored items, but as a drink this was a little much.  If I was sick, this might help but the taste would make me not want to finish a whole serving.  So all and all, make sure you are a fan of the spiciness of ginger - this is key for knowing whether Gold Kill's Ginger & Lemon Beverage is right for you.",3
B0018OL46G,"I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer. My pet is crazy over this treat! I would have given this product five stars because my puppy loves it and it's highly nutritious (as claimed by the manufacturer). But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas. It doesn't bother him but it does me! When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence.",2
B001EQ4P2I,"I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it ""BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game"" flavor and it would have been more accurate.",4

B002DHN956,The granola bars are pretty decent. They bars are lightly honeyed so it is not too sweet but still sweet enough. The bar is well textured and contains bits of nuts with the flax. 72 bars of it might be a bit much but it is definitely manageable as it lasts a decent amount of time.,4

B001FA1L7U,"I remember well the ""Beer Nuts"" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'",2

They were paper thin amd broke apart in to smaller pieces way to easily.. These were definately a cheap poor imitation of the ones I recived before.. I will throw away the remaining 3 to avoid further probelms with my dog chocking on the small pieces..... Stay away from this seller.......",1

B004X3VRLG,"Not sure what the problem was, but neither of my dogs accepted these treats if an option was available.  If this was the only thing offered, they seemed to take them with a disinterested attitude.  They were made in such a way that the dogs didn't devour them in a few seconds, so were long-lasting, and were a good size to take up some time when you want something to occupy your dog for a longer amount of time.

B004MO6NI8,"No Fear has soy in it.<br /><br />The initial flavor in this was not too bad.  I don't know that I have ever liked one on the first try - even my favorite sugar free Red Bull.  The initial flavor wasn't too terrible, but then it had a sour aftertaste.  It has a seriously chemical flavor to it and a slippery, kind of oily, feel to it - kind of like pouring gasoline in kool-aid.<br /><br />The problem for me was the excess carbonation.  Take a drink, burp.  Take a drink, burp.  Not something to drink in polite company.<br /><br />Then there is the sugar and the serving size.  I don't know why manufacturers say that 16 oz is 2 servings.  Maybe so that we think there are 130 calories?  There aren't.  There are 260 calories. That's more than my morning omelet.<br /><br />In any case, I wouldn't buy a case of any energy drink without trying one first.",2

B005BPVE90,"These oatmeal raisin bars are purported to be healthy nutrition bars. There is really nothing healthy or nutritious about these ""Eat Think Smile"" bars. They are high in calories (200), fat (8g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either. The claim is that because they contain cocoa (chocolate) they are good for you because chocolate is supposed to be an antioxidant. That is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven. The only ingredients that might be healthy are the raisins and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog's Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these ""Eat Think Smile"" bars. The claim is that these bars are a smart choice! If you are starving and only alternative is eating dirt, the dirt might be a healthier choice actually. I really dislike companies that create this kind of ridiculous untrue hype about any product.<br /><br />These ""Eat Think Smile"" bars are basically cookies and that would be ok if they tasted good but they don't. They have a gritty texture and taste overly sweet.

B002PI82P0,"This is my second Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It's the lowest priced model available and is pretty good considering the price. The lack of extra features is not a problem. However there are some issues you might like to know before buying. Overall, it makes a decent espresso at the touch of a button. It's easy to clean and maintain and for that alone it's worth it since it saves you so much time.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso is decent - not bad, but not great either. It's far superior to drip coffee and easier than grinding your own beans. It took about a week to get the dosage and grinder settings to where I was satisfied. The defaults didn't use enough beans and the grind was too course which made the espresso quite bitter. You don't want run too much water through the grinds once the initial flavor is extracted.<br /><br />The temperature of the espresso is a little low. It's fine if you drink it right away or don't add cold milk. The only other little issue is the frother dispenses quite a bit of water before the actual steam. Therefore you have to use a second cup and run it for a few seconds until the steam flows consistently, then switch to your milk so you don't dilute it. Not a big deal but my last machine didn't require this step.<br /><br />Finally, the last issue has to do with the horrible packaging. The main box is contained in an outer box that's almost twice its size. The problem is there was NO PADDING whatsoever in the outer box, so the inner one is left to get slammed around throughout its entire shipping journey. My machine become separated along the main seam that runs all the way around the unit so it didn't even close properly until I pushed it back into place - there's still a small crack on one of the plastic pieces. Also, some of the buttons popped off. I would have returned it but it's kind of a hassle to ship something so large and it still works okay, so not a big deal, but wouldn't order one from here again.<br /><br />The bottom line is Super Automatic Espresso makers are an amazing convenience for those who appreciate fresh coffee. The quality is much better than the pod makers and far easier than grinding your own beans and making a whole pot at a time. The espresso isn't as good as a manual machine and this model doesn't have any fancy features, but still an amazing value for the price.",3

Each bag also has a little story, courtesy of Uncle Ray, that usually has some moral message or anecdote. They are pretty funny, but not intentionally. My only problem with these chips is their texture. They're a bit thin, and there's not much of a crunchy texture. Otherwise, these are good chips and well worth trying out.",4

B001ELL364,"This is nice flour, maybe a little coursely ground but tastes very good in gluten free baked goods.  The bags were not short-dated or torn but they were very beat up (maybe by the shipping - they were packed loose in a HUGE box with a few air pillows so they rattled around in the box).  The product tastes as fresh as any I have purchased at my local stores.  The price is good.  This keeps very well when stored in the freezer in a ziploc bag.",4
B000FNB3AI,"I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it.",1

Most k-cups run from about $0.45 - $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that. Bring the price back down to something reasonable and your 5-star review will return.",4
B000FNB3AI,"While Nana's makes generally excellent cookies, this particular formula is quite strange.

B000ST9GCQ,"I am by no means a coffee expert, but you would have to have a string of mental conditions to prefer this ""coffee"" over mud in a cup.  The taste is terrible at best, no amount of sugar and cream added makes it more tolerable, and quite honestly, there is a reason why Via sells better.  IT TASTES BETTER.  For several reasons I might add.  You can get it in a variety of flavors, so finding one you truly enjoy isn't difficult at all (unlike Taster's Choice),<br />Starbuck's spent an incredible amount of time and effort perfecting the instant coffee while Nestle appears to have pulled theirs outta their lower back.<br /><br />Long story short....if you like coffee, don't even try to settle for this.<br /><br />If, however, you have no love for coffee, and are solely interested in a bit of caffeine, I guess this would suffice, but honestly there are less disgusting ways to get it (apples for example).",1
B004YV80O4,"I know Macaroni and Cheese is supposed to be cheesy, but somewhere along the line this product became a bit too rich. The liquid cheese mix alone isn't bad, but the seasoning or spices included in the package were too much. If you put them both in the macaroni, they don't mix well. In fact, I ended up eating the macaroni with orange ""spice"" powder on the pasta. The taste isn't horrible, but it's not as good as the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese I'm used to. Oh, by the way, this set does not include cheeseburger - it's just the Mac & Cheese.",3
B007POT6RM,"I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of ""value pack"" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the ""new"" improved package at Stop & Shop.<br /><br />The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.<br />How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release ""New Coke"" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)<br /><br />Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those ""We heard you, and we're making it right"" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me.",1
B001NJI7GQ,"I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,",2

B001EO5QZK,"My experience so far with black organic teas is that they tend to be lighter in flavor that their non-organic counterparts although I can think of no good reason for this. Stash's Organic Ceylon is no exception - it has a good, but subtle flavor.<br /><br />The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Assam for an easy drinking English-style tea.",4
B001EQ4P2I,"Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.",4

The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state.",2

The package comes with two ""morphing"" flavors that are supposed to be cherry to cherry lime and orange to orange strawberry. They have the same plastic-like base texture, but there are tiny crunchy ""flavor changing beads."" I only bit directly down on two, which was enough to really release the flavor. They did not have a fruit smell either, it was similar to play-doh. Out of the entire package, one changed from orange to orange-with-something-funky and one did change from bland cherry to something close to lime zest. I didn't think they were worth the calories (220) to eat one individual package. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing or eating this flavor again.",2

Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.",2

I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.

The box is about 2""x1""x1"" and the actual amount is about half an ounce! For the price charged plus shipping this is the most expensive spice in my spice rack. Or NOT in my spice rack any longer, not because I used it up in one go (although that would have been very easy) but because I literally can no longer find it among my spice jars and baskets and suspect it was accidentally thrown away. (Seriously, you would not even have heard it fall, it was sample size, that tiny and light.) To their credit, the sellers must have a bit of conscience because they threw another (equally tiny) box of all-purpose seasoning into the package. I have managed to try this and it is a pretty good product. It might have been an inducement for me to go back to them had the Vindaloo amount been more generous. Now, it is just a reminder of my disappointment--which was the only thing huge about this order.",1

B0009PCP7W,"Due to our cooking habits we use a lot of avocados in preparing our meals.  From Mexican food to salads and sandwiches and of course Guacamole Dip, they are an important part of our dietary intake.  The Guacamole dip is a favorite in our household and my wife has at least six different recipes she prepares it with.  We do though use and try out various prepared mixes such as this McCormick brand...which by the way, is one of our favorites. This adds variety and we do love variety! I can tell you right now that if I were grading this product on quality and eating enjoyment I would give it five stars in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am giving this particular one a one star review and if it were possible, I would give it less.  Did you read the price on this thing!  I must tell you that the first reviewer here saved me a bunch of coin and a major temper meltdown.  Thank you Dutch for pointing the price of this product out to me.  I was actually ready to hit the purchase button on this one after I had added it to my shopping cart.  Thank goodness I had second thoughts and went back and read the review.  This product, when we purchase it at or local store cost around one dollar.  This is a somewhat reasonable price.  Did you realize that these folks are selling ONE PACKAGE (ONE OZ) for a total of $6.00!  Either this seller is trying a big time rip off or there has been a major typographical error here.  In either case there is NO WAY I am going to plunk out that much money for this stuff...as good as it is!<br /><br />Anyway, the mix itself is quite good.  We use a lot of McCormick products and have yet to find one we are dissatisfied with.  But the price here is absolutely outrageous to the point of being offensive.<br /><br />End of review but as long as we are talking about saving money.....<br /><br />Did you folks know you can freeze avocados?  Yup, for dip and spreads freezing these things works perfectly.  I am not sure how things are in your part of the country, but here in our little part of the world the price of avocados goes through wild fluctuations.  I have quite often seen them selling for $1.50 apiece!  No there is no way that I am going to pay that much for one of these things.  On the other hand, we often, for one reason or another, find these things relatively dirt cheap.  I just purchased a whole bunch of the things for .32 cents apiece.<br /><br />When we find these on sale like this be buy a great number of them.  We take them home, let them ripen to our taste, wash and dry them and then stick them in freezer bags...usually three our four or our family.  When we want to whip up a batch of dip or spread, we simply take them out of the freeze, let them thaw and we are in business.  After they have been frozen the skins simply slip right off and you can mush them up quite easily.  This dose not work if you like sliced avocados for salads or sandwiches as they are too soft and mushy. On the other hand, it makes great dip and spread.  We cannot tell the difference in the flavor of the frozen ones over the fresh.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks",1
B004CLCEDE,"I thought that I should try a single pack from my local co op before buying multiples. So glad I only bought one pack. These smell horrible, like chemicals.

B001LGGH40,When I first took a sip it is a shock to the taste buds as this is 100% fruit juice with carbonation.  I liked it chilled and it did taste like a soda from the bubbles yet not as sweet (syrupy) as a soda since there is NO added sugar. It is a healthy alternative to sodas and my kids loved it too. This was a great flavor since we love strawberry and the kiwi flavor added a twist. Genius product!,4
B0013NUGDE,"We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.<br /><br />But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste.",4
B006Q7YFLQ,"These ""bites"" are almost Oreo cookie sized.  As they are, they aren't the best size or shape for cats, though these are marketed for both cats and dogs.

A few of them tried to give the crumbles a second chance.<br /><br />I think these would be better for dogs.  While the concept of natural and raw is awesome, the shape and texture isn't the best for cats.<br /><br />ETA - I gave these to a friend who has 2 puppies, and they LOVED it.  She has 8 cats as well, and though the cats were interested, they didn't care that much.  I had given this 3 stars for the cats, but if you have dogs, they are definitely 5 stars.

I have two dogs between 50-60 lbs., and these are barely worth pulling out of the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using all the piggy twists (because I'd bought them), we are now used to this size and actually prefer them to the big cigar-like ones because they don't make such a mess.

Other than that, I would recommend this to other dog owners whose dogs like to chew and play tug-of-war. Just make sure you don't mind little pieces of treats all over your floor - it's surprising how much treat actually dispenses, and my dog tends to overlook some of the dispensed treats when he is feeling playful.

B007I7Z3Z0,"Have been enjoying this tea with the warmer days here. Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.<br /><br />If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:<br /><br />1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.<br /><br />2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?<br /><br />I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.<br /><br />Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real.",3

B001EQ57PC,"I can't get over how expensive and elusive freeze dried chive is to find and have searched far and wide in the wholesale clubs looking for a larger container than the standard .16 oz offered in the grocery store for McCormick's freeze dried chive at $3.99 or higher.  Sour cream and chive is almost a staple in my husband's diet and he goes through it like water so I gave this a try.  I have to say that the McCormick's does have a stronger taste and the chive is younger and better preserved, but comparing prices, The Traders Choice gives you a full ounce to .16 for about the same price so the value can't be beat and you can afford to use a little more to get the desired taste.",4
B000G6RYNE,"After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.",5
B001QEF4XC,"It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!",5
B000CQBZO2,"This is great soup but not worth $2.77 a bowl.  I bought 2 cases because the price was so good, Walmart was the only place that I found it for less but Amazon delivers to my door.  I paid $18.00 per case of 12 on 12/10/11, today when I went to reorder the price had jumped to $33.21!  Almost double in a little over a month.  I won't be ordering at this price, it's back to driving to Walmart or finding another soup for my lunch.",2

B007M83302,"These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the ""all natural nothing fake of phony"" as advertized.  Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear ""all natural no fake flavors"" - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced -highly processed, sweetner from starch and a source of carbs.<br /><br />So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  I just wish they wouldn't try and pretend to be something they are not - they are  snack food - we expect some downside",4
B000FYVKRS,"When I ordered these I was really hoping for some seriously tasty pepperoni sticks after reading reviews claiming that these were ""packed with big flavor.""  Pepperoni they are not.  If you are expecting seriously spicy and rich pepperoni you will be let down as I was.  Does that make these treats bad?  No, I still found them to be good in their own right.  They're like Slim Jim's that actually taste like you're eating meat as opposed to extruded grease logs.  They're pretty good and I may buy them again but be warned that it's just not quite pepperoni.<br /><br />On a side note, I received a sample of their 3 day cold smoked ""Old Smokies"" and those things are God in meat form, I highly recommend those.",3

B000I1OLTC,This product may be exactly what is described but I don't like the taste. For me it has too much clove taste and is almost medicinal in its strength. After steeping three minutes I couldn't finish the cup. With a two minute steep I could tolerate it but I know I won't finish all the boxes. I wish I could have found it at my local store to try first before buying so much.<br />I like Chai flavored creamers so I should have just ordered plain white tea and added that. The positive ratings made it sound good but for me the spice flavor is overpowering (like euclayptus menthol).,1

To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.",2
B0062A87HA,I have really been scared to use all these cans I bought due to the dented damage to almost all of them.,1
B0038AXN30,"I bought the chocolate infusion. I mixed it with organic whole milk, not using the full 10 ounces, and thought it was pretty drink-able. Not amazingly chocolate-y, but enough that I could chug it without feeling too ""healthy"". Definitely not something I'd savor though.<br /><br />It did mix up pretty smooth, with little of the clumps that just won't die and had a good texture.<br /><br />All the reviews I read said that they felt energized and full for a long time after they drank it. I drank it at about 2pm and didn't feel particularly full afterwards and now at near 4pm I'm feeling positively hungry. Meal replacement? Perhaps not.<br /><br />Also, I'm still feeling really sleepy so that whole energizing thing? Nah.<br /><br />Noting, a lot of the reviews I read were done around 2009 and were done with free samples. I'm wondering how much of their glowing reviews was based off of psychosomatic happy feelings on getting a relatively good tasting drink to experiment with, how much of it was due to them being people who were already pretty healthy to begin with ( also known as the raw/vegan/scary type who CAN easily subsist off of meal replacement shakes) and how much of it was that Amazing Grass had a better product back then and has since declined in quality.<br /><br />Not to be cynical, but I've noticed that the first year or so of a company putting out a product, they tend to have amazing stuff, and then it usually goes downhill after that. And then there are the others that get bought out and just suck after that. Naked Juice, Burt's Bees, I'm looking straight at you.<br /><br />Meh. I guess I'll finish this container since I already paid for it, but I doubt I'll be back for more.",2

Sorry, I would skip them.  My local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2.98 to 3.49 each.  Although these are healthier than some other cookies, you still have to watch the fat, sugar and salt contents.  Whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging, these fit the bill.  Just the price on this site is ridiculous!  Ask your grocer to start carrying them.",4
B000CQE3HS,"This is NOT food. Not for humans at least. Maybe a quasi-meat-flavored alternative to Ex-Lax.

On a positive note, my dog really likes them, so I give this two stars.",2
B007POT6RM,"As the title states, the main fault with this oatmeal is the artificial maple flavor. It's slight, but leaves an odd taste in my mouth. I mean, oatmeal is healthy and good in itself; why add that extra artificial sugar if it detracts from the overall taste of the food? In this case brown sugar would have been enough. Or at least use real maple syrup.<br /><br />Texture and consistency is up to you, based on how much water you put in and how long you cook it. I put in different amounts of water and I thought the oatmeal tasted best with more water. My guess is that the water diluted the strong sugary taste so that it was more palatable to me. I still give this product 4 stars, because most flavored instant oatmeal have this issue of using artificial ingredients that affect the taste.<br /><br />Ultimately, after trying different kinds of flavored instant oatmeal from various companies, I think I enjoy plain oatmeal with dried or fresh berries the most. Healthy and good, what more can you ask?",4
B000YSS7EO,"My twins love oatmeal mixed with their food.  I couldn't find organic at our local supermarket so I tried this brand online and they didn't care for the taste (we managed to choke it down with smaller amounts mixed in), but I then found organic gerber which they love!  I can mix the gerber with a little juice and water and they love it.  I would not purchase this brand of oatmeal or cereal again.  The only thing good about it is that it is organic.",2

B005VOOM4A,"The Company:  ""ITAL stands for all things Pure, True and Vital.

They are committed to ""sourcing the finest  quality 100% Arabica beans"".  Their ""organic coffees are Fair Trade Certified and USDA approved"".  The company started the ""Kicks For Cause Foundation"" of which partial proceeds form coffee sales go towards youth soccer programs.<br /><br />The Coffee:  I like good coffee.  This tastes like instant coffee.  The packets are nicely designed and the coffee is fresh, but the taste is  bland. Even with two packs per cup, the taste was very mild.  I also did not get much of a caffeine kick.  But what do you expect when the cost is about 'sixty-six cents' a packet?  You get what you pay for.",2
B0041NYV8E,"I don't have a cold right now but since I often take ginger and honey for a sore throat, I thought this might be a nice alternative.<br /><br />It might be, in a pinch.<br /><br />The ginger is strong.  Strong in a good way if you have a sore throat but you may not be that accustomed to it.  When I make ginger tea I use perhaps 3-4 thin slices steeped in a cup of water for about 5-10 minutes with a tablespoon or two of honey.<br /><br />I used about Â¾ cup hot water for a pouch instead of the cup.  The ginger is nice and strong, lingering in the mouth and back of the throad.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's a bit sweeter than I would prefer (even when brewed to the recommended level) and there's really no lemon taste- just an aroma.<br /><br />There's also a somewhat bitter aftertaste that I'm not so fond of.  This taste is not chemical, more like an herbal bitter note.  I'm more of a coffee person so you tea drinkers out there might actually prefer it.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time deciding between three stars and four.  It's good, not great.  Probably 3 for flavor (It's OK) , four for convenience (I like it)",4

B000KV61FC,"My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!",3
B007MAY97Q,I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE AND I AM SENDING THEM BACK BECAUSE THEY ARE ABOUT 3 X 1 1/2 INCHES THEY LOOK BIG IN THE AD AND THE LIDS KEEP POPPING OFF.  THE ARE $9.49 EACH--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THESE PIECES OF JUNK.,1
B0031UBVX6,Sorry but these things taste horrible and look even worse.  The packages are quite small too.  I had most of my family (seven of us) sample this and none of the kids could stomach it save one and they weren't eager to eat it more than the one time.  It was a terrible waste of money.  I suppose a very small child (under 2 years) who isn't capable of complaining or doesn't know any better might eat it but I can't believe the other reviewers can get anyone to eat this stuff.<br /><br />Sorry but it isn't mine or my families bag of fruit and I can only give it a rating based on my experience with it.,1
B000MGSJ5A,"O.k., so it's not officially kosher--but this is how you make gelatin without cow's hooves, for those of you who get grossed out by Jell-O if you think about it too much.<br /><br />Now foods is a company that sells gluten-free stuff, and this is no exception:  if you have celiac this won't make you sick.<br /><br />Even better, this is powdered agar agar, not flaked agar agar.  That means this will last for months, if not years--although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes = 1/2 tsp of the powder.  The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1/4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice.<br /><br />However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell-o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell-o--for that, you need Jell-o or kosher gelatin.  (You can add more agar agar to add firmness; but then it starts to taste like what it is:  seaweed.)",5
B000FPH1NY,"Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red ""meat"" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.",2
B0028A8ZEI,"I wonder if I got a bad batch?  I go these with the ""Gold Box"" deal they have going.  Maybe they're not quite as fresh, been around in the warehouse too long or something?  Because these were not near as good as the other Virginia Peanuts I've had or ordered from Amazon in the past.  The ""Royal Oak"" in the blue can is what I got last time and they were much larger, not broken, crunchier, and just better tasting.  Seemed silly to return 2/3 of the order, and they are not really awful, completly fine actually, but my expectations were for a premium product. Fairly decent peanut, but these are suposed to be the best.  They were not.  Going to order the Royal Oak next time.",3
B001NJI7GQ,"My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00!",5

B000KNCZ2I,"The peppermint Glee gum is a great alternative to mainstream, artificially-flavored chewing gum. The taste is pleasant, with a great balance of peppermint and sweetness. While most other gums use plastic and foil packaging, Glee gum uses a simple and natural cardboard packaging.<br /><br />However, working with fewer artificial ingredients does have a few drawbacks. First, as other reviewers have commented, the flavor does fade quickly. Second, the gum tends to be a bit sticker, which may be an issue for those with sensitive teeth.<br /><br />Overall, Glee gum is a great product and is the only gum I chew. Highly recommended for those who are looking for an alternative to artificially sweetened gum.",4

I use this coconut milk all the time and was excited to see the price that Amazon was offering it at, but like one other reviewer reported all six of the cans came with dents...and not just tiny ones. The box they came in was in perfect condition so I can only come to a similar conclusion that Amazon is trying to offload the undesirable cans without disclosing their compromised condition. Pretty lame and shady if you ask me. My first thought was to return them, but apparently grocery items are not eligible for return.",1
B000FBM3PO,"I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless.

They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.",2

B004CYLW7A,"When they say ""Crunchy nut"" they're not kidding, at least not about the crunch.<br /><br />These O's are sort of a cross between Honey Nut Cherrios, Cheetos, and broken glass, and they are very crunchy. To me, they smelled a bit synthetic out of the box (though they do not contain artificial flavor), but the flavor nicely rounds out (very similar to honey nut Cherrios but sweeter and nuttier) once milk is added. They keep their crunch: By the end of a bowl, they are minimally softened.<br /><br />To say they are made from ""Corn and Oat"" is a bit misleading. The first ingredient is corn meal, but oat flour is a distant 8th, squeezed between salt and caramel color. That's like saying you ate a cucumber when you really had a slice of pickle on your hamburger.<br /><br />Nutwise, it's more taste than nut. They do have a nutty flavor, but there's a meager dusting of ground peanuts scattered through the box. Any cereal with sliced nuts or a granola gives you many more nuts. I think it's a nice nut flavor, but the tagline ""nuts in every bite"" is only technically accurate.<br /><br />I got tired of all the chewing by the end of the bowl, so only get these if you really want your cereal crunchy.",3

He did recover (without the test) and came home and is on a special gastrointestinal diet now. However, I have to say that I had a large bag of these in my cupboard when he became ill and used them regularly as the treat of choice to get him in his crate.

B002OFZIV0,"I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.",3

I think adding some parmesan cheese would help as well, I may give this product another go round and see how that works.  I can't say this is any better or worse than any other one-pan dinner, so I suppose if you're in the market for that sort of thing, this is as good as it gets.",3
B000CQBZOW,"I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the ""flavor burst"", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The ""flavor burst"" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.",2

The flavor is off and the after taste is god awful. I ate one corn chip and decided I did not care for them so I ate something else to get the flavor of poop out of my mouth, because that is what these chips taste like, and I can still taste these poo chips.  I will not be buying these chips again at all.  There blue corn chips are really great, but the so called red powder they put on these is just so off.",1
B004ZIER34,"I was never much of a coffee drinker in college, and it was only when I moved out on my own, in graduate school, that I started to enjoy a good cup of coffee.  When I got my first real full time job, I would easily drink a pot of coffee every day.  However, as someone with a lot of gastrointestinal issues, coffee is a huge dietary sin.  The caffeine and acid could do me, and spur stomach aches that would last for days.  When I was officially diagnosed with acid reflux, my doctor told me to cut all caffeine out of my diet, cold turkey, until things were under control.<br /><br />Now that I have learned how to control my gastro issues, I am once again worshipping at the shrine of the coffee bean.  Since I began working again, I make a small pot daily.  But I quickly find myself feeling icky from drinking coffee.  So when I learned about Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I was thrilled.  It caters to people who have acid issues but love coffee.  I was thrilled to get to try it.<br /><br />My first impression was WOAH, this coffee is strong.  I am not a huge fan of french roast coffee, I tend to like a milder blend.  Once I got over the initial taste, and adjusted my milk and Splenda accordingly, I started to really enjoy this coffee.  While it was fresh and hot, it was pretty delicious.<br /><br />The problem with this coffee is when I returned to the pot for a second cup.  This was probably within 20-30 minutes of brewing, and the heating unit was still on.  But the coffee did not taste fresh at all; it almost tasted as if I had reheated coffee from yesterday.  It actually tasted more acidic that my normal coffee does.  So, I had to throw the rest of the pot out.  Because of this, I just cannot tell if this coffee really does allow someone with acid issues to enjoy a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the french roast blend; another blend may have better results.  I would certainly try another flavor, because as I said, the initial cup was fantastic.  If this could be purchased as a resealable container, I may be more likely to purchase it, and make only a cup or two at a time, so as not to waste it.  I am not ready to give up on this product just yet.",3

They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.<br /><br />But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.<br /><br />Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste.

B001CGTN1S,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the Chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia powder, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. My suggestion is to get some Chia and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible.",5
B001AY9GSC,So I guess I'm the first to try this on this site. So I shall tell you my experience eating it! Only actual ramen i can compare it to is Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun. So the main difference is this ramen is MILD and not Spicy like the Nong Shim counterpart. The broth is pretty tasty and not overbearing. The noodles are like the smaller Sapporo Ramen and not the large korean noodles that nong shim uses. There is little pieces of kimchi but its really not much to get the full kimchi taste. Hope you enjoy this ramen to!,4

B001E530IE,"This coffee has a really strong roasted/burnt flavor to it. If you like typical non-gourmet morning coffee then you will like this; however, I have traveled down south, to countries like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, etc. and have tasted fresh roasted REAL coffee direct from the trees at the farm the very next day after a harvest. I prefer my coffee black, as-is, in other words I like to drink and taste my coffee rather than pour in a bunch of other crazy flavors.<br /><br />Real coffee roasted properly is fairly smooth anyway, with a strong taste of coffee bean and a hint of smoke, it is very pleasing. This coffee is more like bitter burnt charcoal, but here in the USA we tend to drink coffee to stay awake so this coffee does have it's purpose, the burnt bitter taste slapped my eyes wide-open from the very first sip so I stay lively at work with a spring in my step all day, but not to any extreme, for example, 4 cups in 10 minutes didn't give me the caffeine jitters. I'll have to look for something a little smoother to drink at home though or I'll never want to sleep at night.<br /><br />If you like green bean fresh roasted, gourmet, or exotic coffees stay away, this is not for you. If you like to fill your glass with milk and sugar, then give this a try, you'll have to pour in twice as much flavor filled fat and sugar to cover up the powerful taste of this stuff. If you sip coffee at work to stay awake this is a excellent choice because it is at least 2 times stronger than Folder's or Maxwell's dark roasts.",4

B000ZTG4UG,"I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem?

The package is very small only 1/2 an oz so its a good size for those of us who can only eat very small portions.  The taste is very much like the crunchy cheese that gets stuck to a pizza pan.

B00166D8TW,"In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of ""Metabolic"" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.",5

I received malt, no chocolate.  Told Amazon.  They were very nice and immediately shipped another order... of plain malt again.  Since, I've tried to get a response from them.  No real answer, my emails are ignored (very unlike Amazon).<br /><br />I mean, if  they're having some sort of problem finding the right Ovaltine, at least respond and don't leave a very good customer hanging.  Just makes sense to me.  I appreciate courtesy, don't you?<br /><br />Now, at first, I was willing to forgive and forget; but stonewalling ain't nice.  Nope, not a proper way to treat customers.  I really must again add that this is not like Amazon; but somebody has really dropped this ball.  I even have gone to the trouble of paining them pictures,twice, giving links to the different Ovaltines.  No appreciation for my efforts; just silence.<br /><br />I mean, is it possible they expect me to accept what I didn't order but paid for?  Do they think sending another wrong item makes it OK?  Well, you see,their ""expecting"" that is what I don't like.  Changed my own generosity.  Come on, who likes to be stonewalled?  It's arrogant.<br /><br />So, if Amazon will just send the chocolate Ovaltine, as shown here, I'll re-edit this and tell you what I really think of the chocolate version.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />Well, I still haven't tasted the chocolate; but I thank Amazon for refunding my money.

I used to live near a natural food store that carried an excellent selection of fresh  spices, unfortunately with the recession they closed down.  These beans rival those that I could purchase there.  They have a robust vanilla flavor that came through very nicely in the ice cream I made.

B002LANN56,"On the back of the package there's the question ""What makes a well rounded meal for adult dogs""?  Well, according to the Chef Michael recipe it's MEAL.  Though beef is listed as the first ingredient (and is about 28%) the rest of the meal is meal.  Soybean meal, corn gluten meal, poultry by-product meal, plus soy flour, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, ground yellow corn (corn flour), ground wheat (isn't this flour?), pearled barley and glycerin.  Additives include animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols and animal digest (duh!).  Other fun stuff like salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor (so it tastes like steak not meal) dried green beans and dried potatoes and a lot of chemicals.  If you're wondering why so many meal and other flours, it's so that they can say that Beef is the number one ingredient.<br /><br />The bag says all the stuff up above makes it ""Grilled sirloin steak flavor and potato & green bean garnishes"".  A ""garnish"" is an item or substance used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink, per Mr. Collegiate Webster.  In other words, it's there to make things look better, but better for who (or is it whom?).

Per the bag they (Nestles Purina PetFood Company) prepare it with care (no added artificial preservatives, just lots of natural chemicals) and you then serve it with love (love is not included, you have to supply your own).<br /><br />""Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures sustantiate that Chef Michael.... provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs.  (Just remember to change their oil every six months, rotate their paws and vacuum their coats periodically. 'I confess, I made that up.')  'The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is a non-profit organization which sets standards for the quality and safety of animal feed and pet food.  ... there are non-voting advisors on each AAFCO committee who are mainly from industry, such as the National Grain and Feed Association, Pet Food Institute, and American Feed Industry Association. Unlike the FDA, AAFCO has no regulatory authority.'<br /><br />OK, let's remember that it's dog food.  Years ago we never bought dog food, the dog ate what we ate, with a little oil added from packed sardines to add luster to the dog's coat.  Dogs are carnivores.  In the wild they are scavengers and eat anything that isn't tied down, or tied down to long.  All these meals and flours are added for one reason and one reason only, 'THEY ARE CHEAPER THAN MEAT'.  Like most pet food, it's made to look and smell better to owners, most dogs could care less what it costs (unless they're an economics major) so I buy the cheapest I can find.  Make your own decision.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz",3
B0045XE32E,"It's hard to review a dog treat past whether or not your dogs ate the one you gave them and then wanted more!  Mind did.  They were happy to have the treat and even happier when they got another one later.  Of course, my dogs are good eaters and one of them, which I rescued from the street when she was about 6 months old and was malnourished, is loathe to ever turn down some food.  (I guess they never forget what it was like to be hungry...)<br /><br />What more can you say?  They were a hit!",4

Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try, I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).<br /><br />I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.

B004ZIER34,"I was interested in trying this coffee.  Although I don't have a problem with the acidity in most coffees, when we make a pot of coffee, we often tend to let it sit for several hours while we drink it over time, so we need a coffee whose flavor is able to be consistent for the duration.<br /><br />I was a bit wary of trying a French Roast--my husband and I tend to prefer our coffee on the mild side, and thus we usually drink Breakfast Blend varieties.  Upon opening the package, however, this coffee did not smell overly strong, nor was the flavor overwhelming.  In fact, perhaps due to the low acid, I found it to be a relatively mild-tasting coffee with just a hint of ""roastiness"" to it.  The flavor did remain fairly consistent over time.  I would not re-purchase this coffee myself, as there are definitely other brands that I prefer, but if you find the acid in coffee to be problematic, this may be worth a try.",4

B004R8J8E0,"Honestly -- I do prefer my own recipe (which is to use an egg batter, breading and hot oil and butter in a pan).<br /><br />But we (spouse and self) just tried this product and we consumed a lot less fat and calories using Shake'N Bake. My husband's first words were: ""Oh, this is good!"" And then, the more he ate, the more he thought he ""tasted vegetables."" By the time he finished, he said, ""It was okay."" My first (and lasting) impression was that I tasted, along with the pork chop, a hint of thyme and paprika and not much else.<br /><br />Shake'N Bake adds 40 calories per chop, but my recipe would have added more than that (egg dip plus breadcrumbs). Plus if each chop would absorb 3 tablespoons of oil, another 360 calories (and 42g of fat) per chop would be added. We're always looking for ways to remove calories and fat from our meals. From that perspective, I really like this product! (Isn't there always a trade off between additives, calories, fat, carbs and how something tastes?)<br /><br />I also thought Shake'N Bake was a lot less messy and much more convenient than my recipe. (There was no runny egg-wash dish to rinse out, no sticky breadcrumb mess to clean up and no greasy frying pan or grease splatter.) After shaking the pork, I simply threw away the plastic bag. (I supplied my own ziplock bag.)<br /><br />I had enough coating for six boneless pork chops. After coating each chop, I shook it a little and placed it in an ungreased baking dish.

I love it so much, I cant go back to the regular unflavored coffee. The only thing that's too bad is that it's artificially flavored. I care not because of the taste, but because artificial flavors are probably not too good for me. But I love the taste anyway! Senseo could easily use natural vanilla flavoring, it is probably more expensive, but they should do it anyway to give their customers a better product. Unfortunately too many companies today use non-natural ingredients in the quest for larger profits, which is a sad commentary. Senseo, you need to start using natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial for the health of your customers.<br /><br />But I still love the taste and cant drink any other coffee! The Senseo coffee in general is so wonderful. I've gone through two machines already. The frothiness of Senseo coffee is so delightful...its like cappacino froth only better. I use Silk Vanilla creamer too which gives it an even better taste (their product DOES have the natural vanilla flavor so maybe that is helping with the taste.) Then I always top off my coffee with cinnamon sprinkles which makes it even more wonderful!<br /><br />All in all, a great coffee and coffee system, just please start using natural flavor Senseo, for the health of your customers!

B000084ETV,"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?",2
B003NDA970,I ordered 3 6lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews. I really like it but the real test was my wife's opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1/2 lbs of popcorn from the Boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. We use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. I really like the Cambria's Cream kernels the best,4
B0040WE8NE,"I wasn't expecting much from these noodles but they really didn't taste anything like any pad thai I have ever tried. There was too much seasoning and it didn't dissolve very well so the ""sauce"" was kind of chunky. I found that by using only about a third of the seasoning packet they were edible (though bland) but this is not something I would purchase again.",2
B001LXYA5Q,Make sure you salivate a lot and don't swallow for best results. They'll typically last a few hours. They're a big hit for guests. You can even get by with half after you've had one or two. Doesn't work too well on liquors but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect.,5
B001IUKD76,"I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.<br />It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back. Check it out.",5
B0041NYV8E,"I prepared this hot with 250ml of water like the package suggests but it was too strong tasting. I added more water but it was just too sweet and did not have a good flavor. It did dissolve well with no problems. I really enjoy ginger, but this product was not for me.",3

B0041NYV8E,"I tried this as a hot drink, and I have to say that I found it completely unpalatable (three sips into the drink I had to pour it out, as I could not take any more). I can conceive of only using this as a medicinal drink for upset stomach, nausea or vomiting. I don't dislike the flavor of ginger, in fact I like it as a mild seasoning when cooking, or as a light flavor in sweets, but this was totally overpowering, to the point where I could hardly notice the lemon and honey flavors.<br /><br />In my line of work I routinely recommend ginger for GI upset, this drink is so overpowering, though, that I would have to caution users to use it for extreme cases of nausea/vomiting only, unless they have a strong tolerance for the flavor. P-)",3
B000E7QYNG,I ordered these seeds to grow for my animals.  The packaged arrived in terrible shape with seeds spilling out everywhere.  I am not sure how much volume was lost on the trip (I did not weigh it).<br /><br />I did germinate the seeds as directed - which was very easy.  The germination rate was good and the grass was very nice.<br /><br />My cats (and my dog) love it and I also gave some to the neighbor who also loved it.<br /><br />The product itself is good - they just need to have better packaging.  A thin plastic bag in a mail envelope is not the way to go.,3
B001LGGH40,"This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas, but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But, the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others, like the cherry which I also got.",4

B0009JMW1C,"After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)",2
B0062A87HA,I had damaged cans as well.  Eight of the 12 cans were VERY dented. The box was perfectly packaged and undamamaged.,2
B001FQ0UEE,I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :(<br />So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.<br /><br />I carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good.<br />Also the tin is very cute.,5
B002LANN56,"Chef Michael might be a fictional character in the same vein as Aunt Jemima and the Keebler Elves, but that doesn't excuse him from putting some truly nasty ingredients into his Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. So many other reviewers have pointed out the list of dubious ingredients that it doesn't pay to duplicate them again, but I urge you to take a long, hard look at that list before you commit to purchasing this item.<br /><br />Nutrition aside, this is a very tasty food item based on my dogs' response to finding it in their bowl. Frankly, they went bonkers over Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet, but I will continue using it as a treat.",2
B008Z4VAPM,"I love this stuff-I think it tastes great! And I even grew up in Japan in a Japanese household with a Japanese mother who makes much better miso soup but since my mom doesn't live nearby, this is the perfect substitute for me.

B000UBDKII,"We got our Senseo coffee maker through a promotion. I had always wanted to try it out. I purchased a variety of coffee pods and my husband and I tried them out. We have yet to be disappointed. We love it so much, we have told several people about the Senseo and they have gotten them as well. This is a wonderful product and we waste a lot less coffee using the pods instead of making a pot of coffee. In fact, I think we drink a lot more coffee we want to try all the varieties of the Senseo coffee pods. Pair the pods with The Barista Blend flavor packs, sit back and enjoy.",5
B001ELL86Y,"This is very good coffee, but nearly every one of these k-cups ends up opening at the top around the rim while brewing and leaves coffee grounds in the machine and also in my coffee cups. My wife and I have been through several boxes of these and it has been the same with every order. We haven't had this problem with any other brand of k-cups. We won't be ordering any more of these until we see from the reviews that this is no longer a problem.",3
B001LGGH40,"This product is absolutely not to my taste.  It is advertised as a carbonated juice drink, so I kinda expected something along the lines of Welch's Sparkling Grape Juice; I was wrong. The first thing I noticed after opening the can was the aroma; it was unpleasant.  The drink is not very strongly carbonated and there isn't much bite to it.  The strawberry/kiwi flavor is very muted and is masked by something terrible.  The taste was bad going down but worse after a minute or so, as the aftertaste is strong and unpleasant.<br /><br />On top of the bad taste and unpleasant aroma, the drink has a considerable amount of calories for a small can at 135 calories per 8.3 ounces.  Perhaps there are vitamins and things in the drink that make it worthwhile for people who... well, I am not sure who might like this stuff.<br /><br />1/5 - not recommended<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I just don't like it.",1

When I opened the can and tasted them the had a very metallic taste and the inside of the can was discolored so I threw them away rather than take a chance of making myself sick. There is a date code on the top of the can of 0303 which I have no idea what that means and I can't find any explination of this code online. I will not buy this brand mushrooms anymore. I am a mushroom lover and I have bought many large cans of mushrooms in the past and I have never had them taste like these did.",1
B006Q820X0,"This coffee I would not purchase again.  It just did not tickle my taste buds.  It had a flavor and strength I did not find to my liking.  I am very fickled when it comes to my morning coffee, and this one just did not do it for me.",2

B008ADQQ3O,"Butterscotch is another one of those flavors that I adore. Butterscotch anything is pretty much a guarantee I buy it. I love the rich buttery-ness of it. In my drinking days, butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink. I love it. Mix it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa...oh yes. The best, though, is around the holidays, mix a touch of it into egg nog. Ooooh, now that's an idea, egg nog matcha. Red Leaf Tea, I will love you forever if you develop an egg nog matcha by the holidays! I can't have real nog any more, so I've been hunting for a good tea substitute.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. Butterscotch is love for me. It's another Dad memory, he loves it and it makes me think of him...or maybe I'm just homesick this week. Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping, I'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff. Liquid gold, it is. And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors, I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing. I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte, despite it being stupidly hot outside. Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee? These hot days are killing me...I should be able to handle them better!<br /><br />No, I went for a cold matcha instead, it's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks, though this one was made to be enjoyed hot. Hot with a touch of rum and milk. Mmm...anyway. Yes. Cold, it's less than stellar, but it's still yummy. Very buttery and rich, but not too rich. I want to sip on this all day, but I need to save some for when it's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink. It does taste like candy, but it's not overwhemingly sweet. It's just tasty.  I'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends, though. This one's good, but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I'm going to keep it on my shelf or not. Perhaps a warmer water temperature will help, or a better ratio of tea to water. Still, it won't be hard at all to convince myself to drink this one! I might even be convinced to share it.",4
B004DPDXMA,I thought the kids would love this pancake mix.  Especially my oldest son who loves red velvet cake.  He liked it well enough but not enough to ask for it again.  My youngest has no interest in having them again.  May be a good item but not for us!,3

B004HOLD92,"Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.",3
B002IEZJMA,"I buy illy coffee and espresso grounds on a fairly regular basis, as it is one of my favorite brands of coffee, so I was excited to try their issimo Coffee Drink, Caffe. The first thing to hit me was the sweetness, which was a little unexpected, since I don't normally drink coffee quite that sweet, but it wasn't too overpowering. The overall flavor was actually fairly robust, but missing that fresh-roasted bite, and had a somewhat unpleasant artificial/manufactured aftertaste (perhaps from being housed in a can?).<br /><br />I did, however, get a big energy perk from the coffee, which allowed me to focus and bolstered me through my morning work.<br /><br />Overall, I think I'll stick with fresh ground illy, as there is no beating fresh espresso in the morning. But, if I'm ever in a pinch and need a quick pick-me-up, I might consider grabbing a can as a quick substitute.",3
B002SOR6VM,My Dogs love this natural kibble.  It's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty.  They maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements.  Wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog's diet and keep it out of their food.,5
B004ZIER34,"Normally I wouldn't buy French Roast because it's too strong of a flavor for me. But because this was a low acid coffee, I wasn't as concerned. I don't suffer from heartburn, acid reflux or mild stomach irritation, but I enjoy decaf coffee the majority of the time. This coffee looked fine, but it didn't smell good. To me, the smell of the coffee brewing is almost as good as drinking it. There just wasn't much of an aroma while brewing or after pouring in the cup. I added cream and the taste was ok. The aftertaste stayed with me long after drinking the coffee. I'll stick with decaf.",3
B000FA38ZY,"By volume, these cookies are mostly biscuit and marshmallow, with a coating of chocolate. However, the predominant flavor is one of dark chocolate; the biscuit and marshmallow don't have much flavor. And that's okay, IMO. Some cookies with marshmallow as a major component can be rather over-sweet. These cookies, while certainly sweet, don't go over the top in that department, so kudos for that.<br /><br />This may sound like a niggling point, but these cookies are very messy to eat. Bite into one, and you're guaranteed to get a shower of crumbs and bits of chocolate down your front. There's just no way to avoid this, other than jamming a whole cookie into your mouth at once.",3
B002QWP89S,Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.,2

B005K4Q1VI,My box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa arrived today and I've just tried it. Delicious. Made a big cup [by mistake] but I'm happy with the flavor and consistency.  No off tastes that I can discern.  A little disappointed at high sodium content. Nice to have as fall starts to chill.,5
B001EO5QZK,"****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****",4
B001EQ5L0I,Tea is OK in flavor but not as<br />earthy as some. The Teavana<br />blend is much stronger with greater<br />fragrance and more molasses and<br />chocolate flavors. Pu-erh is<br />expensive and this tea is at the<br />high end.,3

The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.",3

She spent a long time working the treats out one by one, and I was really happy with how busy it kept her.<br /><br />Until I went to pick it up to bring it inside with us at night.  I found several little pieces of the rope part that she had torn off.

B0041NYV8E,"Decent-tasting beverage.<br /><br />Personally, I'd prefer more lemon for flavor.  Not bad, otherwise!<br /><br />I rate ""Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix"" three stars!",3
B0041NYV8E,"I am a real fan of ginger and honey. I drink a lot of Republic Of Tea's versions, plus I love those real ginger - ginger ales, the kind that almost burn your throat and you can feel it going all the way down!  Well, Kili's instant beverage is not quite what I'm used to and that is fine, but I did not care for it. As I say, I've had lots of ginger and ginger/honey drinks, but this had some kind of odd flavor to it.<br /><br />First impression, the drink was not a tea, not in a bag etc. When you open the single serving pouch, there are dark granuals inside that you just dump into a  cup. It says to add water but in MLs so I was lucky to fing out my Pyrex measuring cup had MLs on there. I added hot water and stirred it. The color in my cup was pretty dark brown, a lot darker than my teas etc. The scent was okay, not bad. But the flavor, at a very small sip, was super strong. I don't think watering it down would really help either. Also, the ginger aspect was pretty sweet and reminded me of candied ginger, (which I love) but that other flavor, I don't know what it was..was distracting.<br /><br />Personally I would not drink this again and did not try it cold. That might be better but the flavor really put me off. I did like the convenience that the sweetener was already in there, that it was granuals so no teabag to mess with.",2
B002DHTWNO,"I've tried a couple of other flavors of this brand and they were great, however, this pepper flavor was over the top. Way too much pepper for my taste. So much so that I couldn't eat more than a couple of pieces and I don't plan on eating any more of it.",3

B001LGGH40,"This is what happens when you try to cross a juice with a soda and it somehow works.  Carbonated, slightly sweet, and 100% juice, this drink gives you the bubbly soda experience without the sticky sweetness that makes you feel slightly ill.  The berry flavor is not too strong and the carbonation is just the right amount.<br /><br />The only downside is the size of the can.  For some reason this comes in Red Bull-sized cans, which leave you wanting more.  A regular 12 oz soda can would have served this excellent drink better.",4
B0009VFGKO,"I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.",1

B008ZRKZSM,"I think the concept of this item is great. I have only eaten mixed with water and it's just okay. I don't like that sugar has been added since I only use natural PB that needs to be stirred w/ no extra oils etc. I like PB but am not a 'nut' about it.

Try it alongside your current favorite; it should hold its own.",4
B002DHTWNO,"It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.

I'm not too sure that is a good thing as, for example, he usually is a self-regulated eater and eats when he is hungry vs. sitting down to what I would compare in human terms of a bowl of buttery popcorn.  I am now only giving him a small portion of this food as a ""treat"" every now and then and have put him back on his normal, healthier dog food.",3

The taste is really bland, too.",2
B000YJ1JRK,Kellogs Rice Krispies Treats--Crispy Marshmallow Squares.  Cheaper at Costco when they have them in stock.  Stock varies as Costco doesn't always have a product when you want it.

B001E5E20O,"contrary to all of the glowing reviews this is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had - and that is comparing against bagged tea from the grocery store in addition to other loose leaf brands.<br /><br />The smell is way too perfume like yet still a bit pleasant, but the taste is nothing like the smell.  Way too astringent for me - yuck.  I've tried various weights and water temps to no avail.  The first steeping is not good, the second is more drinkable for me, 3rd steeping is not worth the effort.<br /><br />I've choked down the first can and a half.  I'm going to gift the 3rd unopened can to someone who might enjoy it more than myself.<br /><br />This tea is so bad I wonder if Rishi is all marketing, packaging, and setting price points to brand a sub-par product and then have a team post positive reviews all over the net.  I'm not saying its so, but it does make one wonder . . .<br /><br />2 stars only because I didn't horque it up.",2

B003R0LKT0,"My cat just won't eat it.  She tried a few bits and sat up for a few moments after each bite and acted like she was trying to figure out what was odd about the taste.  I've never seen her do that.  She wouldn't eat it.  I tried mixing it with some Fancy Feast, but she sniffed it and just sat there and wouldn't eat it. This catfood is very much like very wet babyfood.  It doesn't have anything to ""bite"" into. It's very mushy and soft.  I suspect that it has too many vegetables and not enough meat and fish in it.  I feel bummed that I have wasted my money on this.",1
B001EQ55RW,"I had such a curiosity about these Cocoa Roast Almonds that when they showed up, I took them into the office and asked coworkers to sample them and tell me what their impressions were. One coworker -- I'm call her H -- described the snack as tasting like ""almond-flavored Cocoa Puffs."" Another coworker -- let's call him J -- said they took him back to his childhood by reminding him of Ovaltine without the milk. Most of my taste-testers concurred with H's description when they heard it.<br /><br />I have been finding these nuts to be a good afternoon snack. They're vaguely chocolately, but not in an overly rich way and not so much so as to make me feel like I'm indulging.<br /><br />If you avoid artificial sweeteners, take note: Sucralose is an ingredient.  Otherwise the ingredients are pretty natural: Dutch-processed cocoa, almonds, salt.<br /><br />So in short: if you like the flavor of Cocoa Puffs, and you think almond flavoring would improve them, and you like quasi-healthy snacking, and you don't mind artificial sweetener, these will probably be a favorite for you. Otherwise, plain roasted almonds may be a better alternative.",4
B003ANFMY8,"My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.",1
B001EPNCR8,"You might as well save your money on this product. I had been looking forward to receiving this so much, but wound up so disappointed. First of all, the product looks nothing like the picture shown on the packaging. It is not a croissant as we know it; it looks more like an ordinary roll and VERY small at that! What made it worse, is that as I was eating it, I kept wondering WHERE the creamy custard filling was. It wasn't until I reached almost the end, that I got it! Yes, the filling is delicious, but if they put in more than HALF a tsp. of it, I'd be surprised.<br />Another point to consider...why do they charge over $8.00 to ship this product, when it's as light as a feather? Please consider the product itself only costs $4.49!!!! I've never written a review before, but am feeling so outraged by this, that I felt I had to warn others.",2

When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.

B003VIWN94,"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.",2

Mozzarella cheese doesn't have much flavor, so it is logical that the Cheez-ITS don't have much flavor. So, why did my husband and I eat the whole box?

B000F9Z1WI,"We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the ""Oreo Biscuit"").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the ""modern"" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for ""hill""), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the ""cream"" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: ""Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees"").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.",4

The seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price. I would recommend you stay away from these.  You can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store.",1

B00247D568,"I discovered Nutrisoda a couple years ago on a cruise to Hawaii.  I was delighted to find it available here on Amazon when I got home.  I ordered several cases of the assorted ""rainbow"" flavors and was a happy camper UNTIL Nutrisoda changed everything  -  the cans and the flavors!  The ""new"" flavors, even if they call them by the same names as the originals, are NOT the same.  There are fewer flavors - only four as opposed to the original seven, and these newer sodas, even with the same names, do not taste anywhere as good as the originals.  My favorite was this one  -  the Energize  -  but it's just not the same drink that was in the pretty orange can.  Not sure why Nutrisoda decided to make the changes, but I'm not buying any more.",2

B000LKVDUU,"This definitely does not taste like the vegetable/navrattan korma I've had from restaurants. This is kind of oily and the vegetable korma I order out is always creamy. This also has cubes of cheese, which I've never had in my vegetable korma before. However, I think it has a good flavor. If I could describe it in non-Indian terms, it's a bit like a minestrone flavor, but of course it has that curry gravy. I would agree with the other reviews, I noticed maybe three pieces of cashew in this. I thought vegetable korma has raisins in it too, but this doesn't seem to have any. This is actually one of Kitchens of India's lower-calorie offerings -- I wondered how vegetable korma could be low calorie, but now I see it's because it's not creamy the way it is at restaurants. Still, it's decent if you don't expect the same thing you'd order out. Would go well with some basmati rice.",4

It doesn't taste bad, it just isn't anything super special, I ""have to have"" kind of sauce.<br />I enjoy it; the sauce is creamy - not as creamy as the Jalepe&ntilde;o, whose flavour I enjoy more - and it is flavourful. I use it on sandwiches, wraps, and pita pockets.<br />I have nothing bad to say, but I don't want to seem like I'm trying to spice up my review or give a false impression that I'd go out and buy this as often as I can.<br />I may or may not buy it again, but then again, I'm not the biggest chipotle fan; I just wanted to try it and see how it tasted. Not bad, but again: I prefer the jalepe&ntilde;o,<br />probably 'cause I love the taste of jalepe&ntilde;o a lot.

I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.

I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.

I keep 'sticks' of lemonade flavored Crystal Light in my purse.

(2)Unlike those difficult-to-open 4-ounce cans of crabmeat sold by MW Polar brand, these 6-ounce cans sold by Consul brand can be opened conveniently using a can opener.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)The quantity of crabmeat is very bad.  After squeezing the opened can to drain the water away, the level of the crabmeat drops to below the halfway point in the altitude of the can.

B005J0Q906,"The anchor of the Jim Beam small batch collection (the lowest price, shortest bottle, longest posted age in the barrel and the biggest sales of any small batch bourbon) Knob Creek is a big substantial bourbon that oozes class and quality. It begs to be sipped neat and slow. It stands up to the best bourbons without embarrassing itself.<br /><br />In the glass it's a rich spessarite garnet reddish orange with a tinge of henna. The redness is coming from the #4 char oak barrels. That's the darkest level of char. This char level shows up all over Knob creek - from the color to the nose to the last notes of the finish. Knob Creek's extensive time in the wood is a big part of its character and the fact that the wood was darkly charred is a big part of the wood's character.<br /><br />The nose brings up toffee, leather, and bitter orange. Further nosing brings out vanilla, cream, and some earth mustiness - like forest floor leaves and loam. It's a complex, appetizing, and pretty sophisticated nose for a bourbon that some folks don't respect enough, in my opinion, because it's so universally available.<br /><br />The initial taste on first sip is sweet with brown sugar and moassess. That's followed up by a big midpalate expansion spicy on the edges of the tongue with 100 proof and full of a sophisticated sherry quality. The finish is redolent with oak wood and a bitter orange note in the back of the tongue. There's char in the finish, vanilla, sandalwood perfume and a distant and pervasive backdrop of charcoal and creosote. You don't notice it at first but it builds up as you devour your glass. There's also a sour tang that shows up slowly over time that I have come to associate with Jim Beam. It's very subtle but it's the thread that binds the disparate Jim Beam stable together.<br /><br />This is a big, rough, very masculine bourbon. It's a frontier cabin with leather, musket, and wood fire raging. It's also elegant and refined - to a point. I have no trouble recommending it - but have to point out that Elija Craig 12 has a lot of the same flavor profile (but more sweet and less char) for substantially less money. In any case, you'll have no trouble finding Knob Creek and once you start sipping I sincerely doubt anyone would regret any part of it even for a minute.",4

B004MO6NI8,"Granted, No Fear is better tasting than most of these types of energy drinks.  It's fruity like a popular canned punch and there is enough in this can to split between two adults.<br /><br />However, regular coffeehouse drinkers may be a little disappointed if they don't feel the same rush they get from an espresso shot, though this also contains a significant level of caffeine.  Also, to try to put it mildly: If coffee tends to ""run through you,"" don't be surprised if this has a similar effect.<br /><br />Despite the impressive list of supplements, this is not a health drink, by any means. It cannot overcome the fact that High Fructose Corn Syrup (after carbonated water) is second on its list of ingredients- it's a GMO food additive that dehydrates the body, for starters.<br /><br />At 66 grams of sugar in one can, it's like drinking fruit flavored soda with vitamins added. This may seem effective short-term if you're mostly interested in a tasty energy boost and you prefer this type of method to obtain your sugar intake.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the nutritional supplements cannot counteract the other ingredients, especially if you need increased energy long-term.",3

Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour.",2

This tea Goes well with classic tea accompaniments such as cookies, cakes, cucumber and ham finger sandwiches etc. and would also be good to accompany a meal.  Not really the tea you would choose to serve with sushi except for that style of California Roll  that is made with chopped crab (or Kreb surimi) and Mayonnaise, Which was really enhanced when served with this tea.",4
B000G6RYNE,"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close.",5
B004MO6NI8,"I am not too familiar with energy drinks, so my experience is somewhat limited. I was feeling pretty draggy at around 6pm, and it was a Friday night, so I felt like I needed a boost. The can said it had 2 servings, but I went ahead and downed the whole thing. Within a minute or so, my head was tingling and my eyes were like saucers. Is this normal?? I don't know if it was a placebo effect or if this stuff actually had an effect on me. It might have also had something to do with the video game I was playing, but I can't say for sure. Caffeine usually doesn't have a big effect on me... aside from causing an occasional acne flare up. (The side of the can DOES say it's not recommended for people who are sensitive to caffeine, so I'm assuming there's some caffeine in there).<br /><br />As for the taste, it wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either. It tasted like Sprite mixed with Pomegranate juice. It wasn't the best beverage I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.<br /><br />I'm happy to report I didn't have any sort of crash afterward. I don't know if it really had an effect on me, or if it was all in my head. Nevertheless, this drink certainly wouldn't be bad to try.",3
B000G6MBX2,"I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.",1
B001QY27AU,"""Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai"" seems more like an attempt to cash in on a health fad instead of creating a balanced and delicious tea.  Here you have three products that have recently been hailed as miracle foods all bundled into one cuppa together.<br /><br />Although the health benefits and drawbacks of both green tea and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932657746"">pomegranate juice</a> have been well-documented, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZWTDS"">Acai berry's</a> claims are more tenuous.  Acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries, and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims.  Even so, with this tea listing ""pomegranate and acai flavors"" as the final ingredient on the package, the amount of each fruit is so minimal as to be inconsequential.  There is far more ""organic hibiscus"" and ""organic rose hips"" in this tea than either pomegranate or acai ""flavors.""<br /><br />But the real bottom line on any tea is the ""Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai"" just doesn't taste very nice.  It tastes like none of the listed ingredients, and comes off as more of an attempt at making <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DG0"">Kool-Aid</a>-flavored  tea than anything else.",1

B000UZVPKO,"Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).<br /><br />I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.

B004S07FZ6,"I purchased these very large cans of chili because they were priced ridiculously cheaply at the time. I planned to split the cans up into smaller portions and freeze the smaller portions to make a large number of meals. The first can I opened looked a little different from other Hormel chili I have had in the past. The beans were all mashed up and there were large chunks of cubed meat in the chili. Normally the meat resembles little pieces of ground meat. These were weird unappetizing chunks. The chili had no chili taste. It tasted like slightly burned re-fried beans. The night after eating this and the next day, there were numerous trips to the bathroom. Won't give details - but it wasn't pleasant.<br />A few days later, I opened a second can hoping the first was just a one time thing. The second had the same mashed up beans and meat chunks. I tossed it and now have four large cans of chili that I will never use.<br />Maybe this was just a bad batch. It almost seems as if they scraped the old chili residue off of their pots, threw in some leftover meat chunks, canned it and sent it to me. Needless to say, I will never purchase this product again.",1

I don't buy into the ""net carbs"" mentality - a carb is a carb, and I was disappointed that they'd put something so hokey on their packaging without anything to back it up.  Some poking around on their website will tell you they have a method of producing the starch so that it gets through undigested, and decided I was going to drink the kool-aid and give it a try.<br /><br />The pasta tastes - like pasta!  It has none of the strange taste or texture you'd find with a whole grain variety.  You wouldn't be able to detect any difference if you tasted it next to any other brand.  Do I really think I'm only getting 5g of carbs per serving?  No.  But it tastes normal and it can't be any worse than regulary pasta so I'm going to keep buying it just in case they're right.

B001LG945O,"This 100% juice, carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda. As a somewhat health-conscious consumer, I avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as much as possible. This beverage contains no HFCS, no added sugar, no preservatives, and no added color. I'm sampling the orange flavor. It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.<br /><br />This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products. If I want orange juice or crave soda, I'll rather drink the real thing.",2

B007R1PGVS,"There was this one energy drink I had been buying from Wal-mart.  It was the only place I could find it.  Then one day, it was pulled from the shelf in every single Wal-mart within an hours drive.  And that's a lot of Wal-marts!  This energry drink was quite possibly the best I had ever and will ever taste.  I could get a 10-pack for $1.50.  That price just couldn't be beat and it tasted great too.  The only place you can get it now is from a somewhat shady looking website that sells 10-packs for like $15.  So there I was energy drink-less.  I started looking online for alternatives and I came across Zipfizz.  I figured I'd check some local stores for small packs to sample and give it a try.<br /><br />I purchased this product as somewhat of a ""blind buy.""  I had tried the orange, citrus, and pink lemonade by purchasing small three packs at some of the local stores.  However, I wanted to try the grape and the berry.  The only way I was going to be able to do that was to buy them online.  So I went for the berry.  About the best I can say is it's not horrible.  Just like the others I had tried, it had a very strong B-vitamin taste to it.  It was very overpowering in this flavor.  Having tried those other flavors, I would have to say this is probably my least favorite.  As for the rest, the orange is definitely top notch.  There's hardly any B-vitamin taste to it as it is masked by the orange flavor.  The orange sort of reminds me more of orange popsicles or an orange flavored drink than it does of an actual orange.  But it's still pretty good.  The same can be said for citrus, it covers the B-vitamin flavor well.  It has a similar taste to the orange, but it tasted like there was some lemon and lime mixed in there.  It was pretty good.  The pink lemonade is pretty good, if you can get past the fact that it's a fizzy drink.  And that's exactly what it tasted like, a fizzy pink lemonade.  It just had a minor B-vitamin after taste to it.  I haven't yet tried the grape, but would still like to.  After my experience with the berry though, I'm not hopeful.  Orange is good enough for me for now and I've actually found it cheaper locally in the big 20-pack.",3

B001BIXK7K,"Like most other 'sauces' in this heat range, this sauce adds heat to a dish without significantly affecting the flavor.  When you want to control the flavor of a dish with its other ingredients and just add pure heat, this is ideal.  The bottle has a dropper attached to the lid, so it is easy to meter out just the right amount.  Although the price seems a bit high for such a small bottle, it really is a good deal since it only takes a small amount to add a lot of heat.",5

In my opinion, when I did the job my old way the result was powerful (too strong).  After two more failed attempts I finally decided to read and follow the brief directions on the package. What have been enjoying for a few years is a strong tea with milk.  Now I have discovered a tea that can be enjoyed straight.",4

I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon!",4

B001LG945O,"I have tasted several of the other flavors of this drink, Switch, but I have to say that this one tops them all.  Perhaps it is because I like orange soda, and this drink seems to have all the elements of what I like in the soda without all the harmful ones. There is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors and it is gluten free.  This is especially great for someone with allergies, or those who are on restricted diets.  Add to that that it is 100% juice and tastes great and you have a winner.  I liked this product and plan to seek it out at my local store.",5

B0019QG5CG,When they say good condition they mean it. My bonsai came in great condition. It was on top of newspaper with styrofoam  filled to the top. It was even tightly wrapped with bubble wrap. Keep in mind that they really mean it when they say each tree is different. The tree i got was smaller than i expected it to be. But i dont know much about bonsais. And it came in a cream pot with moss. Which i love. SO when ordering a bonsai try not to get your hopes up because like i said each is different. THe one in the picture is just for to show you the type. For a four year old the price is pretty resonible. Most go in the thousands.,4

B000H227BG,"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.",2

But after a few of these treats, one of my German Shepherds started choking on it, and I had to pull it out of the back of her throat.  She wanted it back because she loves them so much, but it made me too nervous. I took them away from the other two immediately, even they were having no problem.  I wish they would come up with a chew that was safer.  I never give my dogs a chew unless I am right with them, but being there doesn't mean I would always be able to dislodge the piece that could potentially kill them.  Not worth it!",2

Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.  The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package.

They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.",3

No Joke pain.  Instantly. The first thing in my mind was why did I do that $%^&*(.  This product is something that you can add to a soup or something but don't put anymore than a drop in your mouth at a time.  It is a neat experience to put a drop in your mouth, serious pain for about 30 minutes but any more rips your insides.  This even from a person that heats habaneros by themselves with his food.<br /><br />If you are going to play a joke on someone, just a drop is good.

His quoto is below when I told him what some other people's reactions were when they took a drop.<br /><br />""Tell them my insides are STILL on fuego.

B004X3VRLG,"After our experience with other Funbites treats, I thought our dog Snowball would really enjoy these treats, but despite giving him these on different days, under different conditions, when he was hungry and when he was full, Snowball just wouldn't do more than sniff at them.<br /><br />Why?  I suspect that it must be the Peanut butter flavoring.  He's always eaten meat or vegetable flavored food and treats, and the peanut butter must be throwing him.  I may give the treats to a neighbor to see if their dog will eat them, but since these reviews are all about our experiences, I have to give this One Star - Snowball, a dog that I would think would eat ANYTHING, just won't give these a chance.<br /><br />That said, I'll have to buy another Funbites flavor for him to see if he'll like these.  He just loves the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X3VQ5I"">FunBites FlatSticks Calcibone, 60-Count (Pack of 5)</a>, so it isn't the outer ""crunchy shell"" - it's got to be the nutty flavor and scent.",2

I bought them as a lightning deal special thinking these would be a little healthier and keep me away from the Kettle chips that I love...after eating a bag of these, I want the Kettle chips back.  They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.  They remind me of Pringle chips just smaller and maybe a little puffier.",3
B001UFU13A,"As someone who enjoys eating fish and sardines, I was very disappointed in these sardines.  I have tried most brands of sardines and eat about 5-6 cans of sardines a week.  These sardines were extremely salty and the fish had a slightly off taste to them.  The sardines were almost as salty as anchovies.  I looked at the sodium content and noticed that it was same as some other tins of sardines that I had on the shelf but for some reason these were much more saltier than the other cans.<br /><br />I tried two tins thinking that it could have been a tin of sardines that were over salted.  The can was also difficult to open but I've noticed this problem with other sardines from Portugal.  A difficult can does not bother me as long as the sardines are worth the effort to get the can open.<br /><br />I had read a review online about these sardines and wanted to try them.  I usually do not write reviews but wanted to warn others.  I would suggest buying one can and trying it before buying anymore.<br /><br />One of my favorite sardines for the price is the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil [...]  The Matiz sardines are nice and plump and have an excellent flavor with great texture.  The quality to price is excellent for these sardines.<br /><br />Da Morgada sardines are my favorite as this current time, but Amazon does not carry these and they are expensive at other online retailers.  I would suggest trying a can of Da Morgada, if you have a chance to pick up a can.",2

The bad part, these are not super nutritious and these contain grains, which can cause problems for dogs. Now, if this is for digestion, I wonder why all three dogs had the worst gas ever.

B0009XPD64,"I've been feeding this to my 7 year old collie for the last 6-7 months.  She has allergies and a vet recommended that I put her on a limited ingredient diet to help ease the symptoms.  She was originally prescribed a prescription Science Diet food made with fish.  For reasons I don't remember, I stopped that and eventually ended up with this food.  At first, my dog LOVED it. But I've noticed that with the last two bags, she seems to have lost interest. On the second to last bag, I end up throwing out several cups of kibble because she'd let it sit there for an entire day (and she's fed twice a day).  Though I store the food in a tupperware container, it seemed like my dog was snubbing it because it wasn't fresh.  With the next bag, she excitedly ate the first few bowls... and now we're back to the same thing. She'll let it sit there for hours. I sometimes have to put treats in it just to get her to eat it. Maybe this food doesn't keep well?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this kibble has a noticeable fish smell which is detectable on her breath.  Also, I've noticed in the last month or so that my dog has had TERRIBLE smelling gas. Maybe that's just middle age catching up with her, but it's got to be at least somewhat related to what she's eating!<br /><br />So overall, I give this three stars.  My dog is one of the most food-motivated creatures you've ever met. Having food she won't eat is just frustrating!",3
B001E5E0I8,"These are addictive. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I once found a brand that came in whole sections instead of the small pieces.

The other problem with these ones from Amazon is that I ate them in like a week. There isn't a lot with the way I go thru them. But I like the fact that the only ingredient is mango.

B004JRKEH4,I like Taco Bell so I was anxious to try this sauce.  It's ok but also typical of a lot of sauces.  The flavor is good and the consistency is creamy but it's not as hot as I'd expected.  Taco Bell isn't associated with healthy food so not surprisingly there are 11g of fat in each serving.  The calorie count isn't too high (110) but the calories from fat are 100.  If you're looking for very hot or less fat (or both) there are a lot of better alternatives on the market.,3

B002TMV34E,"My life could be a coffee commercial.  I have to be at work by 5AM every day.  I can't say this Melitta Classic coffee makes me want to get out of bed per usual, but it has definitely been a perk over the last couple of days.  I drink a lot of coffee every day--usually a black classic roast of some sort.  And I have no shame in admitting that when I brew at home it is usually a mid priced coffee purchased at the Supermarket.  Its only when I am out that I get to partake in a more premium brand.<br /><br />I was delighted to find that Melitta's Classique is a medium brew ground super fine producing a rich and savory cup of coffee.  The balance of flavor is delicious and lends well to creamers. The only disappointment I encountered was the packaging.

B000FBM4FI,"I was looking forward to this order from Amazon. I've been on a calorie restricted diet for months and it's the taste of grains (bread, chips, crackers)that I miss the most. I find these Thin Crispbreads from Kavli to be the perfect solution. They are ultra thin. I mean they are thinner than you might think possible.<br /><br />As soon as I saw the first one I was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece. So far I have not come across a single broken cracker. My next thought was....""well, as soon as I bite into it, the thing's going to explode into a thousand tiny shards. I was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been. These crackers really hold together nicely.<br /><br />The flavor is very plain. There is no seasoning, and very little salt. they taste like the grains they are made from. I have ordered a case of the ""Garlic"" flavor and look forward to trying them. I eat these with a generous spoonful of very low calorie pepper and eggplant spread that makes for a very low calorie snack. I highly recommend these.",5
B004JRKEH4,"Taco Bell has built their reputation as a Mexican fast food restraunt, that is as successful in the Mid West as it in California.  This means that they make a product that is no thrills and bland enough that everyone will like it.  If you want authentic Mexican food Taco Bell is not for you.  Most Mexican food is very spicy and often has a little kick, I have seen Mexicans that use Tapatio hot sauce on hamburgers, rice and soups and Tapatio packs a kick.  The Chipotle sauce is nice and bland which is how most people like their food but it really does not pack the kick that a typical authentic Chipotle sauce has.  I tried it on tacos which was not good at all and nachos which actually was pretty good.  If Taco Bell is your choice for burritos and tacos than you will like the Chipotle Sauce.",3

After calling Amazon, I learned I could still get a refund, but that they would not accept the product back since it contains some food items.

Can't possibly be healthy and has made me a little gun shy of ordering this particular version of dog food.,2
B004PXEZAE,Good idea but sadly the product does not deliver. The bag is hard to open without burning your fingers or making a mess and most times the popcorn in the middle of the bag is burnt.

B002TMV34E,"I brewed this coffee with the recommended ratio of water to coffee:  6 oz. water & 2 teaspoons coffee.  It was very weak brewed this way; like coffee-flavored tea.  So I brewed another batch at 3 t coffee to 6 oz. water and it was better.  This is not a bad cup of coffee just not very complex & definitely a medium roast at best.  I brewed some 8 O'Clock Original roast for comparison (I thought that would be a good coffee to compare) & this coffee came in second to that.  This is not a very interesting cup of coffee; serviceable and good for people who don't like a strong brew.  I am not a black, tar coffee lover but I prefer more flavor.<br /><br />If you like a dark roast coffee like Starbucks, you will be underwhelmed.  But if you like Folgers or other grocery store brands, this is definitely a step above.

B006VJ9KX2,"I was excited when I saw this hot sauce so I ordered it right away. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to its name sake. I wouldn't even call it hot. Reminds me more of a cocktail sauce. Blair's Ultra Death sauce is what I would call hot... but it also taste like sh*t lol. The Scorpion Sauce DOES taste good but doesn't have the heat you would expect or want. It WILL mess up your stomach though.<br /><br />There was another reviewer that stated hes had hotter sauces that didn't bother his stomach as much as this did and he is absolutely correct. You could easily fill up a large spoonful of this stuff, let it set in your mouth a while, then drink it with no burning or sense of heat.... but your stomach WILL quickly disagree. Actually, just small doses of this stuff really irritated my stomach. I can drink a dipping bowl full of habanero sauce with minimal stomach irritation.. but just a small amount of Trinidad Scorpion bothers my stomach quite a bit. I just wish I felt like I accomplished something when my stomach hurts this bad. It's literally like downing cocktail sauce then feeling like you were bashed in the stomach with a base ball bat repeatedly. I do like the taste but the messed up stomach isn't worth it when there's no heat to justify the irritation.",2
B003VXFK44,"I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI"">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out.",4

B004X3VRLG,"First off I'm going to say I don't know what they mean by Congo, especially since its mini in this case.  I'm assuming that's just the general shape of the treat.  Regardless, my dog had a good time with it.<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was surprised to see these mini-congo's were not so mini at all.  This is a fairly large treat and I wouldn't recommend using it for training purposes.  This is one of those treats you should give instead of a bone or maybe once a week.  Which is what I've been doing.  My dog's a great bone chewer, actually its probably her only talent aside from making trouble and she can inhale one in no time flat.  When I saw this, I thought for sure that it would be gone in a good 30 seconds but surprisingly it took her longer.  The outer part of the treat is rather hard like a bone so she had to chew her way through it.  I'd say it probably took her a half hour to finish the entire treat and she does get excited when she sees the package now so I'm assuming she likes the taste (peanut butter) as well.<br /><br />The next thing to comment on would be that this is all about digestive support.  I don't want to get into too much detail but it seemed like instead of helping my dog's digestive system, it made it a little harder for her to do her business.  Each time after she's had one she's had a little trouble with her normal activities the next day.  Perhaps since she is already on a high protein diet, this is the cause of that since this is a high protein treat.  I'm not too thrilled with the ingredients in this treat either.  The ingredients include: Beefhide, Riceflour, maltodextrins, dextrose, caramel color, papain, and artificial peanut butter flavor.  Really, artificial?  Peanut butter's not that expensive and it would have been much better to give real than fake.  At least the beefhide and riceflour were real I suppose.<br /><br />As a whole I'd rate this an average dog treat.  You can't use it for training purposes due to its size and the nature of the treat means its not good on a daily basis.  Add in the artifical peanut butter and it does round to somewhere in the middle.  But hey, at least my dog liked it and it kept her busy long enough for me to cook supper.  So that's something.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011",3

I would like to try some with more nuts as shown though, they might be even better and the additional nuts might better balance the sweetness.<br /><br />The cereal stays crunchy in milk and is very satisfying to eat.

B001BZ7MCW,"These bars do contain fiber, and do have a fairly good taste. They are sticky on the fingers and are definitely chewy, a desirable quality in a chewy bar.<br />This is a deceptive product however. Almond pieces are far down in the list of ingredients and not easily found in the bar itself. Like strawberries? Look elsewhere for your strawberry fix because there are no strawberries in this bar, not even a sliver or seed. Instead one gets strawberry flavored bits of cranberry.<br />Call me crazy, but the lack of strawberries in something called oats and strawberry rubs me the wrong way.",3

Well, we've been buying Yuban Original Roast Ground Coffee from Amazon for about a year now, and folks, what can we say, it's still the best tasting coffee around.  Coupled with our marvelous Bunn coffee maker (also an Amazon purchase) which makes a fresh, hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes, it just doesn't get any better than this.<br />Keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is (it fluctuates up and down quite a bit) and when you can catch it at a great deal, buy some.

B000VHJPKI,"Yeah, yum.. If you like candied liquid smoke. I've never tried Walden Farm's before but the idea of 0 calorie, scratch that, *TRACE* calories and zero carbs. Wait, there's Splenda and it has half a carb per serving, plus tomato paste which also has carbs and other things on the ingredients that you can't de-carb.<br />Anyways, I digress, the idea of very little calories and very little carbs sounded too good to be true and yep. I drizzled it onto a grilled chicken wrap and bit in. Oh my god. The first thing to hit was a overly sweetness and not a real one, the chemical kind, bletch. The next thing to hit was a smokey taste, and again, not a very good one. It was way too strong and chemical tasting.<br />It ruined my wrap. I should have tasted it separately, but I thought for sure it couldn't be that bad, plus the taste of the Cajun seasonings on the chicken would help hide the taste. I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of the wrap where the liquid fool's gold had collected and bit through, it was way too much. I spit it out and threw the rest away. And all this from a small drizzle down the middle, after all, I was trying it.<br />I couldn't imagine pouring this on something and grilling that nastiness into it.<br />The other reviewers who gave it 5 stars. I don't know what they were thinking. Or maybe Walden Farm's changed the recipe but I didn't get spicy at all in this. It was a bottle of chemically candied chemical smoke flavor.<br />Absolutely horrid. I'd advise staying away unless you like wasting money, not just on this bottle of septic tank juices, but anything it touches. I must now to gargle Listerine and brush.",1

But again, 34 grams of sugar, wow.  It's also only 8 ounces.  I tried the strawberry kiwi, it left a syrupy taste in my mouth.  I would not purchase again, just because of the sugar level.  If you disregard than it is a good drink nevertheless.",4
B001LG945O,"It's a refreshing drink when served cold. A bit sweet when warm. A little tart, but tolerably so.<br /><br />The flavor is less orange than tangerine, yet I can distinguish several different ""layers"" of citrus in it, including the orange. It's an interesting sensation.<br /><br />I am a little bugged by the fact that an 8.3oz can (2/3rd-size) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full-sized can of cola. It's also supposed to be 100% juice, but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are ""natural flavors"" noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of MSG, probably added with the citric acid.<br /><br />So, maybe it's not an especially healthy beverage.

B001RVFDOO,"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!"".",2

The strikes me as a lot of calories for such a tiny bar. Let's compare it to another health food, Greek yogurt, specifically Chobani yogurt.<br /><br />A single 170g cup of Chobani non-fat Greek yogurt only has 140 calories, and no calories from fat. So the Pure bar has three times as many calories per gram than the yogurt. But wait, there's more!<br /><br />Pure touts that the bars contain 7g of protein. Compared to Chobani, it again comes up short -- the single serving of Chobani has 14g of protein (28% of your Daily Value). The Chobani also has 20% of your daily calcium value. And if you thought a benefit of the Pure bar is that it is gluten-free, so is the Chobani.<br /><br />I know that this review seems like it has morphed into a pitch for Chobani, but my point is to illustrate that there are healthier, lower caloric snack foods out there. And the Chobani tastes a heck of a lot better.",1

It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.

B0041NYV8E,"I've never been the greatest fan of ginger drinks. I tend to associate ginger-ale with saltine crackers and the flu, so you can guess how often I tend to drink ginger flavored drinks. The one time I tried ginger beer, I about ejected it through my nostrils due to the fierce swallowing resistance in my throat. That said, I found this beverage surprisingly tasty and easy to drink. The individual foil pouches are easy to open with the built in ""tear notch"". The mixture is tiny brown granules that look like Japanese hon-dashi (if you know what that is). It mixes with hot water to make a sickly brown liquid that looks like something between tea with a bit of milk or coffee with a bunch of milk. There is a heavy ginger scent with a lemony overtone. As for the taste, make no mistake: this has a strong ginger flavor with only the slightest hint of lemon and sugar. The sweetness is not reminiscent of honey (even though it's billed as such), but it's as if the drink was sweetened with a plain spoonful of white sugar. The ginger flavor is not overpowering, but it does tend to linger in the back of the throat with that familiar, persistent medicine-like quality. Even for a decidedly non-ginger-liking guy like me, I drank it up and for the most part, enjoyed it.

B0041NYV8E,"I didn't really love this drink mix, nor did I hate it either. It was just ""ok"". It does mix well and didn't have a bad after taste but the actual taste itself is underwhelming. I think maybe if you like Ginger more than I do you would like it better than I did.",3
B002E0ABTE,"This is a great treat and my Maltese loves them! I love them because of the organic ingredients, no artificial coloring or flavors, and it's low cal, which means I can offer her an extra treat now and then.

B0062A87HA,"True, the cans often have very minor dents (why they're at Amazon), but at least with the ones I bought the top rims were fine, so you can certainly still open them with a can opener.

In any case, I've mentioned this around and then a box of Panda Soft Licorice appeared in my Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Panda licorice is good. Real good. Excellent flavor. Nice and chewy. Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",5

B0007A0AQW,"I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away. I fed the dogs one each then thought I better not give them anymore. I emailed the company and asked if that was normal. Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the ""best by"" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog.

I had never fed the chicken flavor before.<br />I think Iwill be sending these back. I am very disappointed, I don't mind treats that stink I feed a freeze dried green trip treat those really smell. The Zukes didn't smell like something even dogs would eat.",1

After he's done with his main meal, he often says ""bar'"" as if asking for a little desert treat and I know exactly what he means. He wants one of the Special K Bars. Well, OK, but I' somewhat against giving him this kind of ""candy"" food. One thing is certain, he likes the bars and one bar will calm him down.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",4

While they are a good amount hotter than regular red pepper flakes, they don't even measure up to a habanero. Given the Ghost Pepper is 4x hotter, I expected to get at least that much heat. These flakes are about the heat level of the cayenne powder I get at the grocery store.<br /><br />I know the Ghost Pepper is the hottest chile pepper in the world (actually, it's now 2nd - the Trinidad Scorpion captured that title earlier this year), but these flakes don't taste like they really came from something that hot.",2

The kids even used pieces of the food for training games and he eagerly participated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dog and I have a different idea of what smells good.  Large amounts of soy give my dog (just a year old) horrendous gas.  I actually didn't read the label before I fed it to him which was completely my fault.  I assumed that a dog food marketed as gourmet would have better quality ingredients.<br /><br />It clearly is very palatable to dogs.

B007M83302,"I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked.",4

B004MO6NI8,"""What's not to like about an energy drink that comes in a black can with a cracked skull with wings and the words ""NO FEAR"" emblazoned across the top, right? Well...<br /><br />It tastes sort of like carbonated strawberry or grape, a slight pucker-inducing dull fruity taste. Not bad, just not delicious. It's sort of par for the course when it comes to energy drinks. If you like Monster, Amp or Red Bull, this should be just fine. If you drink your coffee black, this will be a huge improvement unless you just love that mud-like taste.<br /><br />As far as energy, this has about the same effect on me as the Monster and Amp line of energy drinks: it gives me a subtle energy boost, and that's a good thing. Red Bull leaves me feeling wired and edgy and I don't want to waste the extra kick by sitting around vibrating, feeling restless and hating how my skin feels like it's crawling. The caffeine in a can of this is on the low end of an average cup of coffee, but it's also loaded up with taurine, l-carnitine and arginine, as well as things like vitamins B and C--things that seem to have some other potential health benefits other than just getting me through an afternoon energy slump (assuming there's enough of those things in there to be useful).<br /><br />Overall, I give this 3 stars. It does the job, doesn't taste unpleasant or leave a nasty after-taste, and falls within the price range I'm accustomed to with other similar energy drinks. It doesn't stand out as being better than other energy drinks I've tried, though, but would have earned an extra star if it tasted a bit better.",3
B000P49A0W,"It is almost impossible to find chocolate that is low carb, and doesn't contain sucralose or malitol.  This candy is completely unique in that the sweetener is erythritol - no carbs, no toxic artificial junk, no sickening malitol.  I can eat these without raising my blood sugar or making my tummy complain violently.  That is the good part.<br /><br />Here are the negatives:  My family likes them, too, and I cannot make a box last long around my house - and these ARE NOT CHEAP!  That is why I gave it only 4 stars - I think the people who make these bars are raking in an obsene profit because they can - this product is one of a kind - No Competition and so the price is sky high.  I don't think the chocolate is any better quality than comparable chocolate bars for half the price or less, but this company has inflated the cost of ChocoPerfection to indecent levels because they have the market cornered on a specialty product.  Not uncommon, but kind of unfair to their customers.<br /><br />All the same, treats like this are so rare in my low carb, diabetic world, that I will buy these anyway.  And I will watch the pantry like a hawk to keep my non diabetic kin-folk out of the goodies!",4

B0081XIA1E,"I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles.",2

I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic four months ago and despite taking insulin I couldn't get my blood sugar under control; I made the switch to LCHF and  less than a month later reduced my insulin by half and again by half and today I manage my diabetes without any insulin, pill or injection.  A reviewer used the analogy of eating rubber bands and another, cartilage and both are right.

Once you get the cooking down right, they're a great snack!",4

It was not until I cut the rest of the can with some vanilla flavored soy milk and ice that it tasted ""good"" to me.

I wanted the no mess option for my home kitchen. It would save me money, it would save me time. So I read the reviews and I purchased it after serious consideration.<br />I am disappointed. All I could taste when I drank it, was a sort of powdered milk taste - it reminded me of coffee creamer which I never drink (the last time was stuck waiting for a car service at Midas three or four years ago). So if you really like your espresso and froth, this will not cut it. If you were having a party and your guests were not foodies, or wanted coffee in the morning in a rush, or if you don't mind the taste of coffee creamer, then this is not the worst espresso drink I have ever had. It compares to an average restuarant that serves this type of drink BUT does [not] compare to a coffee house despite the claims on the box.<br />See my review on the Cafe Lungo option if you want to know what it tastes like when you remove the milk capsule as a factor...",1

I'd guess that an entire bag has the equivalent of one strawberry sliced, diced, and dried. I definitely wanted more! The chocolate chunks are also tasty but sort of few and far between. The granola itself is quite good (albeit a little oatmeal-cookie sweet). But if Love Crunch is going to make chocolate and red berries so prominent on the packaging, they really should make sure that not a mouthful will go by in which you don't get at least a taste of one of those extras. As those components are obviously added after the fact (they're not embedded in the granola itself) they really should be a little more generous.",3

This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I don't think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy/sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure I'd buy this again.

This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers.

B000G671R8,"These are really awesome - the flavor is unexpected, but perfect; gives a boost to ""plain old"" pork rinds - lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt/vinegar chips!!!  In addition, the company is quite pleasant to deal with, and all the other products I've tried are delicious and a good bargain, too.",5
B001E77LT6,"I have a 4-year-old son and I try to at least partly manage his nutrition. Sometimes he'll eat almost anything we put in front of him and sometimes he'll eat almost nothing. It's these latter episodes that bother me, so I try to have some snack foods around just to be sure that he gets enough. Take chocolate milk, for example. I can almost always get a glass in him and it's good nutrition. Another item is whole-grain fruit bars. I shop at Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Markets and usually buy their store brand. They're whole grain and organic and taste rather  good. If I give one to the boy it will almost always disappear in short order. Well, the last time I was there they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-grain Cereal Bars on half-price sale. I should have known better than to pick up a box of eight of the strawberry variety. I had one and it tasted fine, although I don't think it was as good as the store brand. My son wouldn't eat it. He just took one bite and that was it. I tried again the next day and got the same result. I don't understand it, but there's something about these bars that he just doesn't like. Well, maybe the guy has good judgement. I doubt that most people would notice, but he does.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",3
B002IEZJMA,"I usually really like coffee drinks, but I have never tasted anything this horrible in my life.  I have had a variety of other brands and this was the worst flavor I have had.  I would not recommend this one based on its flavor.  Maybe if this brand has other flavored ones it would be better, but the plain coffee one is horrible.  I do not recommend.",1
B002LANN56,"I'd heard that Chef Michaels was an affordable, good-for-your-dog food because it contained pure protein and vegetables. That's true, but there are also lots of junk ingredients that make it junk food for dogs. I won't argue that my puppy loves the taste. He's a finicky eater and has been since we brought him home, he hates seafood and lamb, and how his breeder got him to eat Taste of the Wild is beyond me, I question if she really fed him TOTW because he won't touch it.<br /><br />We can get him to eat Innova's chicken with no grains food, my preferred brand, but he will go a full day without eating anything before he'll touch it. And we even withhold treats to make sure he's good and hungry. The vet had us try a bunch of options, nothing worked, and weight loss became a worry after a full month of this pattern. Chef Michaels he eats willingly, so I've been mixing in a tablespoon into his good food and that seems to be the only way I've found to get him to clean his bowl. It's not an ideal method, but at least he's eating, and the vet said go with it and try to reduce the junk food amount over time, so we're giving that a shot.<br /><br />I won't pan Chef Michaels completely as it does have vegetables, barley, and beef in the ingredients. It's still not the best option out there though.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows, and it's the soy, ground corn, corn gluten, by-products, ground wheat, and flavorings that aren't great.<br /><br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.

It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.",3

B00002N8SM,"Like others have said, hanging this up is useless. You have to lie it down in an area where the flies like to land. I have caught dozens and dozens of flies with this, however I have noticed that some of these traps are stickier than others. The flies in my house also seem to have figured out how to basically ""walk"" down the trap until they get to the end, where they can get unstuck and fly off. Maybe 25% of the flies escape, and the others are trapped. I actually have taken to pressing the flies into the trap once they land, to try to keep them from escaping, but this is disturbing and I'd rather not have to do that. The Catchmaster Window glue trap is really superior to this product by comparison (but is currently unavailable...).",3

B006Q7YFLQ,My dog loves these treats!  They are a good all natural product which I have no issues or concerns with giving it to my dog.  I feed my dog Wellness Core because he cannot eat grains due to skin allergies.  So to find a good quality grain free treat that my dog likes is great.  I break the treats into 4 pieces because of the cost.  Four ounces for almost 11 dollars is quite costly.  That means these treats are 44 dollars a pound!! I won't be buying much of these treat very often because of the cost.  Sorry Natural Instinct....you have a great product line but 44 dollars a pound is ridiculous!  This isn't filet mingnon people!

B002B8ODPW,"As for the taste of the product, it tastes just like evaporated whole milk to me.  It does not have the creamy mouth-feel of regular half-n-half.  I know that this is from treating it for long term shelf life, but I would not invest the money in it when you can get evaporated milk on sale quite often and it has a much longer shelf life.<br /><br />I ordered 2 boxes of this and one box was leaking so bad that FedEx would not deliver it.  The other appeared fine but inside had leaked everywhere and it took forever for me to find one container that wasn't leaking to try the product. The box was packed pretty good, the flat of cartons were wrapped in bubble wrap but with a bit of empty space in the box; so it is a 50/50 chance the cartons are just leaky or damage happened during shipping from shifting around in empty space during transit.<br /><br />Either way, Amazon customer service was wonderful about fixing the problem, but I will not be reordering.",2

These are the best biscuits but unfortunately very very bad packing. these are pretty brittle and it breaks easily, this time i got with about 5 of the packs almost fully crushed, 3 were total powdered. I would never take it again from amazon, i get it way cheaper in indian groceries, just that stock there keeps getting over and i have to find the right time to get it . but it is better than eating powder.  So somehow review is complicated, since the product is good and amazon has nothing to do with it, the only thing amazon has to do is handling and shipping, which is very badly done.

B000FOOIVI,"The product arrived on time and was the correct flavor type.  There was a problem though; when I opened the brown shipping box, it looked like whoever shipped it opened up my product and took out one of the pouches (it was a 12-pouch pack, the kind you would set up in a grocery store).  I also ordered a different flavor at the same time from the same company, and that box was also missing a pouch.  So in total, I was screwed out of 2 pouches of gum.  I didn't bother sending the product back or complaining because let's face it, the trouble wasn't worth the $2 that the gum was worth.

B002LANN56,"The rating is one star because the dog liked it a lot and one star in thanks for the Vine program which allows us to try products without spending good money on them.<br /><br />My dog is 130 Mastiff and he did not like or eat the Beneful dog food that we reviewed a few months ago. Not so with this bag. He was interested in the smell as soon as I opened the bag and ate the whole bowl when it was placed in front of him. He is not a dog who is normally interested in food. He doesn't beg at the table, shows no interest in scraps and usually has to have wet food mixed in with the dry before he will eat. His preferred diet is couches, dog beds, remotes, eyeglasses, and a 9"" ratchet wrench. Yet he likes this food. I wonder what the attraction is , since he usually shuns table scrap meats.<br /><br />In spite of the fancy name, the colorful textured kibble, the grilled sirloin label, this bag is full of stuff that is not good for dogs as a daily diet. Too much soy, soy products, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />We will be using this bag as a training treat, because he seems to like the taste, but we are still on a hunt for real, unadulterated, healthy food.",2

I eat half the box at a time, which is about 4 ozs, and it's so filling I can't eat more if I wanted. It keeps me satiated all night. I don't even get the urge to snack. This is like a miracle to me.  Even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the ""real"" (and unhealthy) alternative. The other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2 - 5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says.  I'm not sure if Amazon will like this comment, but it is much cheaper on the Fiber Gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day I am writing this review.",5
B0018OMTOM,I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone.

B0081XIA1E,"I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My ""boys"" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL  but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be ""released"" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys. Plus, the price has been great and I found it at my local canine speciality store too!",4
B002DHL6II,"i guess its because i LOVE sugar that this particular item tasted only a little bit less than cardboard!

I've ordered these before and I am still thrilled with the product.",4
B0009X2A60,"We had a problem with this cat food. All of my cats but one developed loose stools on this cat food. It took me several bags of cat food to figure out that it was this cat food that was causing the problem because it did not kick in right off the bat. I had been mixing this with their old dry food and I was supplementing with canned food during the transition, so it took a bit to narrow down this new food as the source. The smaller cats developed the diarrhea before the larger cats did. I believe there is just a bit too much fiber in this formulation or perhaps it is the berries in the ingredients that trigger the loose stools. I would not have a problem mixing this with Iams or Science Diet if I could figure out the threshold where the loose stools starts. For now, I'm just going to stick to supplementing with canned food, which has almost no filler in it. On a final note, the cats were not thrilled with this. They would eat it but would go for any other food in the house before they would eat this, if given a choice.",3

The flavor is good, although I wouldn't mind if the syrup was a little thicker, especially when used on ice cream.  I enjoy mixing it in a glass of low-fat milk, adding a shot or less of Kahlua or Tia Maria, and putting it in the freezer for several hours.  Makes a tasty frozen treat.<br /><br />I especially want to thank the Amazon seller from whom I purchased this product.  In addition to shipping the six squeeze bottles in a cardboard box, Lil-BigShots took the time to wrap them in pairs inside protective bubble-wrap mailing envelopes.

B000KV61FC,"I have purchased many Premier brand products and liked them, especially the Busy Buddy dog toys.  However, the Tug-a-jug is not one of them.  The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged.  My dog stopped playing with it due to that.  The  tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.  Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!  I did buy it in 2009 but my dog hardly ever played with it so I am not sure how long they would last if a dog played with it frequently.  Premier has so many other wonderful dog toys to chose from.",2

B005CUU25G,"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.",1
B002LANN56,"I've never seen my lab mixes so excited for any type of dog food before. They absolutely love it, even to the point of trying to crawl under the table to chase down a runaway piece. They eat is so fast, they're practically inhaling it so I've taken to mixing it in with their regular food. Unfortunately it really is junk food for dogs with very little nutritional content. I won't go into the long list of ingredients, but there is little to recommend it as a healthy alternative. I'm giving it 3 stars because I figure it's a balance between 5 stars for taste and 1 star for nutrition. I was also rather put off by how big the package looked, but how empty it felt. It's sold by weight, I know, but I'd estimate at least 25% of the packaging could be eliminated there was so much air in the bag.",3

B0047E2I5U,"We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.",4
B004DJ243U,"I bought this tea as a gift for someone who had it at a tea and liked it. Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent. This tea just didn't work for me on any level.<br /><br />You may want to try the Rishi or Bentleys. They are more expensive but they taste better. You may be very underwhelmed by this tea compared to them.",2

B002FYXEDE,"These ends do a great job for the heavy chewer, safe and yummy. Unfortunately (sp) Amazon has these things listed all over the place so it is tuff to do a simple comment or price on the bone. $3.70 is right price ea. but buy the 10 pack cuz you get the really big bones in there.",5
B001RVFDOO,"Amazing concept... not fried, not even baked... Popped like Popcorn... !!!!<br />This is another product for my Weight Watchers regima. Each bag is only 2 points.. I love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch. They taste really good.. my favorite are the Bar-b-que, Salt & Vinegar, and the Sour Cream.. they are all good though.",5
B002WW3C0Y,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas in a nice glass jar from Old Time Pottery. My boyfriend thought they would last forever but they were gone by March. People would come to his cubicle just to take a few. My only complaint is that 1/6 of the bag came stuck together. They easily broke apart but made one side of a lot of the beans flat. This was mailed in December but I guess the warm Georgia winter melted them in transit. For the price, I hoped that all of them would be intact. Taste was not compromised though. Yum!",4
B0030VBRIU,"My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes sour. The taste of tomato is too strong. Tomato has lycopene, a antioxidant for good health, but my son just won't eat. He like other happy baby productx like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.",2
B001EQ55RW,"When I opened this plastic jar of roasted almonds, I expected something like chocolate-covered peanuts a la almond.  Nope, that's not what happened.  It turned out that these are almonds that are dusted in cocoa.  The chocolate flavor is really rich, mainly because it's dark chocolate.  I like these as a treat, and I realized that they'd go really well with a cup of coffee.  They aren't snack food, unless the snacker has really odd sense of taste.  I found that they're best if you just eat about two or three of them at a time, with or without coffee.  Come to think of it, I'll likely brew me up a cup of a rich French or African roast, just because that cup of java would go well with this treat.  Be careful, however, when opening the container because the pungent flavor might make you sneeze.  More than three dusted almonds will also likely dry out your mouth.",4

B001IZHSWO,"I've been a fan of Jack Links beef jerky for a long time.  This product, however, sorta scares me now that I've tried it.  They are dyed red and don't have a sausage-like consistency at all.  That is, this isn't a hard sausage.  It's like highly processed meat (including pork hearts!).  Under the red skin, they're really mushy, almost like pÃ¢t&eacute; or a soft hot dog.  An individually wrapped red, soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good, but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.  Make sure to try one before buying in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not condemning the product or people who like it.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Your mileage may vary.",3

Luckily my cats aren't picky and they ate the leftovers.<br /><br />This dog food also has some strange textures and smells, at least to my senses. Also as some other reviews mentioned, there is a lot of Soy products in this and that can give some dogs gas.<br /><br />Price wise, it is a little expensive for the size of the bag. For its price, I would want a dog food I know she will eat and that is not this one.",3
B000UXA0KM,"The product description did not include the fact that this salt also contains magnesium carbonate.  Despite that, it seems ""moist"".  The crystals don't make hard lumps but they also don't flow freely like some other brands of sea salt that I've had in the past.  It is difficult to use this salt in a salt shaker.<br /><br />This is the only Roland product I've purchased that has been less than satisfactory. I do not believe I would order it again.",2
B001GVISJW,"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!",5
B0041NYV8E,"Was so excited to try this. I received one single serving and was rather disappointed I didn't get a box as I love lemon, my very favorite flavor. I mixed it with the 8 oz of hot water and it doesn't quite look like the box, mine was darker. First sip and I was very disappointed, yikes it is ginger to the max. I like ginger but this is almost ginger gone bad and I couldn't taste the lemon at all. Now I was glad I had only one packet.<br /><br />Wanting to give it another chance I put it in the fridge and later added ice to see if it was any better. The answer was no. It made me feel kind of sick and that is strange because ginger is so good for the stomach. I had no ingredients to look at on the pack all I know it was made in Singapore. If you like SERIOUS ginger then this is for you.",1
B004P13CN2,"This works, tastes better than other similar products (though I don't think any energy shot product can really taste GOOD) and was much less expensive than others. It's really sweet and tart but doesn't leave the bad taste in your mouth I've experienced with stuff like 5 hr energy. I've gone through about half of them, and I don't take the whole thing at once usually half in the morning and half around lunchtime. ""Cons"" might include that the part of the plastic that provides the bottle's seal is not always easy to remove cleanly (doesn't follow perforation, and it can be kind of annoying) and that on a couple bottles (so far 2 of 11) have dried up dirty brownish looking product in the threaded part of the cap (another reviewer may have mentioned this as well). It's nothing that's going to kill you and I usually can just wipe it off, but it's a little bit unappetizing.<br />Overall this is a good alternative to drinking coffee or soda and I'd buy it again if I need more when they're all gone.",4

Great product great buy!",4
B001QW6N6Q,"Long wait! I suppose it's my fault for ordering from the webstore as I am in CA and I think this comes from the east coast so it took forever to get here. My dog and I are loving this food so far. TMI but seriously, her poos are so small and barely smell. She liked it dry, which is kind of funny, but I do wet it sometimes. The feeding guidelines are a little ambiguous, so I plan to call Addiction directly. As for the store (Whole Health Pet, I believe), they are great! As I mentioned the wait was long, but I ordered from them twice and both times received a couple of samples and goodies for my dog; a sample packet of another grain-free Addiction flavor and a freeze dried meat treat - great attention to detail!",3
B00154KOG0,These candies are more like chocolate-dipped decorations than anything you should eat.  A terribly expensive waste of lovely chocolate.  It gets two stars because they are pretty and would last forever without fear of rotting while festively decorating the inside of a candy dish.,2
B000ETGBOQ,"I think Depeche Mode said it the best ""I Just Can't Get Enough"" and that is how I feel about these crackers.  They have a WONDERFUL flavor and are low in fat and calories.  A serving size is 17 crackers.  These are a great alternative to basic potato chips, macaroni salad and/or french fries.  Great by themselves, with dip or along your favorite sandwich.  Once you open a package you will be amazed how long before you're opening another.",5
B0009PM5DQ,"I had high hopes for this product. I was looking for sweet ""saladitos"", which is what they're called in Mexico, and a favorite treat I grew up on. All the ingredients looked right, and when the bags arrived, the plums in the two bags looked different, but i figured maybe one was just older, or maybe a different batch and dried differently, but that they would taste the same in the end. After finishing off the first bag without much appreciation, I moved onto the second and was SO disappointed to find that basically they forgot to salt them. They were too sweet, and that's basically it. All I tasted was sweet and no salt. I haven't really touched that bag and am so upset that I spent a small fortune on it. The ones in the picture are how the first bag looked, the second bag looked moist and dark. I didn't want to go through the trouble to try to return it, so hopefully someone will just see this review and do quality checks before they start sending out unfinished products. SIGH. So much for my pregnancy craving going away.",2

OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product.

The vinaigrette recipe on the can is phenomenal - I mix up a couple of cups of it and keep it in a squeeze bottle in the fridge, use it on greens, antipasto, and grilled chicken.  I use the oil straight for the finishing touch on a lot of items.  Recently I found myself with a last-minute invitation to dinner and not a lot of ingredients in the house to throw together a contribution - settled on a white bean bruscetta with a drizzle of this oil, and people swooned.  It elevates everything it touches.",5

B002DLXXHG,"I ordered this product because it was described as ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" and the gold box price price was good.  It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities.",2

One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle.

No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war and it was really intended for our soldiers.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of ""Juicy Fruit"".

I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.

B007ZUFLY8,My dog and others love this treat. The problem is that hundreds and thousands of dogs have died in the US after consuming these treats. One death was that of a good friend as it killed her beautiful German Shepard.  Her death was completely avoidable because the problem with these treats was known but not publically shared. Purina claims these treats are safe and yet hundreds of dogs have died after eating them.  These treats are made in China where the problem first occured with dog and cat food years ago. Back then the problems resulted in the same initial denial.  Please read related articles on this subject and make an informed decision about purchasing these treats.,1
B000CSCOXQ,"I tried one of these and thought it was pretty good, but not enough for breakfast for me.  I don't eat a lot at one time, but it wasn't that filling.  Maybe with a piece of fruit and a drink it could be breakfast. (Honestly, I prefer the chocolate peanut butter bars from South Beach Living--awesome).<br /><br />Anyway, this vanilla crisp cereal bar is 90 calories, 2g protein, 10% niacin, thiamin, vitamin B6, and riboflavin (again, compare it to the South Beach Living Peanut Butter Chocolate bar). The vanilla crisp bar is tasty, a little sweet but not too bad, and crunchy like a rice krispy bar. It has a drizzle of what tastes like white icing on top. It's a lot better than many of these bars.<br /><br />If you are eating these as a low-cal snack or to have something in the car to keep your sugar count from blitzing out, then ok, sure.  But if you are doing a diet thing, you need to have a satisfying meal experience. If you feel ""cheated"" out of breakfast, you are likely to go off your diet.  Most diet gurus tell you to eat 3 - 6 reasonable and satisfying meals a day. And as someone who lost 59 lbs 1-2 years ago, I agree.<br /><br />By the way--bars contain wheat, milk, and soy ingredients. (I know some people are allergic to these ingredients.)",4

B004CYLW7A,This is a very nice cereal.  It is very crunchy and is sweetened with honey.

B004W7T9VI,The vendor is fast and dependable. The tea is simply the best way to relax and great tasting too. Highly recommend !!,5
B007I7Z3Z0,"There's only one thing keeping me from giving this a solid 4 star rating: the aftertaste, which I'll get more into later.<br /><br />First, the good. Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.<br /><br />It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.<br /><br />Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.<br /><br />Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.<br /><br />3.4/5",3

B000F4H5F4,"This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the ""fannings"" or ""dust"" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I don't think of it as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)",4
B007JFMH96,I was disappointed in these cookies. They are expensive and I should not have looked at the nutrition label .

If I am going ot put that many calories in my  mouth it had better be worth it and these cookies are not worth it! The only good thing nutrition wise is they have 4 grams  of fiber.

I almost felt like vomiting because I could not stand the strange sour wheat flavor. It even smells sour too..almost similar to the faint smell of toe jams.<br /><br />Overall, the concept was great, but the flavor and smell was too much for me to handle.<br />I really wanted to like it, but I didn't.<br /><br />This bar may be great if you don't mind the flavor and smell.<br />I'm gonna try freezing them and attempting to eat them another time. I'll see if I will grow to like the unique flavor and smell. I have so many bars to finish :(",2

B00382UXU4,"I purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn, and it's a healthy snack.<br /><br />I 'accidentally' ordered the white popcorn, having no idea what I was doing, and I have to say that no other popcorn compares. We went through the entire container. When I re-ordered, I decided to try the regular yellow popcorn, and it just wasn't the same. If I could describe the difference, I would say that yellow popcorn tastes 'stale' in comparison. The white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, we use Kernel Seasons seasoning generously, so we don't taste much more than the cheddar cheese :)<br /><br />I'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so I have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn.<br /><br />For how we eat it, this popcorn is absolutely the best!<br /><br />NOTE: I also recommend the Misto oil spray. We use this and Kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter.",5

B007POT6RM,"Everything I said about the Cinnamon and Spice version applies to this.  And what I said was:<br /><br />It's oatmeal that tastes like cinnamon and spice.  Just like the box says.  The oatmeal is good enough, and quick to make. Obviously it isn't as high quality as really good oatmeal, but if you just want quick and reasonably tasty, as well as cheap - well, this is for you.<br /><br />Except remove the 'cinnamon and spice' and replace with 'Maple Brown Sugar'.  Well, except the first time, because then this review would be self referential.",4
B004TI4SIE,"The packets make an easy and quick way to make a spicy and sweet ginger tea. However, I prefer using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029JDDE"">Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy (5.25oz)</a> to make my tea. Every packet has 17g of sugar, yet doesn't taste as sweet as Ting Ting Jahe in my opinion, which has only 3g per piece of candy. I also think that Ting Ting Jahe has a cleaner ginger flavor, but isnt as spicy as this product. This product also takes up more space and isnt as good a value as ting ting jahe. If you are looking for the quickest way to make a drink, these packets are the way to go. However, if you are willing to stir around the ginger candies until they dissolve, the ting ting jahe candies make a much better tasting drink, with less sugar and a cleaner finish. Plus, you can eat them as regular candies if you wish!",3
B001E5E1MI,"I purchased oil primarily for use in making popcorn. I was told that coconut oil was what the movie theaters used to make their popcorn so good. The oil is good, not movie theater great, but better that vegetable oil. My complaint and the reason I give it a three out of five is the packaging. It's cheap. Real cheap. The container was tipped over on the counter (did not fall, just tipped 90 degrees) and the plastic container popped the plastic top right off along with half the oil. A more sturdy container would have been make this a non-issue. Hope they make it stronger in the future.",3
B001717U9U,The potatos and hot dogs are really good.... In fact they are great and will order again. The steaks and burgers are crap. Steaks are very chewy and dry. The burgers are too.... Id rather eat bubba burgers... They are much better.,2
B001JYVTNS,I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.,4

B0019CSQ36,"This was actually a little nasty.  I love beef jerky.  When I purchased this I thought: I like cheap jerky from Walmart, so how bad could it be?  It actually pretty bad.  It may be cheap, but still not worth it.  Put a few dollars with it and buy a different brand that tastes a little better.<br /><br />(This stuff is also full of MSG and gave me a headache after an ounce of it.  Other jerky might have MSG too, but this brand's amount was more noticeable to me.)",1

B000KV61FC,"I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)",1

He's gotten them for me the last two Christmas. And every year, I dare to hope they've gone back to the earlier formula, but alas, I've been sorely disappointed the last two years. They currently are not melt-in-your mouth, more of a suck and crunch, and then kinda gooey. I'll probably get them again, optimist that I am, in hopes they change the formula back to the grandeur it was.",3
B000FA38ZE,"I wouldn't feed this to a pet.  Though the nutritional info shows '0 Trans Fats' the ingredients list shows ""Partially Hydrogenated"" oils... that is Trans Fats.  Basically, natural oils that have been modified by attaching two hydrogen molecules where they don't occur in nature.  The end result... the oil is solid a room temperature and creates a crispier product.  The impact to your health is that your system thinks it is oil (fat) and lets it into your blood stream where it is handled like a plastic.  You system doesn't know what to do with it and it is plastered on the walls of your arteries where it stays for a long long time.  Folks... if you care about Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol problems, altheimers disease... maybe more.  Keep these Trans Fats away from yourself and loved ones.  Also this material is hidden in names like ""shortening"" and ""margarine"".  Don't buy this... find a wafer that is safe.",1

My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)",4
B0041NYV8E,"Each packet dissolves instantly in 250 ml of hot water.  The smell of the beverage is lemony, almost like a cleaning product.  The taste is spicey/hot/lemon.

I like the flavor, but I can tell it's one of those tastes that get old really quickly.",4
B00094JEUO,"This drink is absolutely great. It has less calories, sugars, and sodium than Pepsi or Coke products, plus it tastes great.

If you're looking for an all natural, tasty drink, you've found it- Izze Sodas.<br /><br />The reason this review is 4 Stars is because the pricing here on Amazon is ridiculous. Aren't you supposed to get a deal when you buy by the case? I purchase an Izze everyday at work for $1.69... you do the math. I can literally buy more by purchasing them individually.<br /><br />So while this soda is spectacular, do yourself a favor and find a better price. C'mon Amazon.",4

If you love things like lemon meringue pie, you will adore this luscious,lemony spread on grahams, pound cake, etc.  Just a thin layer of this delicious confection enlivens your taste buds with an explosion of flavor.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a very special treat.",5

B004MO6NI8,No Fear comes in a 16 oz can. The can contains two servings (total 260 calories per can).<br />I don't know of many people who would drink half of this can and then store the rest for later or share it.<br />This stuff tasted sweeter than regular soda and probably is. It also has a bitter taste almost like grapefruit.<br />It was bad it just wasn't good to me. The first two ingredients were Carbonated water and High fructose corn syrup.<br />There is way too much sugar in this for me. I didn't really feel an energy kick. I would not use it again.,3

I've even bought this as a gift for ladies working to slim down before weddings.  My husband can add as much as he cares to his protein shakes and I mix it for an apple dip.  I tastes like peanutbutter, because IT IS.  They have just pressed the fat out.  Definite staple for the shelf.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I like the PBS chocolate powdered peanut butter even better.",4

B0017OCOYI,These things taste like jumping off a diving board feet first into an over-chlorinated swimming pool.

B000EH2AMA,"Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight.",5

B002AR14WO,"I shared this product with a person in my office who drinks tea daily.  (I'm a big coffee drinker, so I don't drink tea every day.)<br /><br />My initial impression was that while this tea smelled good once the bag was opened, the tea itself had almost no aroma once brewed and the tea didn't have much flavor either.  I thought that perhaps I had not brewed it long enough even though I had brewed it a full 5 minutes (the manufacturer recommends brewing 3-5 minutes), so I threw the bag back in my cup of tea.  Despite leaving the bag in the cup as I finished drinking the tea, the tea never got much flavor as far as I was concerned.  Then again I'm used to drinking really strong coffee, so I thought that perhaps my taste buds were simply used to a stronger flavor.<br /><br />Enter my co-worker.  I specifically did not tell her my impression of the tea because I wanted her unbiased opinion.  She was excited by the description of the tea on the box and brewed a cup for herself as she normally does every morning at the beginning of the work day.  She just stopped by my desk to give me her feedback.  Her main description of the tea was ""bland.""  She said it did not taste bad, but that it did not have much flavor.  In other words, her perception of this tea matched mine.  She further added that she would not buy this tea.  She didn't even want the rest of the box from me, so I'm simply going to put it out in our lunchroom in the hopes that perhaps some people where I work will enjoy it.  Who knows -- maybe this tea will impress at least one of my coworkers and they'll decide to purchase this tea.  I know I wouldn't.",2
B008FHUDW0,"Caribou makes a series of coffees; my current favorite is Mahogany. However, this, too is nice on the palate. The package describes the taste thus: ""Caribou blend begins with a delightful heaviness on your palate and finishes with a relaxing balance of bittersweet chocolate and fruity flavors.""<br /><br />For tree huggers and environmentalists, Caribou--as a company--is a member of the Rainforest Alliance, designed to ""protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that depend on them. . . .""<br /><br />The coffee? I like it. It is not my favorite K-cup product, but it is tasty.

B00139C3P2,"I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.",1
B001R5QS0S,I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).

I'm upset still.,2
B004NCBF46,"I was searching for a turmeric tea and being familiar with the Rishi brand, decided it would  be a safe choice.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by the flavor. It is strong, but I don't find it over powering.  I am accustomed to strong tasting teas though, so if you're a novice tea drinker, you might find it quite strong or even distasteful.  The ginger gives it a nice balance.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for either a ginger or turmeric flavored tea.",4
B004ZIER34,"Being a French Roast lover, I decided I would give this one a shot. I did not receive the pack of 10 like the page suggests but I received just enough to make one pot- 2.25 ounces, I guess this would just be a taste test to let other potential buyers know if it's good or not.<br /><br />The taste i'd give 4 stars. I'm not sure if I would buy it because i'm hooked on one brand of French Roast in particular, but this wasn't a bad cup of coffee by any means. It had a smooth taste, was still somewhat strong despite being smooth but not too much so.<br /><br />It's a smooth full-bodied 100 percent gourmet coffee with half the acid. If you don't like a bitter roast but still want to experience a rich full bodied taste without heartburn, acid reflux or stomach irritation- then this is for you.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish Amazon sent me more-  Recommended.",4
B003DGSDTI,"This is a good product, I'll buy it again, no question. But if you are a sincere chili head, and you better be if you're buying it, it's not as hot as you'd think. Because my temperament has adapted to intense levels of heat, spices/sauces that claim to be beyond insane tend to NOT be as hot as advertised. For serious - SERIOUS - chili heads, on a scale of 1-10, this is about a 7. The salt is really just that - salt. The balance in one bite is about 80 percent salt, 20 percent heat, but that ratio keeps it from being a scorching heat. That being said, I've figured it out enough to know what it's going to taste great on (spaghetti!), what it's going to add nice heat to (wings, of course), and where I can do without it. All in all, a good product that I'll keep regularly stocked in my pantry.",4
B0064MEUS6,"The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care.",1

B0029NTQ1K,"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",3

B000N5XCXO,"I was originally turned on to this brand because of the ingredient list in the wet foods -- no more by-products! -- and vey few (if any) grains, depending on the flavor.

What amazed me is after all that trial and error finding a food for the picky guy, one day he just started eating the surf & turf flavor I bought for the indiscriminate one. Now that he's tasted surf & turf he prefers it over everything else -- they both do. Exceptional product. Their coats look phenomenal and we haven't had an issue with UT issues since moving to Merrick wet food. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last time I ordered with White Dog Bone, the cans came a little crumpled -- nothing so bad that it had to be returned, but it wasn't preferable.",4

B006JGFYY6,"I love Taco Bell's grocery items, so I was excited to try this new rice. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. This is more of an imitation Spanish rice than a Mexican rice. It is tomato based, and very sweet. I expected it to have more of a taco type seasoning (cumin, garlic, etc).I cooked the rice for the recommended amount of time (90 seconds) and this came out very mushy and sticky, mostly clumping together. The flavor was too much for me, since I do not like sweet rice with my tacos. I would not try this again, and I would be hesitant to try another flavor.",2

B0038A5QCQ,"I've ordered this product from Amazon several times over the past year or so and never had a problem.  That changed.<br /><br />When I unwrapped and tasted one of the Biscotti from a recent shipment I got a rather unpleasant taste of what I can only describe as the spice Cumin.<br /><br />I emailed Nonni's customer service to report the problem and got a response along the lines of ""yeah, if the ingredients aren't mixed well you can get a clump of spice which results in an off taste.""<br /><br />Huh?  That's it?  Suck it up, dude?  Who didn't manufacture a quality product...me?<br /><br />I was surprised and disappointed at the apparent lack of concern.<br /><br />So far about 1/2 of the 25-count tub have been consumed and I've found one other that tastes bad.  I won't bother reporting it again because clearly Nonni's manufacturer doesn't care.<br /><br />No more Nonni's product for me.",2

B00166D8TW,"This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...",5
B004CYLW7A,"Since flavor can be so subjective, I will try my best to draw comparisons.  The new Crunchy Nut cereal is similar to Honey Nut Cheerios size.  They're slightly sweeter than Honey Nut Cheerios but with milk added, the flavor reminds me to Corn Pops.  And it's definitely sweeter than your Honey Bunches of Oat available at Costco in the 2 pack.  This cereal doesn't get soggy as fast as Corn Pops or Honey Bunches of Oat.  It's also 100 calories per serving.  I'm more of a Special K with Strawberries type of guy so I enjoy a little sour/fruity flavor along with my sweet cereal.  I hope this review helps in your decision whether to try it or not.",4

I was also not sure whether the tree was dormant and was perhaps supposed to look the way it does (in December.) I'm still hoping it may revive, so I'm hanging on to it. It was intended as a gift to celebrate a marriage, but I couldn't give a dead looking tree in that circumstance.",1
B002RU3GH0,"I've been buying other brands of coconut oil from Amazon such as Nature's Way and Nutiva. Those are good brands. I ran out and I saw this brand at my grocery store so I bought it. First of all, the packaging... it comes in bottle that is just like a shampoo bottle, cheap plastic and not at all appetizing... and then the most ridiculous thing of all is the teeny tiny spout for dispensing the product--coconut oil is a SOLID at room temperature! How are you supposed to dispense a SOLID out of this teeny spout!?!<br /><br />I had to do as others did, I warmed the bottle until the oil melted and I poured it all into another more practical container, a jar. But immediately the oil smells BAD, it has a burnt smell. And unlike the pure white virgin coconut oils from the other suppliers I mentioned, this has a brown tint and some brown gunk that settles to the bottom of the jar. Yuck! This oil is NOT extra virgin, or even virgin coconut oil like the others. It seems very cheap and impure. For all I know they used solvents to extract it. It's very suspect.<br /><br />I used it for cooking until I could buy a better brand. It's OK for on your skin, but that's about it. I will never buy this again.",1
B004R8J8EK,"Have tried it a few ways...including the traditional boneless chicken breast.  Instructions on the package were dead on...made a beautiful breast that had a nice crunchy exterior (fairly thin though...if you wanted thicker you might try egg?  If I try this I'll let you know if it works) and a lovely moist interior<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars was one thing...I personally don't really care for celery as a seasoning and it's very strong in this packet.  For me at least that's not a great thing :(<br /><br />Another great use is just to use it as a general seasoning...works in rice and my boyfriend's ""veggie burgers"" (made of oatmeal and onions)...gives a really nice flavor this way too.",4
B003PFUNU4,I ordered this sampler pack since my husband and I have been on a low carb diet.  Use it to make breakfast shakes with almond milk and ice.

B001GB7IJI,"These were a gift and were as expected except for one detail: these are NOT the regular size Swedish Fish, they are a miniature version.  Each fish measures approximately 1"" long and 1/4"" wide.  Neither the item description here on Amazon nor the product packaging stated anything about this, so the recipient and I were both quite surprised when he opened the bag!  The taste is the same, but I really feel that such a major variation from the customary should be announced so that the consumer is aware of just what it is that they are purchasing.",3

B00139C3P2,We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.,1

Then they say you get more than Orville Redenbocker to try to justify the shrinking package.

B0054TWQ2C,"This is a true convenience food - all you need to add is water and wait a few minutes.  There are a couple of options: add cold water and microwave for three minutes, or boil water, and then wait 3 minutes.  I chose the latter because I didn't like the idea of putting the plastic bowl in the microwave.  After three minutes it was ready - very easy.<br /><br />The flavor is ""spicy chicken"".  Be aware that this is ""spicy"" in the sense that if all you are used to is ketchup, you might notice a tiny bite to this.  If you are used to truly spicy food.....this isn't spicy at all.  I could barely tell there was anything at all that is spicy to the flavoring.<br /><br />One thing I did add to round it out is an egg - it made it sort of like egg drop soup and added a little nutrition to the meal.  It would be fine without this addition but was extra delicious with it.",4

B006H34CUS,"I like these as a quick snack at work.  I just pop them in the microwave to warm them up, and munch away.  It's nice to have the banana bread taste without having to bake any.  I also like that these have some fiber in them to keep things moving along ;)",4
B0085G4ACA,"I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink, it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.<br />The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes, because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.<br />As with all coconut waters, the taste can vary slightly, but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant.",5

B001PLDYAG,"Wow,what ups with this water. The pH of the ""still"" water is 6 and the ""sparkling"" water is 5. Low in TDS, total dissolved minerals, the purer the water the worst it is for your health. Pure water with an acidic pH will actually rob the body (actually your bones) of valuable minerals in an attempt to neutralize the acidity. and the PRICE for all this...let's see. For adequate hydration you should drink 1/2 of your body weight in ozs per day (of healthy restructured) water. So for a 150 person that's 4.43 bottles/day and that would cost you(24 pk of Voss 16.9oz),...$7.18/day, $215/month or $2583.50/yr.<br /><br />So this water that's not really any good for your health if you equate it's price per ounce to a gallon of gasoline, you would be paying $13.35/gallon for your gas.<br /><br />Educate yourselves to what's really going on... to find out more visit www.Hydration-Sense.com",1

BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips.

Anyway, I tried them because I'll try just about anything if someone tells me it's good for me and I'll like it, and as it turns out it is both of those things. These little seeds are about the size of sesame seeds, maybe a little smaller, and have a very mild nutty taste. They can be added to just about anything and are packed with omega fats, fiber and a little protein. They've got fat, but not the bad french fries and cheeseburger kind, the good kind that your body uses to keep your heart and everything else healthy.

Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.

B002ZOPTYQ,I used to love this mayo and ordered it on shop and save and got it twice a year. The last two shipments have been a disappointment. It now has a strong soybean oil taste.

B005HUWARY,"I have tried at least a dozen different curry powders in the last several weeks and found that the McCormick 1 oz bottle is the very best by far.

B001EPQ18K,"Walkers shortbread thins are a favorite at my house but hard to find. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon even though the price was more than a retail store. But the shipping was free in this case so I bought them. The cookies arrived bundled in a set of 4 boxes as expected. However, every cookie in each box was broken. This does not change the quality taste of these cookies (butter, lemon and raspberry choices) but it definitely limits serving options. I will not likely serve broken cookies at a party or special occasion. I was very disappointed that all the cookies were broken, none were intact. I will be highly hesitant to buy them through Amazon again.",3
B000EM8U1U,"My friend and I were so happy to find this product at Amazon.com. Locally all the stores have stopped carrying it. Not sure why? Shipping from Lipton's site was atrocious so we ordered from Amazon. The tea is exactly what we expected although in the one box that I have opened so far, the tea bags seem to be slightly wrong. When you pull the string topper off the bag, it pulls off the connection between the two sides of the bag. I have not, however, and any tea leakage so this is a small price to pay for the tea that I love so much!!!",4
B000EPP56U,I love these crackers!  Perfect snack for when I need something salty/crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack.  I eat them a lot to hold me over between meals.  The price on amazon is great compared to my local markets.  Highly recommended!,5

They actually do taste like a cheesecake bar should taste which is refreshing.  Many of the low cal foods do not live up to their description. When you purchase something and it says cheesecake you should get the taste that your are expecting which is cheesecake.  Not chemical, not overwhelmingly sweet, but just right.  I found these cheesecake delight bars to be exactly as described. The taste of cheesecake was there and the bar more then adequately fulfills my craving for sweets minus that overwhelming unnatural sweet taste that is present in many low cal bars. If you are a fan of cheesecake but not the very high calorie count associated with cheesecake (which I have been told by those in the know, is one of if not the cake that has the highest caloric count) then this is for you. These bars will definitely be part of my shopping list in the future.",4

B004X3VRLG,"Back from vet.  Vet is about 100% sure it was this chew stick that upset my dog.  His digestive tract is inflammed and will have to be on meds. He is not allowed to eat anything today. My vet said that even one is a lot for my size dog (I brought this to the vet with me), but bag said small dog, one per day (dog weighs 20 pounds). He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one.  The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this.  He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these.  AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.  I believe it is the inside of the chew stick that made him ill, as THAT is what he threw up.  It is distinctive and hard to miss!<br /><br />Particularly if you have a SMALL dog, I would be wary of this chew stick.  I'm not saying it would upset ALL small dogs tummies, just that it is hardly mini and if my vet said it was too big for my 20 pound dog.<br /><br />I have read a lot of dogs love this and did fine with it. Unfortunately mine didn't and it seems SOME other dogs (mostly smaller ones) didn't either.<br /><br />Just trying to save dog owners the worry of seeing their dog in distress and a big vet bill.",1

Alone, left unfiltered, the strength of the espresso can be overwhelming.  For me, this illy issimo caffe drink is a tad too concentrated for my taste.  It has a very strong flavor, which many have praised saying that it is very close to the flavor of an espresso, but for me there is a bitter aftertaste that I can't ignore.  The colder you drink this, the stronger the aftertaste and so I found that letting it get closer to room temperature (slightly cooler, but not much) helped make this a more satisfying `sip'.  Still, I'm not as fond of this particular flavor.  I definitely liked the cappuccino flavor more.",2

Normally, I buy the regular Israeli Couscous from Trader Joe's, but only made it infrequently because I don't like to eat white wheat.  I purchased this and made it the exact way I have always made it.<br />But as soon as I opened up the container, I noticed a really funny smell.  Almost like stale crackers.  I assumed it was because I wasn't used to the Whole Wheat kind, so I went ahead and cooked it.<br />It still had this odd taste and smell.  I don't believe it was because it was Whole Wheat because we only eat Whole Wheat pasta, bread and brown rice.<br />My husband thought it was ""OK"" and was willing to eat more, but I thought it was inedible and returned it.  I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to like it.  If it was a stale batch, its too bad because its too expensive to risk buying another container.<br />The only product I've ever bought from Amazon that I've beeen really disappointed with.

When I first cooked them, there was no fishy smell that I could detect. The only problem I found was the texture. It was like jello and rubber combined.

Flavor-wise it's not bad, though. Maybe it's only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isn't as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something that's supposed to be ""healthy.""<br /><br />Maybe little kids would like it as a treat.

B00113XJQW,I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!,5

B0090X8IPM,"I tend to be a regular coffee drinker - 3 to 4 cups per day. And periodically drink flavored coffee. Most are too flavored for me. I like a dark roast (though not as dark as French Roast). I DO like Starbucks' varietals and SOME blends.<br /><br />So, I was hoping for the best of both worlds when Amazon sent me the 1lb package to try. But it didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />The coffee was a lighter roast than normal - more like Dunkin Donuts. And the Vanilla flavor didn't taste like just vanilla. So I read the package. Though it says ""Vanilla and other Natural Flavors"" on the front of the package the ingredients list reads as follows"" Ground coffee, Natural Flavor (with corn maltodextrine, vegetable Glycerin), Gound Vanilla Beans, Indian Sarsaparilla Root"".  Hmm. corn sugar and a natural vegetable product BEFORE the Vanilla? And Sarsaparilla? It's not in the name. That explained the different taste and the aftertaste I got. How about just giving us coffee and vanilla beans? This is to be premium coffee.<br /><br />I think I'll pass on this line of flavors in the future. Coffee preference is a subjective thing. There are lines at Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks as well as McDonalds. And Maxwell House still sells well.<br /><br />So you may or not agree with me but I just want folks who read this review to know the ingredients when they buy this ""Natural Fusion"" product from Starbucks.<br /><br />Steve Ramm (who generally reviews CDs, books and DVDs but DOES drink coffee too!)<br />""Anything Phonographic""",2

So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.

That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine.

B001P4H57Q,"Thinking I'd be wickedly clever and get a fun treat -- one that's vegan and also contains fiber, hee hee -- into my kids and the rest of the unsuspecting Trick-or-Treaters this year, I ordered a bunch of these bulk boxes of Cracker Jack bags for distribution last Halloween.<br /><br />What a disappointment, in two ways.<br /><br />1. My suspicion is that, unlike the 1970s and 80s when I was a kid and enjoyed these, modern food science has now created a popcorn scanner that sees inside each popped kernel to find out whether it has popped fully or incompletely-- incompletely meaning a hard stone part lurks inside.  If the latter is ascertained, it gets routed onto the Cracker Jack bag-filling line.  I'd say a good half or more of the popped corns in the bags we received contained an unchewable hard part.<br /><br />2. I strongly suspect attorneys seeking to limit settlements by Cracker Jack, Inc. to parents whose children found a way to harm themselves with yesterday's prizes like plastic spinners and ""moving"" pictures have mandated that all Cracker Jack prize designers limit their creations to ""paper only"" models.  They were undoubtedly encouraged to do so by some MBA whiz (most likely a Harvard Business School graduate) who also realized how cheap and lightweight paper is to manufacture, thereby saving on both production and shipping costs, in addition to settlement fees.<br /><br />The unfortunate result is that, unlike the actually fun prizes I remember (a few of which, I am embarrassed to say, I still have packed away somewhere), today's children can look forward to Cracker Jack prizes like paper pencil toppers (two slits and put on the end of that pencil -- wow!) and -- I kid you not -- ""arrange the face of Abe Lincoln"" or ""turn the young face into the elderly Susan B. Anthony"" activities.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I love the Abolitionists and Suffragettes, and Susan B. Anthony, having the honor of being among both camps, is my favorite among them. I will also add that my self-righteous pride expanded as I realized I was distributing to neighborhood children lessons about American historical figures along with a vegan, fiber-containing snack, all masquerading as a Halloween treat.<br /><br />But the Cracker Jacks that children love are gone.  Mine, who are in 1st and 4th grade, won't even eat the leftover bags, and so I started eating them myself-- except I couldn't force myself to chew through all those hard kernels. And when I tossed my kids the prizes, they said, ""no, thanks.""<br /><br />I write this not to deride a classic treat but to beseech the powers-that-be at Cracker Jack to restore their product to the quality of its glory days, when hard kernels weren't plentiful and the prizes were worth finishing your bag or box for.  Arise, Crack Jack, to this challenge, and reclaim your rightful place in American childhood!",1

However, I still had some heartburn with this coffee, despite the fact that I'm also on Nexium.<br /><br />Everyone is different when it comes to toleration of acid, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying this coffee.

B003GTR8IO,"I don't know what the odd taste is. It smells lightly of vanilla, and I've never brewed Starbucks at home before, so maybe all their coffee tastes this way, but there is an acrid, almost chemical aftertaste to each mouthful of this. I smell a decent basic medium roast, but I taste burning and something very off. The vanilla is weak, but strong enough to ruin the cup.<br /><br />I got this from the Vines program, and I'd never buy it again. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn't worth the brewing, even if it was free. I've had better results from grocery-store brands that were pre-ground and on the shelf for who knows how long.",2

I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them.",4

B002LANN56,"Tested on RUGER, 11 year old male neutered beagle type dog, 17 inches high and 25 pounds. Moderate activity level.<br />Slightly crazy, very lovable, goofy disposition, quite the momma's boy.<br /><br />Over a week I offered this food to my dog along side a bowl of his regular diet. His regular diet is Purina D/H mixed Loyall Lamb and Rice kibble.<br />He is a pretty predictable dog, and every day he chose to eat his D/H chunks out first, then a few kibbles of the Loyall, than he would eat a few bites of the Chef Michaels.<br />So, he did like it, and he did eat it.<br />There were a few things that drew my attention.<br />1. No where on the bag does it say where the ingredients are sourced. Is he eating American beef? Mexico?<br />Now, it doesn't say where his food is sourced on his D/H (Purina Dental Health) BUT, he loves that food SO MUCH and it keeps his teeth so nice I do continue to feed it to him. After all, I can't source where all the ingredients I EAT come from, so why should my dog eat better than I do? So, it isn't a major issue, but for those who really want to know, well, you will have to contact Purina.<br />2. The food felt FLUFFY and a bit greasy, and the red dyed beefy bits drifted with handling to the top. So, you have to shake before serving to get the kibbles to mix in a more uniform way before feeding. Otherwise, your dog gets a bowl of soft beefy bits and no kibble.<br />3. The kibble pieces did not seem crunchy enough to prevent tartar build up. Hummm. Perhaps after a long feeding diet of this your pet will NEED Purina D/H. I may be on to something here. I doubt this diet will do anything for dental health for your dog.<br />4. Why add artificial colors? Really? He doesn't even look at the food. At 11 years old, His sight may be questionable anyway and as a BEAGLE he doesn't look in the bowl before eating. He sniffs everything. To my dog, smell is everything. And for most dogs, I've never seen them eye each piece of kibble before chowing down. I seriously doubt dogs care if the potato bits are brown, the green bean kibbles are green, or the meat is red. Actually, after cooking, it should be brown as well. The colors can be left out, they are unnecessary. BUT, then again, as a kid who grew up on Kool-Aid, Mom enjoyed mixing up all those great colorful drinks for us, and we grew up fine (twitch twitch) but I state again, no sense in my dog eating better than me. (Now I want some red fruity punch just writing this)<br />5. Serving size is WAY too much. Each cup of this food has 270 calories. THAT IS A LOT! 28% protein and 16% fat. That is a bit more protein and fat than my guy is used to, so, it may be a bit ""rich"" for some dogs. ALSO, take notice, not all that protein is from those dried beefy looking chewy chunks. There are other sources of proteins in here, from Chicken by product meal, corn gluten, and soy. These are all sources of protein, but it may seem misleading if you think the protein is all from beef (which is, by the way, the number one ingredient)<br />6. The fat is ""animal fat"" so your guess is as good as mine. Emu? Llama? Pig? Sheep? Deer? Bison? Snake? Who knows, they should just label it ""mystery fat"" and I hope soylent green is not some of the green bits.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like I am knocking the food, and I really am not. It is DOG FOOD. My dog goes outside and eats rabbit poo, so I feel this bag of food is at least more nutritionally complete than rabbit poo.<br />And again, some of our human foods aren't much better, so I don't feel guilty feeding this to my dog while I enjoy a cool glass of Kool-Aid and chow down on some McDonald's Fries-- OCCASIONALLY.<br />In a perfect world, we would all eat nuts and berries, and fresh protein sources. If you want to feed your dog dog food you are pretty limited on types and styles. This is the junk food style dog food. I would give it occasionally as a treat (as I also do everything in moderation, I am not eating fries and KoolAid daily)<br />But I don't think I could feed this in good conscience to my dog daily, unless I added some FRESH raw meat and some pureed veggies, and probably I'd have to add something crunchy for dental health.<br /><br />This diet would probably be good for dog with rotten teeth already who find it too painful to eat regular foods and whose owners would rather put them on this instead of looking into their mouth problem.<br />Also, it would be good for picky eaters, whose owners would rather feed them this than find out why their dog's appetite is lacking.<br />This diet would also be good for training, you can take the bits out and use them as training treats. But take a rag, they leave a residue on your hands.",3

B000F3Q8XU,"I have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was VERY happy to see the Wisecrackers available on Amazon at about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery)! Cannot beat that! Aside from the price, why do I buy Wisecrackers:<br /><br />1) TEXTURE and CRUNCH: They are much tougher then regular crackers. They hold MUCH better when you need them for a dip, or a base for a topping. They allow you to ""feel"" the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping.<br /><br />2) TASTE: They taste almost like bread crust, with ONLY 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers (each is about two inches by two inches).<br /><br />REGARDING THE FLAVOUR: I like the sesame variety the most, for their neutral aftertaste. The Pepper variety is not as versitile; in fact, it is quite spicy. You will have to choose the dips and the toppings carefully. However, they can be eaten alone as well, as a light in-between-meal snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!",4

It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.

However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.

So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans).

B007RTR8AM,"Disclaimer- my hair is keratin treated and may not be representative.<br /><br />First, I recognize that the shampoo and conditioner claim to make stronger hair in 7 days and that I didn't use it for that time.  But I don't feel that the immediate downsides of this product make trying for a long term benefit a good idea.<br /><br />The bottle arrived open and most of the product was spilled into the bag.  Because it has a pop top it will spill very easily.<br /><br />My hair is fine and quite long (well past the bra line). It is also keratin treated.  Like most people with long hair I care a great deal about it and put quite a bit of effort into it's care.  I was excited to try this product.<br /><br />It lathered up very nicely and smelled good.  My first hint of trouble was that as it rinsed out, my hair was feeling very stripped and was tangling.<br /><br />While this product is meant to be used over time to gain results one of the biggest things to avoid with long hair is dry tangly hair.  It causes immediate damage.",1
B00170NWEI,"What a difference this tea is from bagged teas, even the organic bags!  As mentioned by other reviewers, it is very GREEN.  The leaves, the tea... GREEN!  I wasn't expecting the natural sweetness to it, it's almost weird and grassy to me.  This probably means it's better and I just need to get used to it.  Heed the warnings to not steep too long - the bitterness makes it quite awful.  I was, however, able to save that first pot by diluting it and drinking it iced after adding sweetener and lemon.",4
B005O072PC,"For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!",1

I am really happy with my purchase.  The taste of the Sorrento is what I would expect of a Medium Roast = A good, smooth blend.  No bitter, acidic after taste, and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup!  (At least, it left me)! :p  It's doesn't leave you with the ""shhhakes"" either, it has that right ""balance"" you need with your daily cup of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, I will be getting another 24-Count of this when I am finished with this pack!<br /><br />5-Stars!",5

Ive bought small boxes before, but these are smaller. I would say that its as small as my Ipad2. Only about two bowls per box. Put it in perspective a can of soda is 12oz, this box is 17oz. Really small!<br />I thought that it was a comparable deal to the supermarket (they were expensive at the market when available) but when you take in the size its a bit silly.<br />I was ready to order 20 boxes but via prudence waited to receive one order first.

B001E5E3IA,"I'm a user of liquid stevia and i was looking for something i could use for baking.  The sweetener never dissolves with the wet ingredients, and, when your baking cools off, you have crunchy crystals of this sweetener in your baking. I even tried dissolving it first by warming up the wet ingredients, it appeared to dissolve, but after cooling i got the same results.  The other reviewers say that you tune into the taste in order to taste it.  I agree, if you use too little, it does not sweeten (you can't taste it), and if you use enough to taste it, you've ruined what you are trying to sweeten with it's nasty tin foil taste.  Dont bother using it for coffee or tea, because it sinks to the bottom of the cup because it does not completely dissolve even in hot water.  I should also mention that its not sweet in the slightest bit.  And i've been off sugar for years, so it's not because i'm used to real sugar.<br /><br />Bleh.",1

The drink is tasty, and I prefer the carbonation over a straight juice product. I feel the carbonation imparts a slightly bitter finish, but that it adds to the drinkability of what is essentially a sweet but unimposing fruit flavor. So while there is nothing particularly wrong with the drink, I can't really get enthusiastic about it and I think there are better, tastier, and more economical selections available. It's a great change of pace but is not a threat to become a regular in my drink routine.",4

So far I've had the orange and the cola...not enjoyable at all.  I had realistic expectations and did not expect it to taste like the ""regular"" sugar or even ""diet"" versions that are popular.  But, I had hoped they would at least be good.  My teens and I dislike the taste completely.  There is also a very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time.  Ugh.  I'm going to stick to my carbonated water with a slice of lemon from now on. **Have tried all the flavors and still do not like this product.  I have had other products with Stevia that are acceptable, the aftertaste on this one is horrible.",2
B000G6RYNE,"I love these chips, which is why I bought them, to stock up for the entire school year. The chips taste great, and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived. The box on the other hand was in tatters, with holes and complely squished...

All the chips are as they should be.",4
B0081XIAOQ,"This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it.",2
B0030VBRIU,This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed. And it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to Happy Baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.,1
B004SRH2B6,I had heard a lot about coconut water and thought I would give this a try.  I wish I had tried a bottle locally rather than buying multiple bottles through Amazon.

B003VTN95K,"Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.",5
B001LQNX8S,"These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One-One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand-up box dispenser which is nice too.  I can't understand the other reviewer here who didn't like the coffee - I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod I've found.  Also the value here can't be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you won't be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto-delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum.",5

Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste.

I was only able to get down half a glass of this.  If you are pregnant and looking for something to ease your morning sickness, try ginger tea instead.

B0027UQYZQ,I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.,4

B0041NYV8E,"Years ago, a friend from India suggested that I mix ginger juice with honey and turmeric and give it to my little girl as a cough remedy.  I found that it worked great, my daughter liked the taste better than cough syrup, and I thought it tasted fantastic.  I thought this drink mix might taste kind of like that, and it does, if you taste the mix straight out of the pouch.  But when I put it in water, I used more water than recommended (after seeing a lot of comments saying that the mix was too strong), and that was a huge mistake.  If anything, it would be best in LESS water than recommended.  It's very tasty, but drinking 8 ounces of prepared drink would just be too much volume for this kind of drink.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this drink mix unless you know that you like strong ginger beverages, because the ginger flavor is very strong and spicy.  It would be great to drink (in small quantities) when you have a cold or have a sore throat.  I wish it was a little sweeter (I ended up adding more sweetener and some lemon juice).<br /><br />A small point: you should be aware that the pouches are very difficult to open because there is no ""starter"" perforation.  I needed scissors.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad drink.  Just be aware of what you're getting, and start with maybe half a cup of water, then add more if you find that you would prefer something weaker.",3

B004CLCEDE,"Great idea - no calories, no fat, etc. They are slimey and chewing them is what I'd guess chewing worms would be like. They are firm enough to have more texture than pasta, but still gel like. I just put them with spaghetti sauce, but maybe there's a better option. Have not found it yet. I've read more about them and what nutritional benefits they may have so it makes it worth the try. Cost is certainly reasonable enough. Give them a try and maybe you'll have a better idea.",2
B0048IC328,"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!",2

B0019J4PJ8,"I found this brand on Petsmart's website as an online only special. The price was excellent (~$1 per lb). The list of ingredients and quality seemed good and my dog liked it so I was happy. Then I went to order it again and have found that their prices have sky rocketed! Now they are in the same glut as all the other ""designer"" dog foods that have ridiculous price tags. Didn't you hear?...people are getting rid of their pets because they can't afford to feed them and this company is of no help. Unbelievable! Well, By Nature, you lost my business. If your dog food is the same high price and quality as 10 million others, there is absolutely no reason to buy it. Didn't your marketing people tell you that? or did they just take your money? Lucky for my dog, I found another well-known, high quality dog food that I will purchase instead.",1

B000KV61FC,"My Beagle, who is an avid chewer, really enjoys the tug-a-jug.  It took her about a day to figure out the fastest way to get to the treats, but even so it still takes her some time to work everything out of it.  It's better than other treat-dispensing toys I have which make the treats either too easy or too difficult to get out.  The only reason I wouldn't give this toy 5 stars is that my dog was able to chew right through the attached rope within the first hour of playing with it, so that part of it was not too durable.  Still, even without the rope it's a good product.",4
B001EO5TUW,"Look elsewhere for a better DEAL on Amazon by buying bulk than this ripoff OVERPRICED item.<br />Besides, these contain stems/partial stems, which not only cheapens the price but wounds up uneven done-ness.

B002OFUBJO,"The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.",2

Or maybe like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUZYWQ"">Sensible Portions Veggie Straws Original Sea Salt, 20 Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. These chips taste like odd corn chips. They are very bland, and have only a *hint* of the carrot taste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, they aren't so bad that they are inedible. They just were NOT what I expected.<br /><br />Also, they are greasier than I would prefer.<br /><br />If you're looking for good tasting chips that taste like carrots, I would not recommend these. If you are looking for corn chips that kind of taste like carrots, then maybe these are for you.<br /><br />I still have like 4 bags of these unopened because nobody in my house wants to eat them :-(",2

B006G7XV7A,"This is marketed as ""thin style"", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars.",3
B005W9TIIO,"It is simple really, these peanuts have precious little spice on them.  They are not dry roasted and the spice is missing in action.  I had to add my own spices to them to make them palatable.  If it says Hot&Spicy then they need to deliver the goods.  Not this time.",2

B000E7WM0K,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.<br /><br />Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.<br /><br />The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess.",1

We cannot say enough good things about them!",5
B002NHYQAS,"So, I don't really know how to express my feelings over a chocolate bar.  In my household, there is no other choice besides dark chocolate--that's all we do.  Whether it's the conventional Special Dark or the ritzy high end selections, we've tried it all.  I was excited to check out Newman's Own, an organic variation weighing in at 54% cocoa.  When we go upscale, we tend to venture into the 72% range, so I was interested to see the difference.<br /><br />Me:  I liked the bar.  It was appropriately sweet (but perhaps not dark enough) and had a smoothness I enjoyed.  Spouse:  Didn't like it as much as I did.  Not enough cocoa content, rather generic in conception.  Value:  While we split over quality, we agreed that the price tag on this chocolate was probably a bit high.  We've had better alternatives for less--in some cases a lot less!  Obviously, no one is going to hate a chocolate bar--I'd just recommend that you sample one before investing in a large quantity.  Make sure it delivers the bang you require for your buck!<br /><br />3 Stars from my spouse, 4 stars from me--product at 3 1/2 stars.  But since I write the review, I get the round-up!",4

Five cans were damaged, including one that was busted open. The company sent us a new case, but didn't listen to us about packaging the formula. This time they used two sheets of packing paper.... one can was dented but nothing was punctured this time. I will say for the price you can't pass it, but be warned about having cans being damaged.

B001E5E29A,I am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world.  I like to make my own or get them at the Original Pancake House (which has the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted).  I decided to try this box mix variation even though I am not a fan of box mixes.  The Stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that's where I ceased to be impressed.  These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess I'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  They're ok but not worth all that money.,3

I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.",1

B001X7RGCY,I would not purchase this item again.  It has some sort of scent or perfume added which is not only very noticeable but unappetizing. No listing of any additive of that sort on the package except aromatic spices and I doubt there is anything in nature that smells like that. Packages are marked 'Product of China'.  I have had no problem with Lee Kum Kee sauces that I purchased in the past.,1

Does take some extra mixing, but ice tea it is.  I was somewhat disappointed in the flavor however.  There was a tea undertone, but the basic taste was honey, which also overwhelmed the mango & pineapple, which was negligible.  I drank it all over 1/2 hour.  Iced tea more or less it is, but the honey flavor is king.  Of course, it is not ""sticky"" like real honey.<br /><br />I don't know.  I prefer others to this.

B004ZIER34,"The taste of this brew is somewhere in between low end Folgers and a high end gourmet brew with great flavor.  It's not as bad as cheap, commercial coffee but still has a slight hint of that 7-11/gas station/Folgers like taste.  I noticed a difference in the acid level, it tastes almost lighter, or cleaner which is a big bonus, especially for people with stomach issues (and everyone eating a western diet tends to have high acidity).  But I would not purchase this product again due to the taste.  It wasn't ""high end"" tasting enough for me, however I am used to drinking organic gourmet coffee.  If you drink commercial, cheaper coffee I think you would be satisfied with this taste and pleased with the low acid element.",3
B000FFIL9C,Bought this as a gift for someone who really enjoys tea. She loved the gift- and said that the teas provided tasted very good.

B0085G4ACA,I love buying these and drinking them after my workout.  You lose not just fluids but minerals/vitamins and this helps replenish you.  Water is good too for you too but I just love these post-workout.

B002DHL6II,"I tried this as an alternative to Kashi's Honey Almond Flax (Chewy Granola) bars, which I love almost as much as the Roasted Almond Crunch (Crunchy Granola) bars. It's possible I'd like the Tail Mix bars when I'm in the middle of a long, strenuous hike, but it could be months before I test that hypothesis. Simply put, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and these are overly sweet for me as a mid-afternoon snack at the office.<br /><br />However, after trying this and that without much satisfaction, I've found a solution that will help me get through all these bars rather than having to ship them back. I bought some Uncrystallized Candied Ginger at Trader Joe's, and the heat of the ginger--plus a few almonds--is a perfect foil.

There are many grain-free brands out there that cost about the same with NO by-products like Royal Canin, Science Diet or Purina.

B003VXFK44,"Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't.

The cover of the box lists it as wheat-free, gluten-free, non-dairy, with 180 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, and no trans fat.  In small print on the side we also find that this company donates to celiac sprue and autism organizations.<br /><br />And it is indeed, as the box also claims, ""moist and chewy.""  The major downer about the product is merely its consistency, as it comes out of its packet as some kind of misshapen, ill-defined lump rather than a literal ""bar,"" and as such it doesn't hold together very well, but that's nitpicking.

Better labeling with a dairy or milk content warning would be a plus, or if in the description it listed not only the types of ""soups"" in this variety pack, but also the ingredients.

B0052UOQQM,"I'm disappointed in Weruva. My cats like this food, but the package marketing states Love Me Tender is ""Chicken and Duck"" in gravy. It should also state tuna is a main ingredient. I'm taking two stars off because of the mislead. My cats like this stuff - they don't get much fish in their diet which explains why they lost their minds slopping this up.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS OF LOVE ME TENDER: Water Sufficient For Processing, Chicken, Tuna, Duck, Tapioca Starch, Sunflower Seed Oil, Tricalcium Phosphate, Xanthan Gum, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Nicotinic Acid (Vitamin B3), Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Supplement, Potassium Iodide, Manganese Sulfate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Copper Sulfate, Riboflavin Supplement (Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Folic Acid, Vitamin B12 Supplement<br /><br />GENERAL INFO ON CATS IN THE KITCHEN: Weruva Cats In the Kitchen Love Me Tender Pouches are made with natural ingredients like Chicken & Duck in a gravy sauce. This formula is completely grain-free and does not contain Vitamin K. These easy open pouches are a great alternative to cans but provides the same nutritional value! Weruva's Pouches (like their cans) are great for cats who are prone to UTI's and Kidney issues because of the amount of water that they add to your cats daily diet. Your cats will love this great tasting formula!",3

B005EF0HSG,"As I said in a recent review for the larger Celebrate with a Crowd offering from ig4U, you start with a deep and attractive basket, then fill it (above a buffer) with a variety of tasty and unusual treats ranging from hard pretzels, to delicate truffles, imported sandwich cookies, unusual grain mustard, and number of other welcome surprises, and you have this well-stocked gift basket.  ""Celebrate with a Friends"" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.<br /><br />The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation/organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich brown ribbon with a card -- all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.<br /><br />I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience -- indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1-star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov/early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of browsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective.",4
B00141QYSQ,"For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.",4
B000GZEWEE,Some of the Torani syrups are great but this one is actually kind of bland.,2
B001EQ5EJQ,"La Tourangelle Roasted Walnut is the best tasting oil I have ever had. My old favorite was Avocado oil but this is even better and keeps longer. I pour it on everything. Make a great mayonnaise. Spinkle on baked stuffed shrimp or baked fish. Drizzled on steak or chicken and as a topping for pasta and bruschetta with some garlic, parsley and parmesan cheese. Addictive so you'll want to have it in the house all the time. Buy it you will love it.",5
B0013NUGDE,Excellent health conscious snack food with only 100 calories per serving.  This is a new flavor and will appeal to some.  It is not one of my favorites but interesting for a change of pace.,4
B002RTNBSA,"This is made in Thailand and does not taste the same. The old made in Japan drinks are totally superior in taste, after taste, aroma. Didn't listen to the other reviewer about the formula change with the made in Thailand drinks and ordered 2 cases but didn't want to go through the trouble of returning. If you had tasted the old drink, you will greatly be disappointed. If you have not had Ito En before, you may still find this drink good. Sorry, not for me.<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted ""watered down"", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly.",2
B000K7644E,After reading the reviews on the salt I decided I wanted to make Kalaua pork for my husband to remind him of the 5 years we lived on Oahau.

B000FBM4FI,"I enjoy my Kavli Crispy Thins so much and so often that I now order by the case. Besides being naturally low fat and naturally nutritious, Kavli Crisp Thins are a great replacement for salty, fattening nachoes, and/ or pizza. With Crispy Thins, you can make your own nachos by layering the Crisps w/ chopped tomatoes, cheese, even ground meat ... pop 2 Crisp Thins w/ toppings in microwave, and  you've got your delicious nachos, (or pizza). I have Crispy Thins w/ melted cheese every morning ... great way to start the day. No, I don't work for Kavli ! This is not an ad, but a truthful review. Also so nice and easy to be able to order Kavli ( and just about everything) via Amazon.",5
B005K4Q1VI,My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again,2
B000H9K4KA,As far as licorice goes this one is just so so. If you love real licorice buy RJ's that in my opinion is by far the best there is. This one has great texture and a good initial taste but then a strange bitter note like that of blackstrap molasses hits your tongue and a an unpleasant sulpfur after taste that lingers. It is too sweet and almost more of an anise flavor then real pure licorice. I don't know whats in it it came in a clear bag twist tied from a health food store locally. If you love blackstrap you may like it. I much prefer RJ's it is all natural and much better in both texture and pure real licorice root flavor. I like Panda brand for flavor too but not texture. I would not buy Kookaburra brand again.,2
B002IEZJMA,I just don't really see the market for these things at this price.  This is bad cold iced coffee with a somewhat synthetic chemical like taste.  Provides caffeine if that's what you are looking for but the taste is somewhat horrible.,2

B0057QMXRK,"My fiance' loves fortune cookies so I figured this would be a great creative way to pop the question. Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams weren't completely shut. I could see the word ""Will"" through the backside of the cookie.<br /><br />Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.<br /><br />And last but not least, the price. For the quality you're getting, I'd be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted. They are way overpriced for what you're getting.<br /><br />Buy only out of desperation.",3
B006H34CUS,"If you like banana bread, then you will love this bar! It's pretty soft and chewy, with lots of flavoring. It is a little too sweet for my liking (but then again I am not a big fan of banana nut anything in general). The nuts don't overpower the bar taste, which is good! The price is a little high but I do think you get what you pay for - especially since it is a very healthy product.",3

They eventually got bored of the Fromm Surf & Turf but for the first month loved to eat it. Yes, it's more expensive than the other dry foods but the ingredients used helped my prevent break-outs that one of my dogs were experiencing from allergies. I switched them to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness and it has higher protein and Omega fatty acids. The dogs enjoyed the change in food but it gave them both gas and one of them had diarrhea. I like the ingredients of the Blue Buffalo but according to my vet some owners are complaining about the same effects on their dogs because it's very rich. I'm remaining with the Fromm simply because of the quality and it's grain less so it helps my dog with allergies.",4
B000FIXT2I,The white and brown rice is much better.  This rice is nothing like I expected... cannot eat without masking the flavor.,2
B000EQYW0E,"I have noooo idea what the ""blech"" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months.",3

B0038RLIYO,I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again.,2

B002IEZJMA,"I enjoy trying new drinks, and I also like coffee and espresso drinks.  So I was curious about the Caffe coffee drink from Illy Issimo.  However, I was a little disappointed in the result.  The taste started sweet, transitioned to citrus, and finished bitter.  I found that the added sugar masked any potential nuance from the coffee without providing any real desirable flavor of its own.  While not necessarily bad, the Caffe (6.8 oz, 50 calories, 155 mg caffeine) does not compare favorably with a tall Starbucks Iced Coffee (12 oz, 60 calories, 120 mg caffeine).  If you are looking for a compact shot of caffeine, this might be what you want.  However, don't expect much in the taste department.  I am hoping that the Cappuccino fares better.",2

This drink is somewhat complex if you can taste beyond the huge ginger impact of it. First there is a sweet honey-ish warmth, followed by an almost immediate rush of ginger. Next is a pepper-y taste and feel as and after it goes down. The pepper stays on the front of the mouth and the back of the throat for quite a while. Very little lemon. There is enough sweetness to be able to stand up to a healthy squeeze from a lemon wedge. Adding more water made it less intense, but was still a bit too sweet.

It does taste good and stays crunchy in milk, it was sweet but not sicken so,  but I get enough sugar in other products that I do not want this much in my cereal.

However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil).<br /><br />The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him and we were not disappointed with this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis). I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that while the cats seem to like the product as much as any other soft food, they don't seem to like it that much more to balance the extra cost.",4

B001BDDTB2,"This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is ""People food for cats"" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars.",4
B001O88NG0,"Used it for two months now.  Not sure it's helped at all.  My dog still thinks she's starving.  I had already cut her back, then cut her back more on recommendation from the product directions.  She loves the taste, but if she's lost even 2 pounds I'd be surprised.  Worse, though, is that it doesn't seem to stave off her hunger at all (that IS a tall order though, as she is one of those dogs who would eat until she explodes....).",3

Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.<br /><br />On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too.",2

I was raised on 'scratch' cooking,might be a personal issue.<br /><br />Reporting back: I used a new pair of scissors and cut noodles up in 1/2 inch pieces. The solution is to swallow the bits w/o chewing. I couldn't throw product on compost heap as I believe the MIRACLE noodle would not break down.<br /><br /> The Miracle in the product name is-if you can get them down without the noodles wrapping around your tonsils,it's a miracle.

B0052OI128,"I really liked these cookies when they first came out.  But then I got a little tired of them.  They have a bit of a gritty texture, and they don't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but I can't eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesn't agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils, just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and I don't like it at all.  Some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well, but I'm guessing it is less because they don't bother me.  I like them much better.  It's weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu, the vanilla wins for me.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos don't taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesn't seem to be very different.  Actually, the difference in sodium doesn't seem very significant, either.  I decided I'd rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.  It's something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons.",3

Well these are high in protein(which I like), are low in fat(which I like), but I think in their processing to make it low-fat they compromised on the flavor. I was expecting a more natural peanut butter taste but was disappointed with the texture and taste. Artificial!!  I will not buy these again.  I'm stuck now with the whole box. My hunt continues for that great snack bar.",2

B00622CYVS,"Don't let the ""Earth's Best"" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, ""My kids will only eat Earth's Best!"" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.<br /><br />Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has ""applesauce"" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened.<br /><br />Shame on Earth's Best as a company.

They placed the whole cookie on top of a graham cracker and said it tasted great that way!<br /><br />I'm all for stories, and I liked how they attempt to tell their story on the box--that Mallomars have been enjoyed in New York City for decades, and its most loyal fans reside there.

B001EQ4E60,"Nestea instant sugar-free with lemon is something I tried recently at a friends place who is not a coffee drinker and is dieting.<br /><br />It's not delicious and refreshing as it looks. The addition of Aspartame gives it that distinct aspartame taste. The after taste is also unsavory.Putting in fresh lemon juice was the only way I could drink it.<br /><br />I don't consume very much sugar, still I thought I'd try it. I would prefer to have no sugar at all than have aspartame in it.<br /><br />Occasionally I drink regular tea with lemon, but no sugar.<br />This is just my personal opinion, but when I'd read up on Aspartame being a possible carcinogenic, I never used it again until recently.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it's healthier to diabetics who want a somewhat sweet taste, but for myself, I don't like chemicals, only natural drinks and flavors.",4

This place ripped me off by charging $17 bucks for strips instead of a full ear.  Additionally, the strips had the hair still attached.

B002NHYQAS,"Unlike the other members of my family, I'm not a chocoholic.  I'm a take it or leave it consumer and in general, I go for the good stuff.  This sample bar was my introduction to the Newman's Own Organic Chocolate line, and in order to get a variety of opinions, I shared this taste with several co-workers.<br /><br />My immediate impression was that the bar had the nice, crisp snap of well-tempered chocolate, and also that it had a lovely texture, melting quickly and smoothly in my mouth.  The ""dark"" chocolate bar has a slightly smoky flavor, but only 54% cocoa, which is less than what many may be looking for in a dark bar.  (Newman's Own also has a super dark bar with 70% cocoa.)  All of us felt that this bar was sweeter than we would have ideally preferred, more akin to bittersweet chocolate than a true dark chocolate.  It was suggested, for that reason, that it might be a nice high-quality bar for baking--though as noted previously, it is not a standard baking bar size.<br /><br />The other thing that all of us noticed was a very subtle orange note to the flavor, to the point that we searched the ingredients for an explanation.  The ingredients of this organic bar are very simple and straightforward.  In fact, there are only five, none of which would explain this undertone.  And it wasn't a problem, overt, or unpleasant; it was simply commented upon.  Further perusing the Newman's Own offerings, I see they produce a dark chocolate orange bar, and I have to suppose there is some minor cross ""contamination"" of the flavors.  Mystery solved.<br /><br />A quick survey among my cohort revealed that there was only one of us who really cared that the product was organic.  Yeah, the rest of us are Philistines.  Based on the high price point and the low percentage of cocoa, even though we'd enjoyed the treat, none of us was inclined to purchase the product again.  Your mileage may vary.",3

B001EQ55RW,"My spouse bought these and put them in the pantry.  In cocoa-inspired weakness, I opened the canister, seeking roasted almonds, cocoa, and happiness.  Over the dominant almond and cocoa, it became apparent to me that there was ""Something Else"" in the can.  No ""artificially sweetened"" warning.  No ""Contains splenda!"" flag.  Irresponsible, in my opinion.  I detest the aftertaste of splenda, not mentioned alongside ""Emerald Roast Almonds Dark Chocolate flavor"" until you read the itty-bitty ingredients text.  Strong black coffee and a slowly nursed-along glass of porter ale over the next few hours finally washed my mouth clean enough to take my mind off of the experience.  When I see an Emerald nut package, it still reminds me of that nasty surprise.<br /><br />The canister went into the trash and I complained to Emerald.  They haven't acknowledged my complaint, and they continue to market artificially sweetened nuts without clearly labeling them as such.  Splenda producers appear to be intent on avoiding the ""artificial"" label, but that is clearly a misrepresentation on their part.  I now check ingredient lists very carefully.

Second, I trust Earth's Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife's tale. Are you people saying that you don't give your babies fruit and vegetables?

B001EQ5EJQ,"I make an extended butter using this oil, water and liquid lecithin.  It is just the BEST tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil.  I keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma.  It tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency. I didn't know to do this on the  first container and when I got to the bottom it was very thick, almost sludgy, with the roasted bits.  Amazon's price is pretty fair although I can occasionally find it locally (TJ Maxx)a bit cheaper. But I must say ordering from Amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is VERY convenient.  I've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product (well maybe a small dent in the metal but that's all).",5
B000WEOSKC,"So I had a big problem this season with rabbits eating my Hostas,lilies and other plants. It was getting so bad, that I figured I'd spend the money and try one of these sprays knowing that the reviews for pretty much all of them seem to be split.  I figured I had nothing to lose.  So I applied as per the labels instructions.  I did not have any issue with the spray damaging any of my flowers or plants and it did seem to work initially.  I had almost a week with no new damage. There was also no rain of any note that may have washed it away.  I don't think the rain since has washed it away either though, as I can see a residue on some of the leaves on some plants that were sprayed and left high up in a place where rabbits couldn't get to them.  Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived. Again I was coming home to check on my plants and finding more bitten off leaves and decapitated lilies. I stopped checking before leaving for work because it would put me in such a bad mood every time I'd see more ""victims"".<br /> I just hate spending almost $20.00 for something (I was so desperate that I paid the extra 3.99 for 1 day even though I am a prime member) that in the end did not work as it should have. I just planted replacement bulbs for the 22 of 25 lilies that were beheaded and now I am here looking for a different kind of rabbit/small animal repellent. It's difficult to choose, as again it seems many products work for some and not for others. It looks like I was just one of the unlucky ones with this product and I'll try something else and see what happens.  Good luck to you all.  I hope you have more success than I did whether you try this product or a different one.",2

Unfortunately, it loses flavor and the potent aroma the minute you open the bag. It also sours quickly if you leave it on the heat for more than a few minutes. This is not a flavor I can drink daily, but that is unfortunate because the flavor doesn't last long enough in the bag to use it within a week either(pot a day). So in the end, I'd rather just buy this flavor as a fresh cup down the street at the local shop once in a while. As a daily drinker, my palate is in-tune with the Melitta's Enchanted Evening.",4
B000V1D19A,"I have modified the instructions to adjust it to the kind of Asian curry that I am used to.  Instead of adding 1 cup of water, I have added one cup of coconut milk with one cup of water - or you can use normal reduced or whole milk. It adds flavor and dilute the salty taste.  On top of that, I added some spice chillie (sambal chilie available at most Asian grocery).  It adds spice to the otherwise bland, salty curry.<br /><br />The paste is much faster short cut to making authentic curry. It's easily done.  You can use the paste for other spicy dishes and not restricted to just curry.  eg. curry fried noodles, or use it to season chicken wings for bbq etc ... at amazon subscription price, it's a great deal.",4

B005UP1M4I,"I tried these on my Pixie machine, and since the capsules are not really made for it but older machines, they don't work well for newer models. The retrofit ring the capsules come with are a cheap band aid. I tried around 20 capsules before giving up. Most of the time there was excessive water flowing into the reservoir due to said incompatibility with the newer machines like my Pixie. I cannot speak for the older models.<br />There is also an environmental issue:<br />Once used, the ne caps are done and go into the garbage -  cutting the lid and using the grind for mulch is a good idea. However reusing them seems pointless and it is harder to separate the plastic from the aluminum left over lid than with the Nespresso type which is all aluminum.<br /><br />The better and much cheaper option: REUSE THE ORIGINAL NESPRESSO CAPSULES<br />I cut open and empty the regular Nespresso capsules to use the grind for mulch, then after washing and drying refill them at least once for another round with my favorite Espresso, crema type. The lid is a simple aluminum foil cut from standard foil roll (you can make multiple lids at the same time by layering foil pieces then cutting the circular lids with a scissor all at once. Make sure the circle is not too big, it should not extend too far up the capsule cone but stay neatly wrapped around the lip. Otherwise it can be leaky). Here a good link<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This means every so often you have to buy new capsules, but refilling them probably cuts the cost per capsule by 50% min. if used 2-3 times.",1

I have tried other beverages that were supposed to be cheaper versions of it, only to be disappointed every time.  I thought, with this version (Dr Zevia) being so much more expensive and using stevia to sweeten as a healthier alternative than sugar, that this would likely be closer to the brand name beverage it was trying to be like.  Unfortunately, I found it not only wasn't closer to the flavor, it was much worse than any I had tried in the past!  It was like drinking carbonated cough syrup!  I did not return it because my son decided to drink it and suffer through it to try to reduce his caloric intake, but if he wants more of it, he will have to buy it himself.

In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.

B0007IQQXA,"I love French vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this. It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.<br /><br />In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product. I actually like light roasts but this is the first time I've had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was.",1
B008O3G25W,"These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the ""lick but don't bite"" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors. The dogs didn't distinguish among them so unless you have a finicky pet, choice of flavor may not matter.",3

B003VIN0QE,"I've had some of the other Pacific Natural brand products, and enjoyed them.  This one however, I just didn't care for.  It wasn't as good as some of their other chowders, and even though it was a lot of food, it wasn't satisfying.<br /><br />Since the flavor was potato rosemary I expected those to be the predominant flavors.  And they were to an extent, especially the rosemary.  There definitely was that piney flavor that permeated the soup.  The potatoes took a back seat though and while they represented most of the texture, they didn't really have that potato-like taste.  I also thought it was somewhat watery and nothing like the texture of a chowder at all.  There were other vegetables included, but you really couldn't taste them.  Another note on the texture, I encountered some rosemary sprigs that were tough to chew.  It didn't bother me, but I know it bothers a lot of people.<br /><br />The ingredients were pretty good.  Only a few things are in this including water, potatoes, cream, onion, celery, carrot, cornstarch, sea salt, garlic, rosemary, and natural flavor.  So really, not that much at all.  Which is good, I hate when they add fillers and at least with sea salt it's a healthier salt than normal.  Calorie wise its about 230 per serving, and there are two servings in the box.  I of course ate both servings since I had nowhere to store the rest at work, but even so it made up a pretty large portion that I almost couldn't finish.  It just wasn't satisfying as said before.  Fat is 8 grams per serving and sodium 730 mg per serving.  There are some vitamins, but I don't think they were added in intentionally, just a product of the food contained within.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this flavor again.  Too watery and the taste wasn't that fantastic.  I'll stick to the other flavors from the brand.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",2
B001BDDTB2,"After trying all the flavors I found that 2 of my cats love this food.  The 3rd cat, notoriously picky, will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them, but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in ""regular"" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.  Good for us, but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also, the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this.",4

What it does have going for it: it's an organic product, and the pre-portioned one ounce bags are convenient to carry in a purse or bag. It's high in protein and low in fat. I couldn't really taste the sea salt flavor though.",3
B000X9NRKS,"My two dogs both love pigs ears but I rarely buy them because they can be expensive and (I'm not sure if it is true or not) I've heard that some pigs ears are preserved with formaldehyde.  I decided to try to find a nice alternative to pigs ears and I came across Better Than Ears. The price was fantastic and I ordered a package of them right away.<br /><br />One thing I thought was great about the Better Than Ears was that it is a very clean and mess-free treat, it also has a nice aroma that my younger dog went wild for.  My older dog is a bit more picky about treats and she wasn't too impressed by the Better Than Ear that I gave her.  She just guarded it for a long while before she ultimately decided to eat it.<br /><br />The one thing that I am docking a star for on this product is that it doesn't last nearly as long as a real pig's ear.  The material is very soft and easily eaten and I was hoping for a treat that takes a little while longer for my dogs to eat, in the way that natural pigs ears do.  I've been freezing my Better Than Ears, which makes them a little tougher and last a little longer, but not by much.",4
B002IEZJMA,"Let's face it, espresso is not for the casual coffee drinker.  It's highly concentrated, and generally tastes terribly bitter.  But I thought I'd give this illy drink a whirl anyway. It does seem a bit tame for espresso -- which is a good thing if you're not an aficionado; but for those who love espresso, this will likely be too dilute. I think illy's canned cappuccino drink tastes much better.  But I guess if you're a serious coffee drinker, having an espresso on the go like this would be a good thing.  I think the price is relatively fair considering the cost of packaging, manufacturing, distribution, et al, but at the end of the day, I still think it's far too steep a price for canned coffee.  Overall, it's just ok.",2

B004XTDNJE,"I prepared them like I had them prepared for me when I was at a Buddhist monastery, cleaned, sliced thinly and salted and peppered and they were great at the monastery but these had a funky stronger odor and a slightly moldy flavor, though I couldn't see any mold on the product.  I've frozen the ones I didn't use and will thaw later to see if that helps with the flavor.  It's not worth returning but I wouldn't recommend them.",2
B005HGOIQ4,"Well, I like to make my own simple syrups to add to beverages, and this syrup turns out a caramel color, just a bit darker than the granules themselves.  It ends up giving the beverages a funky color....<br /><br />As I said before, the Madhava Organic Coconut Sugar is not as sweet in my mouth, and I do end up using more to keep a similar taste, increasing the caloric impact.  That, coupled with the color in my items, I may not purchase it again until I decide to cut my sugar uptake.  I don't now how it will taste with the recipes on the site as I generally do not bake, but with the simple syrup the color is so pronounced. ;-(<br /><br />I got this off the Gold Box deal and it was a great price, so that is not a disappointment.",3

These ""treats"" are so pure and nutritious.  I don't ever give my guys rawhide, but like rawhide, the Happy Hips are a little tough to chew and that helps clean their teeth.  Our guys like the duck as well as the chicken.  I'd like to recommend that you subscribe to these so you don't ever run out!  I get a monthly shipment of each flavor and we're good to go!

B002QWP89S,"I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.<br /><br />For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up.",2
B003M63C0E,We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own.

With three boys scattered all over the place, I appreciate the handy single-serve sacks. That way, they don't sit down and eat an entire large bag.",3
B000JUK4OS,"I ordered these simply out of curiosity. All those rumors about space food people have been spreading around. First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours.",4
B007RTR9E2,"I've tried other conditioners in the Clear line and for some reason this one was a little lackluster. I figured with the addition of Shea butter, this conditioner would have even more moisturizing power, but it was just average. My hair was soft, but it didn't feel completely moisturized. I had to use a leave-in to achieve the desired results. I was also a little disappointed in the scent. It didn't have the wow factor of the other conditioners and seemed bland. Overall, this was product was average.",3
B001BM3C0Q,I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil.

Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or ""silky"" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat.

It is quite a bit more expensive than my usual brand of canned cat food (Fancy Feast), but it obviously contains whole seafood, which Fancy Feast does not.<br /><br />I dinged it one star because it is very watery, but otherwise I have no complaints. Unlike some canned cat foods, Petite Cuisine does not smell bad (as long as you don't mind a fishy smell). I would buy this again if I saw it on sale, but I probably wouldn't pay full price for it.",4

There's something about the aroma and taste of their teas that does not agree with my senses.  Maybe it's the cloying smell of the bergamot in their Earl Grey.  I prefer Twinings, especially their Lady Grey tea over Stash.  Of all the teas I've tried so far, Ahmad's fruit-flavored teas are my favorite (especially the Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea, but the mango is good as wel).  Aroma and taste is amazingly refreshing.",3
B004RO7NZ0,"Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.<br /><br />The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED.",2

These are not as good as those are, but they are still pretty tasty. I like the crunchies in the crunchy peanut butter. I also think they taste better when you keep them in the fridge. I like to have mine with a glass of milk and they do a good job at keeping me full. I like how they are packed with nutrition and its great how much protein they have. This bar would be perfect for me if it had some fiber though. I also ordered the cookies and cream think thin bites and I really like those for snacks throughout the day. I like those out of the fridge better too.",4

B004K30HO2,"We have had a Keurig Mini Brewer for over 2 years and the family really likes it!  We all have different tastes and we like the idea of preparing a cup of our choice, without wasting an entire pot.  We enjoy hot chocolate, hot tea, iced tea, and, of course, coffee - but, even then, we like a good cup of ""morning"" coffee, flavored coffee during the day, and decaf at night - so the pot is in use constantly and with a variety of goodies.<br /><br />I was given a gourmet assortment of ground coffee, and it has been sitting on the shelf for quite awhile.  But, now, thanks to the disposable K-cups, I am finally able to experiment with some lovely new flavors, while the ""stuffy die-hards"" in the family can stay with their favorite brew.  As soon as I saw the disposable K-cups and filters I knew I had to order this product. It's easy to use - disposable - and it's just as fast to make a cup of delicious coffee in this container as it is to stand over the two-drawer rack trying to decide which flavor to choose.

B0054TWQ2C,"Ramen cups (or bowls, in this case) are a guilty pleasure. I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.<br /><br />Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.<br /><br />All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3-star rating is based solely on that. If sodium and healthy eating are concerns, you can work your way down the star scale from there.",3

B004AHBMJW,"I LOVE Merrick's products. I bought the Ranger Rib and was disappointed when I made my 6 month old German Shepherd mix spit out a small and very sharp shard he chewed off. It would have been easy for that piece to cut through his intestines if he were to swallow it. Hopefully he didn't swallow any pieces while I wasn't looking; I only had my eyes off him for maybe 8 minutes before he chewed through it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you watch your dog like a hawk while he/she chews it or if it's bought for a small dog that can't break off pieces easily -- there are other Merrick's bones that are much better; I bought ""The Sarge"" and my dog loves it!",3
B001LGGH40,"This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.",3
B001EQ5J8C,"I came across the Fizz Pops here by accident and ordered them immediately.  I hadn't had them since I was a kid and wanted to see if they were similar to those I remembered.  My grandparents used to bring one for me and one for my sister every time they visited.  I also recall them being in glass jars on the counters of small stores as we drove ""up north"" to visit grandma and grandpa.  I don't know what brand they were, but they were almost identical to these Paskesz Fizz Pops.  The best way I can describe them is that they are like compressed confectioner's sugar with a very light fruit flavor.  Kind of like the texture of a sweet-tart, but without the tart.  If you suck on them like a regular lollipop, it will hurt your tongue and the roof of your mouth.  They don't dissolve in the same way that hard candy does.  Instead, you kind of chip away at them with your teeth and chew the little pieces that come off.  Now, if I didn't have this good childhood memory, I admit there's a chance that trying them as an adult for the first time, I might not be that excited about them.  But, it was fun to find them again.  Everyone in our family liked them.  And, I found one friend who remembered having these as a child, too and said ""Oh, I missed those lollipops that hurt your mouth if you sucked on them too hard!""  So, if you don't compare them to a regular lollipop and judge them on their own, you might find you like them, too.",4
B001BDDTB2,"With all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine, it's important to know where your pet food originates. This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day. The dry food is at will - they munch on that when they like. So far, so good. No increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients, either. Their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food.",4
B004WM0ZTS,"I've been a fan of Starbucks Via since it was first introduced.  As a pregnant (and now breastfeeding) woman, my caffeine intact is restricted to one cup of coffee a day.  I'm lazy and not willing to go to the trouble to make a pot of coffee for just one cup, so I switched to Via.  I don't think I'll ever go back.  I've tried all the Via varieties, including the Decaf Italian Roast and the various flavor blends (mocha, vanilla, etc.).  This Columbia variety is one of my favorites.  It's not as bold as the Italian or French Roast varieties, but it has a smoother and mellower taste and will appeal to those who like a well-balanced cup of coffee.  Good work, Starbucks, and keep the new varieties coming!",5

B001BDDTB2,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.",1

Like my homemade rye bread, this mix also produces a dense, heavy bread.  I like it that way as I'm not very fond of the American fluff.<br />The flavor was quite disappointing.  It's difficult to describe....it's too bitter and way too sourdough-ish.  My trash can now smells of beer from the the sourdough packet.  If you like a bitter beer that you need to chew then by all means go for this mix.  The aftertaste is indescribable.....very bitter and medicinal.<br />At $5 per loaf this is way overpriced.<br /><br />My advice:  Keep a jar of sourdough and make your own.",2

B001EQ55ZO,"Ok, when you start screwing with the original delicious flavor of cashews, then you are experimenting randomly.  These do not taste good!  Plain and simple.  Pepper belongs on eggs only and NOT on cashews.  There is a tangy citrisy flavor that doesn't make it either.<br /><br />I honestly say, I tried a handful, husband tried a handful and we said, NO WAY!  The claim is SEA Salt, whatever that is;  I know I wouldn't drink sea water, so why would I like SEA Salt.  The cashews are hot and spicy and overall, the heavy seasonings take away the original flavor, and without original flavor you have something completely different.<br /><br />Cashews generally are a good source of snacks and these have no transfat which is good.  It's a good thing I have a few enemies in my lifetime, because they will deserve these!....Rizzo",1

I only had one small sample to try and it's difficult to give a solid opinion on just a 2 cup trial. Right off though It lacked the full body of Starbucks House Blend or Italian Roast that I love but it's still pretty darn good coffee and I liked it better the more I drank it. If you have acid issues this may be worth a try. It is high in caffeine apparently because I felt a bit more wired then usual after drinking it so don't mistake low acid for low octane this still packs a punch!

B001BDDTB2,"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",3

No local store carried them, so I turned to Amazon.com in hopes of finding them. As soon as I discovered them on the list of foods carried by Amazon, I ordered a box.<br />When the box of chips arrived, I opened a bag of the  Riceworks Salasa Fresca chips, only to find not a single whole chip. The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product, but, most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.<br />It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping. Because of the condition of the chips upon arrival, I will not buy them from Amazon.com again.<br />Great Chips when they are whole. A great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces.",3
B001E5DQGK,"This may not be the best truffle oil out there but for the price, it's very good, especially for an avid home cook. This oil is very aromatic and the flavor stands up well in soups and other foods. I use it a lot in soups. The best part for me is that this is affordable enough to try on all sorts of dishes I make at home. I've had truffle oil infused dishes at fine restaurants and I think the biggest difference, for my palate, is that the more expensive oils are slightly smoother in after taste. My husband can't tell the difference. But that is mostly due to the type of olive oil used from what I've been told, which makes sense since olive oil taste varies from brand to brand (and quality!). Nonetheless, I think the Urbani White Truffle Oil is a great way to add that extra dazzle to meals at home without sacrificing taste or money.",4

Especially if it is a food product.<br /><br />EDIT 12/17/2011<br />Due to my concerns, I phoned Luck Chen and spoke at length about my apprehensions.  The noodles Luck Chen LLC produced were manufactured in China.  The MannaSoy product is manufactured in Israel.  My over critical mind assumed that because on Luck Chen's website (the LLC that is at the 'top' of the business structure, at least as product description reads ""Manufacturer: Luck Chen') then I felt all products under that name would be suspect of quality as well.  My concerns were fostered by lack of distinction on either Luck Chen's or Manna Soy's websites detailing the different countries of manufacture and lack of highlighting this applies solely to the noodle bowls; the Luck Chen representative said he hadn't considered how that may play out in a customer's mind and said he would work on clearing up that distinction on the websites.<br /><br />I now feel confident in ordering some of the MannaSoy product and giving it a spin in my wok.

The strength was perfect in my opinion.<br /><br />The flavor of the dark roast comes through clear. I loved the smokiness left on my tongue after the cup, but there is no bitterness. It's smooth and satisfying. My husband, the dark roast skeptic, said there was no way he would like French roast.

It is a pleasant but definitely lacking character, especially when you compared it to the Numi Iron Goddess or Bao Hai Oolong varietals.  Nice for the money, but I think I would rather pay twice as much for a better Oolong.",3
B000SATIGO,"I normally like Assam teas, but this is pretty bland -- the flavor is simple & shallow.  There's no richness, earthiness or depth.  Considering that this a pound bag of the stuff, if you buy it there'll be a lot of boring tea to slog through (or throw out).<br /><br />One reviewer commented about the paper package impairing retention of flavor.  FWIW, while the outer bag is paper, it's plastic-coated on the inside; it may not be a hermetic seal, but it's adequate.  Based on my experience, if you're spooning single servings, you can probably expect the wire fold-closure to break halfway through the bag, so have a clothespin around.",3
B000VK8HCW,"Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that ""Turkey & Chicken Formula"" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated"".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.",3

B007K449CE,"I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCUTKI"">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KN8UA"">Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043OYFJQ"">Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> watched in fear.<br /><br />All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised ""bio nutrium 10"", a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.<br /><br />The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  Despite the label saying ""strong"", you don't feel a tingle or cooling sensation.  Rather, you get the strong smell of tea-tree oil which can be good or bad depending on your preference.<br /><br />The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff, but I noticed that an hour later, I could still smell tea-tree oil in my hair.  The other Clear Men's products did not linger so long.<br /><br />I like the Clear Men's line, but this particular formulation was not my favorite.  I didn't get a strong feel while on my scalp, but the smell seemed to follow me for hours.  I also needed to use conditioner afterwards as it seemed to strip my hair of volume and shape.  It doesn't claim to be ""2 in 1"", but even as regular shampoo, I was surprised.<br /><br />I recommend you look at one of the other fine Clear products I reviewed.  3 stars.",3
B007JFXWSG,"I love chamomile, especially when the weather gets colder. I was especially excited to give this product a try after hearing about one of the other flavors via Amazon Vine, so I went out of my way to keep my eyes open for this on the shelves of various supermarkets. I have to say that I'm somewhat underwhelmed.<br /><br />Now normally you don't have to brew a chamomile bag too overly long to really start getting flavor from it, but this one I had to steep for a longer period of time. If you like a strong cuppa, you'll want to either brew this for a very long time or you'll want to use two tea bags as one of the other reviewers recommends. This sort of irritates me, as I shouldn't have to use two teabags to get a stronger flavor. This won't bother everyone, but it does bother me somewhat.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, it's not bad once you tease out a bolder flavor. If you want mild you can easily get that out of this, but this is better when you let it steep for as long as possible. The pineapple isn't a very strong flavor here, which I preferred. I don't know that I'd have liked it if the pineapple overwhelmed the chamomile, but if you're hoping for a big pineapple taste then you'll be disappointed. Where this does very well is that when this is at its strongest, you don't have to use much or any sweeteners. It could be drunk without, if you don't have sweeteners or if you choose to go without.<br /><br />Overall this is decent but I think I'll probably pass on this particular flavor of chamomile tea from Lipton in the future, or at least not go out of my way to purchase a whole box. On a side note, I want to warn that the tea bags are fairly fragile and that when removing the string, you have to be gentle. I've torn one of the bags because I was a little too quick when detaching the string.",3
B00374W5G8,"When this product became a ""Helper Complete Meal"" instead of just a regular ""Complete Meal"", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not ""Alfredo"" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere. The mexican-style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise, for the same price.",2

It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!",5
B00474ARU8,"My parents fell in love with 'San Francisco Bay Coffee Company' coffee, which use to be available at our local AZ Costco.

They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co, but I wanted something bigger, and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble, but if you look closely it's ""Roger's Family Company"" coffee, who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area.

I thought it to be a rather bland-tasting chicken noodle  soup, but that's because most chicken soups have such a high sodium content. This one is relatively low and, in fact, the potassium content is higher than the sodium content, which is almost unheard of in Campbell's soups. It's fairly low in calories also so a whole can (two servings) only amounted to 220 calories. Also, the fat content is low and the protein content is fairly high. I'm surprised they don't label this a ""diet soup."" Both the spiral noodles and the vegetables (carrots and celery) are fairly large and ""chunky"" and all seem bland and overcooked.

B001E6IZVU,"I bought this product because I wanted to eat a healthy cereal and at the same time add more fiber to my diet.  I chose All Bran because it did not contain aspartame.  I got home and started reading the ingredients & realized the second ingredient is sugar and also contains high fructose corn syrup. It has 8 grams of sugar per serving, but they list a serving as only 1/3 cup.  Who do they think they are kidding?  An average American eats more than that for breakfast.  Do they think consumers are stupid?<br /><br />A box of Kashi 7 Whole Grain Flakes with Black Currants & Walnuts cereal lists a serving as 1 cup and contains only 10 grams of sugar for that whole cup.  Uncle Sam cereal with Real Mixed Berries contains NO added sweetner of any kind and 1 cup of it contains only 2 grams of naturally occuring sugar coming mostly from the berries.  Wow!  You mean a cereal manufacturer is brave enough to make a cereal without adding sugar?  Yes and it is good.  In comparison eating 1 cup of All Bran Buds would be consuming 24 grams of sugar.  No thanks!<br /><br />If anyone at Kellogg's is reading this please know that people who are buying these types of cereals are not buying them primarily for the taste but for the health benefits.  We are not the ""Kindergarten Crowd"" who needs sugar added to everything to get us to eat it.  If I want to consume extra sugar I'll eat a cookie once in a while as a treat.  If I am going to eat a cereal everyday to incorporate fiber into my diet it is not going to be one that has unneeded amounts of sugar.<br /><br />Why can't the big name cereal manufacturers use stevia as an alternative sweetner?  It has been used for years in Europe with no known side effects. The consumers buying these types of cereals who are trying to watch their sugar consumption and increase their fiber would gladly welcome less or preferably no sugar or a healthy sweetner such as stevia.",2
B004X3VRLG,"No one in our household liked these, of course it was only the 3 dogs that sampled them! Our neighbor's Boxer mix loved them, and our Maltese did snap up the bits that fell from his chomping. The wee ones had no interest in the treats when they were whole, however.",3
B0026N8W4U,"I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An internet order was lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number. When asked for one the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. Ann, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future.

B000E65OF6,"Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5

I called Yuban today and they could tell me what stores in my area have sold it in the last 30 days.<br />You can also purchase it on line is what I did for 12 cans.

B002LANN56,"I may want to live on caramel and ice cream, butterfingers and apple pie - but after a few months of this diet, I'd be an overweight diabetic. This dog food, even though the name sounds (lets use the thesaurus here) resplendent, delightful, and even pulchritudinous (!) - is canine candy. I mean, come on - ""Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin""? Sounds like something I'd want to eat. But read further, and it's ""sirloin flavored"" and is full of corn and other fillers.  Sure, the way my dog devoured this looked like I had not fed him in days - he was ready to lick the chrome off the bowl. ""Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin"" is a name dreamed up by the marketing department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the food is flavor and filler, low quality protein, and high in carbs/calories.  If your dog is a lay-about, couch potato, indoor pooch - this stuff is better as a mix-in for finicky eaters, or as an occasional treat. A dog will have to be pretty active to burn off the calories if this was his/her staple.<br /><br />A week later? The dog won't touch it. Just nuzzles the stuff and gives it a tentative lick.

B000KV61FC,"As far as treat dispensing toys go, this is by far the best design. My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking.",4

B004CLCEDE,"How do you make these delicious?<br /><br />Hold your nose, snip the bag open and pour into a colindar with your faucet on hot full blast; if you have a spray option use it to cover the noodles better.  I let this rinse and drain in the hot water for a full minute, agitating the noodles the whole time to REALLY rinse them well.  I then put them in a salad spinner and spin them dry.  I place them in a bowl and nuke for 90 seconds, then I give them another spin to get them dry again.  While still hot, I place them in a big bowl and cover with a zesty pasta sauce, stir and let them sit for several minutes while I boil pasta for my hubby and daughter.  When their's is ready, I sprinkle mine with cheese, add a few meatballs and nuke again until very hot.  We all get a spagetti dinner on the table at the same time and I get to keep my plate well under 10 carbs.<br /><br />Prepared this way, I think they taste very good.  I also do a spicy Thai peanut sauce that I also have the noodles sit in before heating and enjoying with grated carrots, sliced green onions and shredded cabbage.  I think it is important to really let the noodles rest in the sauce of your choice so they have a chance to absorb flavor.  If you do not do this, they taste awful!  I just rinsed and heated them the first time I had them and hated them.  I went through the above process to rid them of the packing water, which is the element I couldn't like.  I am not bothered by the texture because I dress them with a lot of textures so I never notice them tasting different.  I would not cook these and dress with only butter and cheese, you need to bury them a bit in a hearty dish.  I have snipped these smaller and made a great tuna casserole that my family liked too.<br /><br />I have not tried the fetaccini cut, but the smaller angel hair melds easily into dishes, a thicker noodle may be more rubbery.<br /><br />If you spend the prep time they are great!",4

I/we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son brought a pack of Ahmad Tea back with him (from Jolly Old..) as a gift, we were sold. We found the flavor splendid. We loved it. It is fully flavored and needs NO sugar/milk/sweetener at all.

With the honey already included, it is excellent if you feel a scratchy throat or sniffle coming on.  I think you will like it as much as I did.",4
B0041NYV8E,"I really tried this with an open mind. I love hot tea in the afternoon as well as other 'soothing' drinks. But this one was a killer. It comes as a powder to mix with hot water. It doesn't say how much water on the packet so I assumed that one packet is for one cup of water (as per the directions on this site).<br /><br />One sip put me into the gag zone. I'm sorry to say that it was horrible. It was bitter, spicy, too strong, and way over the top. I like ginger but in small doses. This was like chewing on a piece of ginger root. I guess there are some people that like that but for me, it was not a good experience. I tried additional sips just to be sure but it was a killer taste each time. And, it's hard to get the strong ginger taste out of your mouth.<br /><br />I know this is a personal choice but my choice is to stay away.<br /><br />*****Added note*****<br />My husband tried it and liked it. He would have given it a 3-4 star rating. It just goes to show the difference in what our taste buds like and how this is truly a personal taste opinion.",1
B000ICO8GW,"I can't believe the ripoff Gevalia is getting away with in this country. Yes, as a coffee it's OK, certainly better than  most coffees sold in the U.S. But then most Americans don't know what good coffee is.<br /><br />My objection is the price. Gevalia sells in markets in Sweden for between 19 and 29 Swedish Crowns, that is, between $2.32 and $3.65 for a half/kilo package, a bit more than a pound. It's the Folgers of Sweden, an average coffee at best. Idiot Americans are willing to pay 6 times the going rate out of sheer lunacy.<br /><br />My wife and I have a second home in Sweden and drink Gevalia there, but it's cheap coffee. If you want your Gevalia but don't like getting ripped off just go to Ikea where it's sold at a reasonable price.",1

B002PNGY28,"We recently adopted a shelter kitten and our vet recommended several natural food brands that she felt were superior to our regular supermarket cat food.  As we feel our new addition deserves the best we can give her we not only wanted to make sure her regular food was of high quality and good for her but as our vet said, don't forget to check that her treats are high quality/natural too.  As we were already purchasing the Wellness brand from her list, we tried these treats.<br /><br />On first glance I thought, wow, almost $5.00 for this little bag, that's pricey, but they are very small jerky type treats and they last a long time if you are only giving your pet a few at a time.  My cat loves these and we have found that her coat seems to be very shiny and silky-not sure if these treats contribute, but they could.  We love the fact that they don't have corn, wheat, soy or a bunch of other stuff she really doesn't need.  We also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat....it worked!  People laugh, but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down.  If you don't give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again....smart kitty and she loves those treats.  This is the first flavor we tried, but have since tried others and she loves them all.<br /><br />If you would like to try something more natural for your kitty, I would give these a go.  We have been more than pleased and these are now the only treats we consider buying for her.",5

B001LG945O,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.<br /><br />Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.",2

I would need to use a clip to reseal the bulk package after one or two beef sticks.  A lot of the reviews mention that they aren't individually wrapped, but don't really make a big deal about it.

B001E5DQGK,"I bought this for my last birthday, thanks to a gift card I was sent.  I should say that for it's price, this is a perfectly decent brand of white truffle oil.  I use it for making omelets, sauteing vegetables and even as an ingredient for salad dressings.  If you like a garlicky white truffle flavor, this is a good brand and can even make a good gift, depending upon your budget.<br /><br />There is a bit of confusion.  When I read about this on-line, it says it is an infusion.  Other places both on-line and by the manufacturers say it is ""truffle-essence.""  There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An ""essence"", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white-truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.  This brand could be both and as a general rule I trust Urbani products.  Still, for a simple and less expensive oil used for general cooking, this is good for its price-point.  I would generally recommend a truffle salt (with truffle shavings) for a more authentic truffle experience.",4

B001LGGH40,"I've tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn't enjoy this flavor I didn't find it as refreshing as the others.<br /><br />I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.<br /><br />However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it's too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity.

B0052UOQY4,"My cats love Weruva's Love Me Tender Pouch.  They are super picky and this one is a huge hit.  We also feed Pumpkin Lickin' Chicken and while they like it, they will leave bits of the chicken about.  The Love Me Tender is all gone, even if they aren't starving.  I've fed it to some foster cats who love it as well, but they seem to leave one particular bit on the plate consistently.<br /><br />It is made in Thailand - which shouldn't be a problem.  I was hesitant at first, I generally only buy my cat food from American produced sources, but I did my research and found that Weruva did their research and Thailand has very good protections to make sure your animals will get safe food - possibly it has more protections than the U.S.  I won't link here but do your research if you are concerned.<br /><br />Opening the packet is easy.  The food is kind of chunky with a lot of gravy, for those of you who have gravy loving cats.  I wish this was around when my cat with kidney failure needed food because I think it would have given me a nice way to get some calories and liquid down her.  Remember, if you are feeding only packets, they usually have fewer calories per ounce than a comparable pate style food.  I generally feed it as a ""Please don't wake me up early asking for food"" treat late at night so I'm happy with the lower calorie content.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is difficult to get every last bit of product out of the packet.  The food itself is a 5.  The packets have those folds at the bottom so they can stand upright and the food and goo get stuck in there.  I use a spoon to get the last bits out but I feel like I always leave a little in there.  It isn't cheap so I want to get every bit of yumminess out. I also would be open to buying bigger packets.",4

I will definitely keep eating them though because they do work.  I had one for breakfast two days in a row and did not find myself feeling hungry until it was lunch time.  On the third day I decided to try a bowl of cereal (Cheerios to be exact) because it was convenient.  An hour after I ate the cereal I felt as if I was starving.  Thank goodness I had an apple with me because I devoured it but was still hungry!  Obviously the cereal did not satisfy me the way the bars did.  I will keep eating them and am curious about trying the protein shakes.",4

B001EPPIT8,"the idea of this product is good, but it was way too salty for me. I couldn't eat it, and it wasn't cheap. I don't eat salt or sodium-ladened food if possible anymore, so this set me through the roof.<br /><br />If you enjoy salty food, you'll like this.",2
B002ZJ4JF6,"I was eager to try these after I heard about them, but ended up being rather disappointed.  I love chocolate and marshmallows and thought this mix looked delicious, so I picked it over the other varieties available.  Unfortunately, the mini marshmallows are nothing like marshmallows -- I was expecting them to be like those found packaged with hot chocolate or in cereals, but they're solid little sugar pellets that are way too hard to chew comfortably.  The graham cracker pieces are also overly crunchy and unpleasant.  The coconut flakes, which I would generally imagine are hard to mess up, seem to be more sugar than coconut...they pretty much melt in your mouth, but not in the good way.  The milk chocolate candies are good (mine did not contain peanut butter as another reviewer mentioned), as are the cocoa roast almonds and honey roasted peanuts.<br /><br />I had been wanting to try the Chocolate Cherry mix, but after this experience, I'm not so sure.  Emerald had a good idea that was, unfortunately, shoddily executed and left me with the opinion that they should stick with what they know...nuts.",2
B000PDY3P0,"We bought this for our Paramount 6 oz popper. We were disappointed by the taste. We've been using LouAna Coconut oil (~[..] from Walmart for 31.5 fl.oz.), Act II popcorn salt and O.R. kernels. After the first mouthfuls of Great Northern Popcorn, people were pushing their bowls aside---it tasted like salted cardboard. Never again---so disappointed.",1
B000FA38ZY,"I've seen Mallomars on the shelves for years but never felt that urge to purchase them. But I was finally able to give them a try and I was glad I did.<br /><br />When I bit into my first Mallomar, it took me a minute to get used to the texture and the taste. It's chocolate covered marshallow on a graham cracker. I expected there to be some crunch from the cracker but the entire cookie is soft. The chocolate crumbles a little when you bite into it. After eating two more, I decided that I liked them. And that I needed to put the box away fast or I was going to consume them in one sitting.<br /><br />Mallomar is a nice alternative to s'mores. It's neater and you don't burn your mouth because the marshallow is too hot. So now I finally know what the hype is all about.<br /><br />3/5",3

B005QRPH78,"Thought I would try something new since my mixed breed senior stopped eating the daily morning bone (!) we would give him for breakfast (Iam's brand).  He immediately took to these, which kind of surprised me given they are...""spicy"" and I never knew him to like things like that.  Who knew dogs like cinnamon?!<br /><br />Anyhoo, seems to like them fine, and I definitely like the fact that they are lo cal, but the price...geez...a little overpriced!  I always thought the Greenies were good, but crazy expensive, and these seem to be priced at least as high as Greenies.<br /><br />Also, the fact that the manufacturer instructions indicate two of these sticks a day, and the fact that there are about 6-8 a pack, seems a little crazy.  So buy 2 packs a week?!  Come on...make a box with 30 or 40 if you want people to actually follow your instructions without buying a silly amount of bags of these things (and hopefully to help get cost down)!  They probably don't do this because people would get sticker shock if they saw these priced in a box (would be approx. $30-$40!)<br /><br />Pricing is way off, but product seems to be good.<br /><br />Edit:  After trying these out, I signed up for a ""subscription"" to have the larger version (in the shape of bones) delivered via Amazon...and for my biggish dog, I like the bone version much better...he spends more time chewing it (partly why I wanted these was to use as a teeth cleaning device).  If you have a big dog (>70 lbs or so I guess), you might want to check out the Large Zoe dental chew treats instead.  Also note that the ""subscribe and save"" option via Amazon makes the cost much more palatable, so diminishes my complaint about price somewhat.",3
B001TZL6ZS,"Baconnaise is so good - it really tastes like bacon, just creamier. I would highly recommend this product.",4
B004SRH2B6,"What this is:  coconut water - not coconut milk - flavored with chocolate.<br /><br />Coconut water is taken from green coconuts - they haven't had the time to form the meat or milk yet.  Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts.  It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories.  I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.<br /><br />This chocolate flavor is excellent imho.  It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.<br /><br />Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.<br /><br />Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.<br /><br />About me:  I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give ""5""-star reviews.",4
B00474HUXA,These olives tasted very metallic to me as well as guests for whom I had prepared a couscous salad.  I will not order them again.,1
B0009XQSAY,"Update:  Please note per my information below: product description and photo are no longer accurate.  The product has a sealed lid, not a ""pop-top lid"" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed.  See below for the correct information.  I have notified Amazon of this error.  Somehow 5 grams of protein have been ""lost"" from the can contents.<br /><br />I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one, get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can).  This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more.<br />I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat.  This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use.  The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item.  The meat flakes into small pieces easily, so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it.  It would also make a good filling for enchiladas, tortillas or quesadillas.  I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product.  It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks.  For those who don't like tuna, it's a great alternative.<br />Basically, it's chicken when you need it ready to go, and it is a good source of protein with very little fat.  One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories, 9 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV), 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?).  If sodium is a concern, consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer.<br />It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long!  It's fresh when you need it.  I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some)<br />Update:<br />Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese.<br />I haven't tried the concoction yet, but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast.",5

After I ran out I decided to order two more bags of the English Breakfast and Assam Banaspaty.  To my great dissapointment, both are old and flavorless.  It seems like Davidson's did not store them properly.  They become bitter quickly if I brew them long enough to get any flavor out of them and I've resorted to mixing it with other tea just so it isn't a total waste.  The reality, is that I wasted $32 on tea that is only really good for making water brown.  : (<br /><br />The quality control issue and randomness of getting a good batch from Davidson's make it not a good value.  I'd rather pay more to know I'm getting consistent quality and not something that might be a total waste.<br /><br />I was really excited when I first discovered Davidson's because I drink a lot of tea and they have attractive pricing but my second order was such a huge let-down that they've lost me as a customer.",2

I decided to work with the amount used for each pot and ultimately ended up using less than recommended and it turned out to be very good. I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this brand but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong, rich blend this is the coffee for you. By using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong, rich, flavorful cup of very good coffee.

These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.",2

B000G6RYNE,"Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!).",5

Unfortunately, this type of almonds is getting more and more difficult to find in my local stores, so I was happy to be able to order a 6-pack from Amazon to have in my pantry.",5
B001EQ55RW,"I like these more than I thought I would. They're sort of the inverse of a chocolate bar with almonds: instead of a lot of chocolate and few almonds, you get a lot of almonds and a little chocolate flavor.

Also, and unlike conventional chocolate-covered nuts, these will not turn into a lumpy, gooey, mess if you leave them in the car this time of year.",4

Plus, I love the way the curls keep making the popping sound in my mouth as I eat them... like Pop Rocks candy!  I got the regular which is salted just enough for my taste.

B0045IK1CK,"My husband and I are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!",5

B001BDDTB2,"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",3

Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it..

This stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah. It goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth.

B004CLCEDE,"This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite ""deal"" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. Seriously, Google ""Doctor Cyberman innards"" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are.",1
B001VXYCHM,"Despite how many regions of the USA can grow pumpkins, the market for roasted in-shell pumpkin seeds is dominated by David (Conagra) due to their distribution abilities.  Although David's seeds are too salty, they are a consistent product with good flavor, dense nut meats and well regulated moisture content.  And yes,did I mention that they are too salty.  So when I came upon the high praise given to these seeds, I bought a 12 pack.  As noted, the price on these is significantly lower than Davids.<br /><br />However, I am disappointed with the product.  The first issue I noticed was the lack of grading.  Fallow seeds (flat seeds with no nut meat) and other irregular seeds are included in quantities which vary from pack to pack, but there are too many.  Additionally the nutmeats are quite inconsistent in density and moisture content.  Some nut meats have little density and just crumble during the shelling process. The shells are quite a bit thinner than the David brand, which causes them to collapse, rather than cleanly splitting, when pressured on the edges.  This transfers a lot of the salty shell into your mouth.  So although these have less salt on them, more salt is ingested in the process of eating them.<br /><br />You might be happy with these if you are looking for a cheaper product than the David brand, but I was looking for a superior product and these are not it.",2

B0045XE32E,"These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5"" on each side and 1/4"" thick.  So for a small dog, they're pretty big. I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon's 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal.",4

It's so tasty that it doesn't need anything to add to the flavor but sliced peaches or blueberries are a nice touch.<br /><br />Since the product comes in handy packets, it's also convenient to bring to work and have a quick, energetic snack, all that's needed is to add milk or boiling water and it's all set.<br /><br />It's also microwavable.

My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)",5

I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product.",1

There is no way that 3 bags of chocolate do me any good 3 days after Halloween. It wasn't until the day before Halloween that I received a notification that my candy wouldn't arrive on time. I had hoped to use Amazon for all my Halloween candy. I will never try this again. I ended up buying chocolate on my own to give the kids, and then took the chocolate I received from Amazon to work.

B000LKVDO6,"This Kitchens of India discount purchase was disappointing. It is lacking in taste and texture.  While the product has a lot of salt, I stilll found it rather tasteless.  The curry's texture was not pleasant.  Many curries that I enjoy most are thick and have a tomato paste type texture.  This one was watery with semi-mashed up chunks of vegetables.  It was not pleasant on the tongue and even combining it with rice and naan did not make it something I would want to eat again.<br /><br />This product is packaged in the ever-popular pouch inside of a box. I don't really like pouches because the contents are usually difficult to remove. True to my previous experience with pouches, I had to use a spatula to remove the contents that had stuck to the pouch's walls. Another reason for my disdain of pouches is they are not typically recyclable.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this product is lacking.  Each container has 2 1/2 servings and a serving is about Â½ cup.  So, let's look at the numbers for a container, which would realistically serve two people when paired with rice, naan, or vegetables; the total fat per container is 37.5 grams, total sodium is 2300 mg, total saturated fat is 6.25 grams, total carbs of 40 grams.<br /><br />I've found Kitchens of India products to be hit or miss in terms of taste.  I like Jyoti products (come in a can for the most part) MTR products (come in a pouch) better.  Disclaimer: While some Jyoti products (their saag, for example) are healthy, MTR products are typically full fat but at least they taste better.<br /><br />This product is vegetarian but not vegan.<br /><br />This product is made in India.<br /><br />If you really want to try this product and only want one pouch, consider iherb.com.  You can use code LEK375 for a discount.",2

B00269WUTC,"Updated:  I purchased Tilda Basmati because of the rave reviews, WOW whats not to like about getting an even better basmati flavor?  This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.<br />  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls. It decreases the quality of any recipe you use it in.<br />  The only explanation for all these rave reviews that I can see is that they're generated by the company, or that the purchasers have never tasted real rice before.  This stuff is awful.  After a year of holding it in my refrigerator, much to long to get a refund, I've just finished dumping 9 1/2 pounds of it in the trash.",1

B002TMV3E4,"This is pretty decent coffee, for pre-ground decaf.  Here's how a coffee snob reviews it:<br /><br />* Unpacking *<br />This coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house, and it was hot out.  Heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee.  The package was pretty hard to open, I resorted to scissors.  The grind is very uniform with no detectible dust.  The smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted, non-decaf, beans I usually buy.<br /><br />* Brewing *<br />I busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a Melitta filter.  I poured two cups of 200F water through.  The uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee didn't clog as it does with blade-ground coffee (due to dust).  I drank the coffee black...<br /><br />* Tasting *<br />The smell is of decaf and or instant coffee.  Pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame.  Overall I enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf I've had recently.  There was no biting bitterness.  I drank two cups black without much of a gut ache.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness.<br />- Excellent grind uniformity.<br />- Low bitterness<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not locally roasted.<br />- Not fresh. Best-by date is a year in advance.<br /><br />Verdict: For mail-order, pre-ground decaf, this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable.  3 or 4 stars.",4

I've made it according to the enclosed ""moon brewing"" directions and also in my iced tea maker. It's cloudy both ways.

B001LG945O,"I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink I've ever had.  That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but don't like some of the ingredients.  Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel it's a step in the right direct.  This is an Orange Tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine.  In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.

The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"".

Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it.

B0085G4A7U,the package arrived as a disaster. One bottle of beverage completely leaked out and the original box and the package was watered and damaged. The UPS guy told me he knew something was wrong and suggested me to contact seller.

B0030VBRIU,"I really wish my toddler liked this. It seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet. Every so often he'll eat it, but it usually needs to be mixed with something else.  I think it tastes fine, but it wasn't a hit. I bought a case so I keep trying.",2
B001KX19ZQ,"I love my kitty, and spoil her in every way possible. I feed her can food, and hard food, and I mix up brands to give her a good ""spread"". When I saw this at my local store, I thought ""She is going to love this!""<br /><br />For starters, it comes out of the pack in a strange gelatinous form. (It looks like something from another planet, honestly.) You can see the fish, so I was optimistic. She ate some of the gooey gelatin stuff, sniffed the fish, and started meowing (meaning, please don't let me eat this.) I left it out thinking she would maybe nibble on it more when I wasn't looking, and needless to say, a few hours later, it was still there, only it had dried up significantly. (The gel stuff was gone, it looked like something out of a horror movie, and this happened during the 6 hours I was at work.)<br /><br />**If you have OUTDOOR kitties, don't even go here. This food attracts flies like nothing I've ever seen, and if your kitties don't eat it, you will find yourself with a colony of maggots in a day or two, no kidding. HOT MESS.<br /><br />That being said, our dog ate some of it, but then again, he also eats his own poop when I'm not looking.",2
B002NHYQAS,"Wish I could have rated this higher.  I respect the Newmans and their philanthropy and appreciate the fact the product is premium organic ingredients.  I was looking forward to trying this 54% chocolate bar.<br /><br />I eat a little dark chocolate daily and found this was too sweet for my taste. (To be fair I have had the same problem occasionally with a couple of other brands I've tried over the years.)<br /><br />I usually buy Green & Black's 85% Dark Chocolate or Endangered Species 72% Dark Chocolate. Someone who is used to milk chocolate might like the Newman bar better than I did.<br /><br />As for comparing nutrition facts, all three bars use different portion sizes...so I didn't find it worth the effort.  Newman's 2.25 oz. bar is considered a single serving.  Green & Black's 3.5 oz bar is considered 2.5 servings, and Endangered Species 3 oz. bar is two servings.",1

B000OIT8T2,"I have an interesting relationship with Skittles.  When I was about 10 years old, I absolutely thought they were average at best and couldn't understand what everyone loved so much about them.  ""Too sour, not tasty enough"" was my impression.  Later however, I entered my teenage years and it actually took until I nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me.  What also got me hooked is this kid I remember from 10th grade science class who would ALWAYS bring in a bag of Skittles *every single day* and chew on them, and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality, so Skittles sort of gave me the impression that COOL kids eat Skittles.  However, please buy bags of Skittles from your local grocery store- it's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price.  You can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices.  My only complaint with Skittles is that, despite the color, they *all* taste exactly the same to me!  Purple, green, red, orange, yellow... I really can't taste a difference between these supposed ""different flavors"".  Then again, I don't have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense!",5

It may be the whopping 3 grams of fiber in these tiny little things.  I think it's actually my stomach screaming, ""NO MORE!  I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE FIBER!  I'M GONNA BLOW!""<br /><br />They remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy Eucharist from the late 70's and early 80's.  Heavy, moist, whole-grain goodness.  Takes me back to my Catholic school days.  They used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy Jesus after a mass.  Good times.",5

They no longer expel foul odorous waste, which Purina seemed to do to them regularly. Since they've been on Newman's, their waste is almost odorless and, well...it is easy to pick up. You can tell it's nutritious by what comes out, and if you have to pick up after your dog daily, like myself, you'll appreciate the cleaner output.",5

B005BPVE90,"I've been on a real Bar-kick recently, mostly for a quick breakfast on the way out to door as I'm always at least 15 minutes late to work but don't want to skip breakfast.  I started with Cliff bars but those got old.  Then I moved on to Larabars, which are good and come in some interesting flavours, but after eating them for a few weeks I decided they were too sweet for anything more than occasional consumption.<br /><br />My favorite, to date, are the 18 Rabbits Bars <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV0M2E"">18 Rabbits Haute Diggity Date, Organic Granola Bar, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, which are awesome.<br /><br />However, these Eat Think Smile bars were a big surprise ... so far I'd give them the silver medal behind 18 Rabbits, and will keep buying them just to keep some variety.<br /><br />What do I like about these bars?  Let me think about what I like about them ... first, they don't taste like a typical health food bar - while the box says oatmeal raisin, to me they taste more like a brownie (not quite as good as a real brownie but pretty close for a packaged bar).  The second think I really like about these bars is unlike a lot of the bars out there which are too sugary, these are just sweet enough without being sweet but more importantly their carbohydrate content comes from DIETARY FIBER.  28% DV of Dietary Fiber people.  Do you realize like 75% of Americans don't get enough Fiber in their diets?  Hello?<br /><br />So I recommend these and will keep purchasing them myself even though I got this box for free via the Vine program.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this informative review.",4

B000FFIIYU,I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there.  These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes.  I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly.,2

B005MWAM72,"In years past, I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick, easy, hot breakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet-ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch.",2

B000F9Z1XM,"I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list ""high fructose corn syrup"" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.",4

B000EGX2EG,I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.,1

I eat them in salads, smoothies, with oatmeal, made chocolate candy with them, and eat them straight out of the bag!  I have not found a negative thing about them.

Unfortunately they're not quite as I remembered, in look or taste.  Not as much sour to contrast with the sweet, which was was the main thing I really liked about them (hey, I was a weird kid.)  Granted my tastebuds were much younger and more sensitive then, so maybe it's just me.  Different packaging, too.  I remember an opaque, colorful, square wrapper that was just ""twisted"" on, instead of the clear, sealed, somewhat less tamper proof plastic.  In fact I have a heck of a time opening them, but at least I won't be inhaling the whole box anytime soon.  Sadly, the wrapper may just be a sign of the times.

B001EPQQL2,"I am still undecided if this is a sugar free option. I know it is mixed with real brown sugar and therefore it has the drawbacks for people who tries to stir clear away from sugar. As far as the taste it is just like brown sugar and it works very good in all baking endeavors, which was the principal reason for the purchase. It does have sugar but I have not been able to determine how and if is detrimental to those who prefer not to partake in using sugar. I mostly use ezsweet that has 0 everything but needed to use some kind of sugar so I bought this. Perhaps it deserves a higher rating and also there is the chance it might deserve 3 Stars instead of 4. Still, it is a better option than most items out there in the free world so that is why I allocated 4 Stars. Hope this helps and wish all who read this the most wonderful and invigorating holidays, starting with Thanksgiving all the way to the New Year. 4 Stars for Splenda Brown Sugar Blend 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4), which by the way it ended being in quantity much more than I had bargained for but what can you do?

I think I was expecting a fragrance like Tang instant beverage. I certainly didn't expect it to smell like it does. It's not all that bad, it's just not real good.<br /><br />I also think this product would actually taste better if it weren't carbonated.<br /><br />The calories are about the same as a typical soda.

Sadly, some animals were sickened, and even died. After this recall, it's fair to say that many of us had become even more aware of how the pet food industry is regulated and how lapses are corrected, which is a great thing. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes.<br /><br />The FDA posted a new announcement for a voluntary pet food recall on June 18 - relating to Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc.

Hand washing is a must - even when handling dry pet food that may be contaminated with the bacteria.<br /><br />To keep up to date with current recalls and information on pet food safety, visit the FDA's website to view the updated list that includes not only dog and cat foods, but also horse feed.<br /><br />[...]",1

B006Q820X0,"K-Cups I recently purchased this new brand, and the quality of the K-Cups is definitively a problem. The seals on several of the K-Cups have broken and caused quite a mess. The coffee flavor s good when I am able to get a ""good"" cup. When you compare them side by side with other K-Cups you can see a difference in the packaging.<br /><br />I would not recommend this brand unless they make significant changes to their manufacturing and quality control processes.",2
B008FHUDW0,"I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the ""My K cup"" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang.",2

I felt I had to get up and exercise so I wouldn't feel terrible, not because I had more energy. I didn't feel hungry and I had to pee every few minutes. I can't imagine what would have happened if I drank the whole can. I might as well have taken some crazy illegal substance, because the experience was not good!",1

NOTE: If you don't follow the instructions exactly you are opening up opportunity for problems. I brewed for about 7 days. I then bottled and let condition for 2 weeks at room temperature. I then put the beer in the fridge. I tried two bottles the next day. The taste was OK, but it was very flat. I then put more bottles in the fridge and let them sit for 2 weeks. I tried one of these after the two weeks and it was great. The carbonation was perfect and the taste improved even more. Definitely give the beer time to condition. You will be glad you did.",5

Although the convenience and nutrition and pluses, the flavor just leaves a lot to be desired.  To be honest this one would be better if you ate it blindfolded, as the chicken chunks and sauce really make it look like you are eating cat food.  Ignoring the visual appear, or lack thereof, the flavor still doesn't compare to the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken.  I will not be reordering.",2
B008O3G25W,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer.

B0009YD7P2,"When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this ""puppy goo"".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!",3
B004ZIER34,"I can't drink coffee, because I have painful bladder syndrome so I was rather excited to be offered this reduced acid version.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the scent. Perhaps because I haven't drunk any coffee in years, I was pleased by the scent. It smelled like the coffee I remembered and had a pleasing scent. Brewing was easy. I just brewed it through a strainer, added hot water and voila!<br /><br />My first taste, did not necessarily excite me. It *did* have a slight Folgers coffee kind of taste. However, my second and third tastes made me realize how much I liked the stuff. Now I'm hooked. It does taste enough like the real stuff to make me want to buy more.<br /><br />I can give this coffee product, two thumbs up, but if you are an IC suffer, you might try the decaf blend. This blend still is caffeine and might upset your bladder.",4

B005SPQENY,"I really love hot tea, though I've not yet found a commercial iced tea that is to my liking.  Chantea has won awards, so I gave it a shot.  This beverage is basically a mix of green tea, sugar, a bit of passion fruit flavoring, and hunks of aloe vera.  Seriously, there are large and slimy solids in this tea.  I was expecting something more along the lines of pulp in orange juice.  Live and learn.  Aside from the chunks, I think many people will enjoy the flavor of this tea.  The balance of passion fruit flavoring is just right- not too overpowering, not too fake.  I am not a fan of sweetened tea, but many people are, and I did appreciate that this was sweetened with real sugar instead of some fake sweetener.  What really gets me is the aloe vera chunks.  They seem like a gimmick.  If I want to enjoy the health benefits of tea I'll brew my own without processing, bottling, and without sweeteners.",2

B001E5DYSK,Just purchased this at Safeway for $15.99 per 8.8 oz. can which of course is $31.98 for the two that Amazon is offering here for more than $35.00(too expensive) however for ready ground coffee it is AMAZING.  It actually smells and tastes as if one had just put it through the grinder seconds before it went into the machine.,4
B000F4H5F4,"Twinings English Breakfast tea is a good, basic black tea (as is its stronger cousin, Irish Breakfast tea). But I find this loose tea to be a bit of a challenge. It is cut quite finely and no matter how fine the mesh on the infuser or strainer some of this always comes through. I drink a lot of tea and am fine with drinking some tea dust or even a few leaves, but I am talking about a lot of tea here...a teaspoon full or more in each cup.<br /><br />It is true that this tastes better than the bagged variety of Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is smoother and never bitter, as the bagged tea sometimes is. I have compromised and used the loose tea but I strain it through a coffee filter. The tins the tea comes in keep it quite fresh and though straining it is a hassle, it is worth it for me.<br /><br />This is moderately strong (I drink it black) and if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not want to drink it near bedtime. I use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for this tea; it is a good bargain and I like the convenience of having it delivered. It is also hard to find the loose tea in supermarkets.",4

B002G8N4ZW,"I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!",5
B005ZBZLT4,"I picked this up at a Fresh & Easy.  While I like the idea of more choices than the officially licensed K-Cups, this is just not a good coffee.  It tastes bitter and bland.  Not recommended.  Try Millstone's Fogchaser K-Cups instead.",2

B002NHYQAS,"Newman's Own Organic Dark Chocolate Bar is good if you like semi-dark and mildly sweet chocolate that is a little harder with a slightly higher melting point than that of European chocolate of similar expectations. I liked the chocolate very much but I did not find it to have any superior qualities to Hershey's chocolate. The product is sold in a pack of 12 bars but my sample from the ""Vine"" program consisted of only one bar. I am not sure if my opinions would have changed given a larger sample, but my confidence and enjoyment of the review would have been significantly greater by having a larger sample from which to provide a better comparison of quality and quantity with competitive products. I am certain that the people running the Vine Program at Amazon fully understand the importance of having a reasonable sample in quantity and that such quantity that reached the reviewers may have been less than what was originally planned to be a sample of sufficient size. In other words, ""Who ate the chocolate?"" is a question that should be investigated by an independent party and that those with chocolate remnants on their fingers and lips should no longer be allowed to participate in management of the Vine Program.<br /><br />In summary, Newman's chocolate is good, but in my opinion nothing special that could justify the cost. But, the Newman products are supposed to be of higher quality with the excess margin being used to support worthwhile causes and I have no problem with a product such as chocolate where an inflated price provides excess margins to do some good that might otherwise may not have not been done.",4

I tried to improve the taste by adding honey and that helped but not enough for me to be able to drink it.  10 minutes after taking a few sips my tongue was still burning from the spices, not the heat.  More lemon might have helped the flavor a bit but the ginger is quite strong.",2
B007I7Z3Z0,"First I want to say that one packet is way too much for 8oz of water. I used 2 packets with 2-quarts of water and this brings a nice, light flavor that does not taste artificial. Using one packet in a bottle of water would make me choke.<br /><br />Second, don't put these packets into your purse or bag.  The starter cut that allows for easy opening of the package is too deep.  I had taken the box to work with me.  When I realized I needed to mix the powder in greater quantity, I put three packets into my work bag.  Between leaving the office and arriving home (with the majority of the trip the bag sat on the passenger seat of my car), all three were open and I had powder everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the powder does not completely dissolve, even mixing with more water.  It could be that vigorous shaking of the product in a water bottle would help dissolve better than a spoon in a glass pitcher, but I would expect it to eventually dissolve either way, and this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good but only if you dilute it tremendously.  I was reading another review regarding the sweeteners and there are some excellent points to contemplate in that review.  I'm not even going to discuss what is on the label.  I'm just basing my opinion off my direct experience.<br /><br />My rating is a 3-star.  Had I used as directed, it would probably be a 1-star.",3

B001LG945O,"I'm always looking for a carbonated alternative to sodas so I thought I'd give this a try. Generally I enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like La Croix or Crystal Geyser. I also very much enjoy Izzy's sparkling water/juice blends. Unlike Izzy, which combines juice and water, this is a 100% juice beverage that is carbonated. I have to say, it is definitely full of flavor, but it's just too sweet tasting. I like a bit of orange juice now and then, but for this type of carbonated drink, I'm just not into all that sweetness. I tried diluting it with some sparkling water, but the flavor just wasn't quite what I wanted. I like that Izzy is just a bit on the tart side with it's flavors. This is a nice idea and it's pretty ok. I just prefer other beverages over this one.",3

That would have been perfectly acceptable if they had used the money to actually package these properly instead of just make extra money like some infomercial.  The case arrived - all the cones packed in a single plastic bag within 1 box.  This box was in a larger shipping box.  The entire top and bottom rows were cracked to the point of rendering them unusable.  Several along both sides were also damaged.  On top of all that, they have almost no flavor whatsoever, even by wafer cone standards.  If you are looking for good cones, look elsewhere.

As a product I'd order it again.<br /><br />One odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound, but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it.  I didn't weigh the container to confirm this, but if it is 14 ounces, then then they need to update their listing to show such.<br /><br />Since I consider shipping to not be part of a product review I won't lower my star rating for this, and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was SLOW.  I ordered it on June 20th.  A USPS tracking/delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair, but it took until July 5th for me to get this.  Even taking into account that there was a major holiday July 4th, that just seems too slow.  Everything was packaged well enough (although without anything like a ""blue ice"" pack to keep it cold for summer shipping...) but just took a long time to get here.

B002GJ9JWS,"I've always loved peanut butter and have been inclined to mix a spoonful or two into whatever I happen to be eating.  This is a great way to get that wonderful peanut butter taste without the fat, calories, and gloppiness of peanut butter.  The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.  I've tried it reconstituted as well, but I don't think it has quite the same consistency of peanut butter as the real stuff, so I woudn't be inclined to use this like peanut butter in a sandwich or just eat it by the spoonful.  It does impart a nice flavor though, and I don't detect any weird or chemically aroma or flavors -- it's just nice and peanutty.<br /><br />I ordered this and a version of PB2 with chocolate.  PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack.  Frankly, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.

She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it.

Will order this product again",5
B007JFMH96,"This was a nice cookie. The cookies are individually packaged so that you can easily tuck them into a lunchbag or a purse, and the packaging really does hold up well. The cookie itself is slightly on the dry side, but good. For someone looking for a sneaky way to get some extra fiber into my diet and my husband's, this worked really well!",4
B001ET5XWG,"This is the sort of thing that is handy to keep on hand for quickly doctoring up a simple meal.  It's definitely not awesome pesto; think of it more as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup.  What I typically use it for, in that regard, is as a spread on sandwiches, when I'm tired of the usual versions.  It works well in particular on sandwiches featuring cheese or poultry.  It doesn't have much kick on its own as a sauce for pasta; but it can be added to things like frozen pasta dinners or canned soups etc. to give them a little more flavor.<br /><br />One thing I want to mention too is that this product can ""spit"" and spatter when trying to squeeze it out.  When you are ready to open a tube, be sure you pierce the opening fully, so that any chunks within won't get stuck; and keep the bottom of the tube squeezed and rolled up to compact the remainder in the tube as best you can.",3

B000UBDKII,"Senseo is my favorite coffee maker.  Of all the coffee pods I've tried from Senseo and other brands, I keep coming back to Paris.  It is consistently a delight.  I've had trouble finding it in the market because of popularity and now, flavored pods are becoming scarce.  No problem.  I have my subscription to back me up and make it easy.<br /><br />I love coffee, and I do not drink a lot of it.  So I want something that is a delight, and I want to be able to have a supply available so when I run out, I don't have to go on a hunting expedition to get it.  This plan is perfect for that need.  You can skip a shipment if need be, or increase your order.  It is flexible, more cost effect than the stores, and reliable in availability.<br /><br />What more could you want?",5
B001LGGH40,"Like the other flavors of The Switch, Kiwi Berry is sweetened with a mixture of fruit juice concentrates which can lend to it's overly sweet taste. Although this flavor wasn't as sweet as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, for me it wasn't as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Although I can't see buying this drink for myself, my kids do like it.

In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again.

B005K4Q37A,"I found this when I was shopping at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  I do have to say that it does smell good being ""brewed"".  I was very disappointed to find out that it tastes like the crap that you get at a convenient store.  Once you have Real Cappuccino you really can't ever drink that CRAPuccino at convenient stores.  I know I won't ever buy any of their ""cappuccino"" again, but I will give their hot chocolate and apple cider a try in hopes that they are drinkable.",2
B004S0AQHA,"This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is ""definitely a keeper."" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be.",3

B005UP1M4I,"I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time.",1

B0045XE32E,"The amazon description page for this item says most everything you need to know, other than this: will your dog eat them?<br /><br />Dog owners know that each dog is different, some will eat anything you put in front of their face, and some can be VERY finicky. So, I'm not sure how reliable a source I am, because our 15-pound mutt is a little closer to the former category: if it's not bigger than her head, then she'll try to eat it. So, yes, she loves the few of these we've given her so far. They are hard (Milk Bone kind of hard), smallish dry squares that take some effort to break in to small-dog bite-sized pieces, so they test our dog's jaws a little, but her tastebuds don't seem to complain either. Frankly, I like having a treat a dog can't consume in 2 seconds, it's good when she has to work at it a little, both to keep her occupied and to give their teeth and jaws a little workout. Having said that, smaller dogs, weaker-jawed dogs (puppies or the elderly) might not be willing or able to make the effort unless you mash the treat with a hammer or soak it in water or broth for a minute... and why waste your time, just buy a different treat, right?<br /><br />As usual, there's some cute fanciful text on the packaging, and like all Newman's Own products, the net profits go to charity.

Finding vegan convenience foods that are relatively healthy & gluten free is quite the challenge.<br /><br />If you like really spicy food you'll enjoy the heat from the seasonings... but it really lacks flavor. I added some salt, but it's really missing something else. I probably would not purchase this again. If you're accustomed to authentic Indian food you'll be really disappointed.",3

B004ZIER34,"First, I have to confess-I LIKE coffee! However, there are times it simply doesn't like me. That's why I was excited to try the Puroast Low-Acid Coffee-French Roast. Finally, maybe I would find a less-acid-y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to brew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me-and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after-effects like I often do with regular coffee. Puroast upheld the low-acid portion of the bargain admirably . . I just wish they'd have upheld the coffee part as well. I wont be buying this as a coffee substitute; I'll either deal with the acid-and have both the taste and smell of coffee-or do without.",2

B004LSNW34,"I've purchased packs of this gum at my Walgreens a couple times before (largely when it's on sale). I like its taste and how it lasts nearly an hour. It also claims to have a quarter of the recommended B6 and B12 vitamins which is cool (I don't rely on getting my B vitamins from gum, I get them elsewhere). The $14 price sold on here is a little more expensive than the periodic sale of $2.99 for a 3-pack I see at Walgreens. 5 stars for the gum, minus one for the price.<br /><br />For those suffering with acid reflux, try chewing bubble or any fruity gum. When you chew bubble or fruity gum, your mouth generates more saliva offsetting the acid and bile that's been climbing your esophagus. Even though this gum does noticeably tame my acid reflux when I chew it, don't do it like me, with mint gum like this. Mint products only aggravate the symptoms of acid reflux even more. Go for bubble or fruity gum instead. Learned it from Dr. Oz.",4

B004YV80O4,"I'll make this easy:<br /><br />This is a Kraft/Velveeta version of Hamburger Helper. The twist is that this has both a dry seasoning/cheese packet, and a gooey packet of Velveeta cheese product. The latter makes this a bit more cheesy than the Betty Crocker alternatives.<br /><br />Taste-wise, it's okay. I didn't hate it, but I can't see myself craving it, either. The cheese sauce totally overpowered the ground beef's flavor, and the dry packet added a little spicy kick. In the end, I think I could have used tofu or some other nearly-flavorless filler instead of beef, and I'd have been just as happy with the end result.<br /><br />The noodles are big and decent quality. Cooking time is acceptable. The only problem I see is the price; It averages out to about two-fifty per box in US dollars. This is obviously competing with Hamburger Helper, and I can get a box of `Helper for a little over a buck, or less if I get the store brand instead of the Betty Crocker variety. I fail to see how this is worth more than the competition. The cheese sauce packet doesn't make enough of a difference (It's just Velveeta, not real cheese, and I could buy a huge brick of Velveeta and add it to the competition's mix, and still spend less money).<br /><br />If you find it on sale, I'd say go for it. It's good. I just don't think it's ""two dollars and fifty cents per box"" good. I'd pay half that for it. I think Kraft is dreaming when they price a box of noodles, powder, and Velveeta at double what the competition is asking for essentially the same thing.<br /><br />Still, maybe it will make you feel special spending more. That's up to you. The quality is decent. The taste is fine. It's worth a shot if you don't mind the price.",3

B000LRKO9E,"So I bought this pomegranate molasses to make Fattoush, the delicious middle eastern salad of greens, cukes, tomatoes and torn up bits of fried, leftover pita bread.  Wowee, Fattoush is now my favorite salad, I've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon-y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw, youch. I tend to do that, find a food I really like, then eat it so much I almost make myself sick on it.<br /><br />Anyways, the Fattoush salad dressing, with it's complex blend of Sumac, olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses.  I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.<br /><br />Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.<br /><br />Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!

First the UPS guys didnt find the address i wrote which i doubled checked on google and it was correct, then the flowers were sent back to Proflowers because they didnt find the address. It was a complete stress week trying to track with UPS, Proflowers etc where the flowers were.

B0016B7Z32,"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.",2

I suppose if many others are experiencing this same issue, it may be time to choose another coffee provider.<br /><br />March 29 Update: Discovered 8 other faulty cups in this batch - Top seal would come loose while brewing & cause grounds to overflow from top of K-cup, or the internal filter would leak by and puke coffee grounds into my cup.

B003QRGDV4,"If you're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken, this is it. My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost.",4

B001LG945O,"First, I wish I had gotten two can samples of this product so I could try one with some bourbon. I find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice.<br /><br />OK. What I liked: nice fruit flavor. Strong but not overpowering. The carbonation was OK. Not flat, which was nice. Did not tickle my nose as champagne does.<br /><br />I did not care for the ""can"" taste. I felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste. Really, that was the only thing I didn't like. This product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum. Maybe I am overly picky...<br /><br />Overall, not sure I liked it enough to order it again.",3
B002GJ9JWS,"Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away.",1

B001M09BTS,I like this flavor a lot. When I make this I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of regular old fashioned oats. It makes it not quite so sweet and I like the texture of the non-instant oats. I just add water and cook in microwave for 3 minutes. I have no idea what someone said meant about the fake flavoring smell lingering for a week. I didn't have any problem with the smell.,4
B0041NYV8E,This is a good instant all natural beverage.  Good combination of ginger and lemon.  Would be very nice if you weren't feeling well or had a soar throat to have a drink of this beverage.  Smells very nice as well.  I really liked it.,4

B004MO6NI8,"This drink tastes fine as energy drinks go but is really nothing special. Sweetened by high fructose corn syrup, made tart with citric acid, some grape juice concentrate and other flavors added. 87 mg caffeine per serving and two servings per can. The black can with the angry and fractured skull [with wings on it] will appeal to certain people while turning others off. Marketing is everything with energy drinks. There isn't much science to support them beyond the caffeine improving endurance and concentration a bit. Simple coffee may be the better and cheaper choice for those wanting a boost. Many added ingredients are in very low amounts and should have little effect if any. There is a gram of taurine per serving, but the science supporting its use for an energy boost is not at all compelling.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate, Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor, Inositol, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sodium Hexametaphosphate (to Protect Flavor), Caffeine, Monopotassium Phosphate, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate (Preserves Freshness), Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfate, Soy Protein Isolate and Rice Flour, Guarana (Paullinia Caruna), Seed Extract, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Calcium Disodium EDTA (to Protect Flavor), Selenium Complexed with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin.<br /><br />This beverage is a high sugar[260 calories per can] soft drink with a gram of taurine per serving added and perhaps twice the caffeine of the average caffeinated soft drink. It has less caffeine per ounce than brewed coffee. If you like the taste and don't mind paying much more for a few cents worth of caffeine and some other ingredients of questionable value ... enjoy it!  For most people caffeine presents little trouble... used in moderation. But anxiety, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and digestive troubles can follow slamming too much caffeine from any sources... go easy! Peace.",3

With a thin coat of ""You Won't Believe It's Not Butter"" and thin slices of banana, I have a desert or tasty snack; without the banana, I can just eat them as bread, and they are so light and thin with the spread; they are so tasty, and I don't feel guilty after eating them. I can put cooked or raw tomato on them, with a dash of sage & basil to add to the flavor. I have successfully kept my blood sugar normal consistently with diet control.

For those concerned about taste, I would say this is a great product and if rating on taste alone I would give this ""Back to Nature"" product 5 Stars.  However, once again we have a product that ""looks"" seemingly healthy and fun, but is loaded with added carbohydrates, aka ""sugar"" and that is what brings the score on this product down.  You think companies would work with today;s busy professionals and re-establish trust, by offering products that are truly truly healthy and not just slipping them in under the FDA or surgeon general guide lines of what is deemed good health or nutrition.  I am  very health conscious so always reading labels for ingredients.  Furthermore I have to keep my sugar intake in check during this ""look better naked"" summer months.  Great treat, but for those looking to shed the extra pounds of fat or get leaner during the summer save this for the winter months or during your bulking phase.",3

So, I was very pleased that Amazon offers this, since it is getting harder and harder to find in the Seattle area. I do most of my grocery shopping on-line at Safeway, and they don't offer it or any Suger-Free Kool-Aid flavors. I think the price is a little high, but I ordered it on sale and also subscribed to have it delivered bi-monthly, so the price is more reasonable. I also purchased the grape flavor, but Tropical Punch is still my favorite. Next time I will get the Cherry flavor, because I like it mixed with Crystal Lite lemonade! It disolves very well in cold water, and to me does not taste sugar-free at all.  And of course it is even more refreshing and delicious served up in my vintage 1960's Kool-Aid pitcher and little Kool-Aid cup!!!",5

However the product is very inconsistent.  Sometime I get wonderful rich thick coconut milk and other times its watery, curdled, and gritty.  The watery stuff does not do well in my recipes at all.  I saw other reviewers said it has to do with whether the cans came from Sri Lanka or Thailand.  I will not be ordering these from amazon.  Even though it is more expensive at the store, I want to be able to make sure I'm getting the thick coconut milk.  It's really unacceptable that two completely different products are being sold as the same product.",2

This tea has flavor, but its delicate,<br />and certainly wont brew any dark colored cupa tea, NO WAY JOSE ! can it be considered a good morning wake up tea? only by those that have NEVER had a strong cup of tea...caffeine content is weak, but it does works well as a good cheep base for afternoon tea when mixed with flavored green ( citrus, berry etc )Caffine cravers wont get any more kick from this than a green tea, and it wont satisfy anyone looking for a "" robust, strong, flavorful, malty, aromatic, etc "" like all the other reviewers have listed....only thing i can say is either they got another tea than i did, OR they are just plain NUTZ, and/or work for DILMAH",3

This tea does not have that quality. Rather than whole leaves, the tea is ground-up bits like in English breakfast tea. Even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks. Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer! If you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable, but why bother when you can do better with a bag? I won't be buying this again.",2

Overall, I immensely enjoyed the honey and pomegranate flavoring. It can be a tad sweet but you can always add water or use less mix to compensate. The only concern is the time it takes for the mix to dissolve. Many other mixes are able to dissolve almost instantly; however, with Lipton's, you've got to shake the drink for at least a good five minutes before the mix clumps completely breakdown otherwise you'll be feeling granules of mix grating in your mouth.

A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C.  To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.<br /><br />If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend Acai Lemonade by NOW Foods.

One is the White Meat and Chicken by Pro Plan.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODAS9M"">Pro Plan White Meat Chicken & Vegetable Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a> The second is Salmon and Chicken by Tiki<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AN8JDK"">Tiki Cat Consomme, 8-Pack, 6-Ounce Can, Napili Luau Wild Salmon and Chicken in Chicken</a>The Third is Tilapia by Fancy Feast.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY"">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />So of all the cat foods I buy, only four are always eaten, by everyone, all the time and Grammys pot pie is one of them. SO the kitters have asked me to try some other flavor by Merrick. I will try, for their sake...for them anything...but I doubt a raging success. Some things always look great at the start, but then do not make it to the ""all the time, every time, every one"" category.<br /><br />But, my guys give this 5 stars and say ""thank you"" for reading what we think: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty. It is a 5 star meal for us and we think your kids will like it also, so give it a try...""you know, for their sake, or however she says that."" ""We agree on this Merrick!!!""",5

B00141UC9I,"My dog loves these treats and I have been buying them from Target. Found them @ Amazon in bulk and for a much lower per pack price. I got my father's dog hooked on these, too. Now he buys them from Amazon!",4
B005CUU25G,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.",2
B000CDNL8I,"First: we are talking about a shaker of actual gold flakes. Anything negative probably falls into the category of, ""Seriously? You just bought a shaker of GOLD FLAKES."" That being said, the shaker itself could be better; the flakes come out all right and not too clumpy, which is good--I'm using these for a specialty cocktail--but I have a feeling about 30% of the gold I just paid an outrageous sum for is going to end up stuck to the sides of the shaker with no way to extract.<br /><br />Also. I know it's real gold, but this price is just silly. I can't use the candy gold flakes for my purpose so I'm stuck with these guys, and I do appreciate they make a hard to find product, but their margin must be astronomical.",3
B0049ULB78,"Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count ""value"" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.",3
B000KAJ51U,"This product, I love !!  However, the product pictured on Amazon showed a package of 12 Large Greenies for $14.99 and what arrived was a package of 8.

B0035C94E8,"I love Cherimoyas. The flavor, the taste, what's not to like. These ones were not the best, though. They never got sweet and flavorful the way Cherimoyas do. Even after turning brown on the outside.<br /><br />They were exceptionally well packaged, but a waste of money",1
B002DHTWNO,"I am so disappointed. I also had the mold issue a lot of reviews were talking about. Since I paid for it I found a piece that wasn't touching the mold and tried it. I'm daring I know. The beef jerky was very tender. I know some might like that, but I like it a little rough. That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this brand again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky.",1

B007ZTL8Z0,"This is good stuff, and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa. One store carries it at times but runs out and at times I send for it through Amazon.com. The price in the stores can be very expensive, and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at Amazon adds to the price. I won't discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost . My dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so I pay what I pay.",4

Having traveled in Asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete, nothing I found in the store came close... until I found Taste Nirvana.

B008FXKOI2,"Though my cat is a huge a fan of all of the Dental Chews produced by greenies, my experience with this product was less than pleasant.<br />This product did the opposite of what it set out to do.  My cat violently vomited hairballs the same evening I fed him these.  In fact, he couldn't digest them at all and has never thrown up so much at one time.  This was unusual and still has me shocked, especially for an animal that regurgitates seldom and mildly.  Be careful, as I wish I had.",1
B00503DP0O,"There are many other reviews that go into great detail regarding calories, ingredients etc.  I will not repeat that info here, but will limit my comments to taste/value/""worth it"" factor.<br />I thought these tasted just ok.  They would never be my first or second tier pick for a snack.  They are too small for meal substitute and contain too many calories for a snack for anyone watching weight.  I found the mouth feel of these to be unpleasant.  The taste is ok...none of the individual ingredients shine.<br />p.s. Someone with a chip on their shoulder has gone through the reviews for this product and given almost everyone of them an unhelpful feedback--and this includes a huge variety of detailed reviews.  I like to believe this is not someone from Pamelas as they are a good and reputable copany.  But, in all my reviews and looking at other reviews I rarely see this happen...weird...and if this person has the energy I feel sure tney will slam this one also.",3
B000EHP62Q,"This oatmeal is another good Kashi product, but don't expect a terribly flavorful cereal.

B003ZNRDPE,"I ordered what I thought was five ""4"" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five ""single"" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.",1

I used to buy it in the powdered, but then the liquid came out and we used that.  Then now they have this concentrated creamer which is the best yet, we beleive it tastes better than the liquid and the powdered.  Also, it gives you more for your dollar.  The only downside is the pump.  Really cool idea if you could only remove it after putting it on.  I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.  We leave it off and just pour it into the coffee, and when there is only a little left, we pour some coffee in it and get the rest out.  Also another plus, the container is recyclable in a lot of areas.  Go CoffeeMate!",4

I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip!

B000KAJ51U,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.",1
B0045XE32E,"I opened the packages, and pulled out one of the biscuits.  They are shaped as two pieces that can easily be broken in half.  Each 1/2 piece is a bit large for training, I would prefer smaller bits, but the 1/2 piece makes a nice mouthful for a medium sized dog (45 lb).  The biscuits are a rather drab brown, a simple rectangular shape, very utilitarian, favoring function over form.<br /><br />Now the real test.  I gave one to my dog.  She was hesitant at first, but gave in and attacked the treat with gusto.  Her normal behavior for getting a treat is to sit.  Once she finished the first treat, she got into the sit position, and stared intently at me and the bag, eager to earn another.  I gave her a second, and it was gone in moments.  I then placed her regular treat (a Milkbone) 2 feet apart from one of these treat, made the dog wait for 15 seconds.  When I let her go, she went first for the Newman treat.  Once gone, she went just a quickly to the Milkbone.  Hardly a scientific test, but interesting all the same.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the item says it's a 6-pack of treats, but I received only a single bag of treats.  For the price, this is in no way worth it for a single bag.  For 6 bags, however, this would be competitive with ""name brand"" snacks, and the ingredients list would cause me to choose this first.",4
B00061NJ06,"My husband and I took a vacation to Costa Rica and had a wonderful time.  The whole time we were there we drank there Britt Dark Roast and loved the taste.

B003QNJYXM,"I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery.

Think of it as orange soda without all the things you don't want. Switch has just the right amount of carbonation to make the beverage refreshing without being filling.<br /><br />It's a zippy beverage made with real tangerine, apple, and grape juices, and would make a refreshing beverage, lunch, dinner, or snack-time drink.<br /><br />There was a slight aftertaste that I'm chalking up to either the can or the citrus, but it didn't get in the way of enjoying the drink.<br /><br />Make the ""switch"" to Switch.",3

B001CD1VI4,"I was so excited to try these.  I am trying to find economical GOOD for you food.  I ate one of these and a cup of Joe and I was full. Delicious!  Heated it 20 seconds. That of course is unfrozen.  I immediately froze the rest to keep them fresh as no preservatives in them. I think you have to heat it about 40 seconds when frozen.  My son had one (He is 21) and he had to have two to fill him.  He likes them a lot. My Mom had one and she was full.  She could not quit talking about how good they are. Another reason  I also wanted to try these is because my Mom has Alzheimers and cannot cook on stove safely anymore. She likes to snack and get things herself so these are perfect.  She can still use the microwave. I feel these are healthy eating and that makes me feel good. We all have medical disabilities so the easier the better. The really cool part is that they are just a little over a 1.00 each for breakfast! We love the Morning Glory and am fixing to order more with Amazon Prime. By the way for those of you who don't know about Prime, it is wonderful and we have saved so much on shipping this year. Also, it is quick 2 day free shipping and 3,95 for overnight.  I try to only buy products that have Prime on them. Our cookies came today (a Saturday) with Prime 2 day by Fed Ex. That is another thing I love is shipping is free with Prime on these. If you shop  a lot on Amazon (which I am doing more and more) the 70.00 is a great value for a years membership. Gotta order more cookies now! Blessings!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/7/10:  I HAVE READ COMMENTS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD THESE GET MOULD ON THEM. PLEASE REMEMBER TO FREEZE THESE AS THEY HAVE NO PRESERVATIVES.  THERE IS A NOTE  ON WHITE PAPER FROM ERIN BAKER IN EACH PACKAGE WHICH SUGGESTS  YOU DO THIS AND WHY.  JUST HATE TO SEE ERIN GET BASHED FOR THIS WHEN IT IS NOT HER FAULT. MINE GO IN THE FREEZER AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE. THAT WAY THEY ARE ALWAYS FRESH.

GREAT BARGAIN FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO WATCH OUR PENNIES.<br /><br />MY MOM (who has alzheimers) LOVES THEM SO MUCH I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I QUIT ORDERING THEM. SHE TALKS ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME . SHE WAS FEELING SO DOWN AS SHE CANNOT COOK MUCH AT ALL ANYMORE AND  SINCE THESE THEY ARE EASY FOR HER TO HEAT IN THE MICROWAVE, IT MAKES HER FEEL BETTER ABOUT HERSELF. THANK YOU ERIN!",5
B001HTJ2BQ,"This is a great product at a very good price. Delivery time was good, but a quarter of the cans had large dents in them, another quarter had small dents and only half of the cans (6) had no dents at all. So far, the dented cans I opened did not seem to suffer any quality loss, but I would feel a lot better if all the cans were dent-free. According to USDA Food Safety guidelines, there is always a danger that deep dents may have sharp points which allow bacteria to enter the can, and hence contaminating the food in the can.<br /><br />I would give a 5 star rating if all the cans were dent-free.",3
B000CQBZOW,"I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.",2

B0058AMY74,These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.,4

B003VXFK44,"This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",4
B007TJGZ5E,"Green Mountain's Nantucket blend is a great cup of coffee for almost any occasion. It can be your morning coffee, your afternoon wake-up, or even your after dinner brew. It has a medium body with a smooth flavor. I don't care for dark roasts but I also wanted something that packed more of a punch than a light roast; the Nantucket blend definitely fits the bill.<br /><br />My only complaint about this coffee is that it does have a stronger aftertaste than I would like. I enjoy drinking the coffee but I am sometimes left with a bitter taste in my mouth.",4

They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil.",1

I suppose some reviewers actually liked this, but I have to say without any doubt whatsoever, this is absolutely the WORST jerky I've ever tried.  I've grown up on the stuff, and I like a real cowboy beef jerky.  This stuff is soft, kind of falls apart in your mouth, and I'm sorry just plain TERRIBLE.

He 48 lbs, gets his regular meals in it and finishes in about 15 minutes.  I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!  Worked great for the second dog for a few weeks, he wasn't as good at it, so it took him a bit longer to empty it so we thought it might be perfect for him.  We were wrong, he chewed the rope in half one day.  :-(  Third dog is just kind of dumb and just smells it and looks at it.  The plastic is really rugged though, they're able to toss it around on stained concrete floors without breaking it!<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this company's toys.

B002IEZJMA,"This was a really unsatisfactory beverage in taste and aftereffects. I'm not a huge fan of coffee in a can or jar, having partaken of two widely nationally available brands and found them lacking for a coffee fanatic such as myself (consuming an average of 4-6 cups a day). I was hoping that the Italians (via Denmark, where this product is made) would get it right. Sadly, the Illy Espresso company has failed abysmally with this product. The weird thing was that it tasted fine for the first sip: a nice, bracing bittersweet espresso flavor. The second sip, it seemed a little tinny. Then it was salty. But I was committed to finishing this drink to the full, 6.8 fluid ounce end. The bitter end. Because while I got a faint coffee buzz, I also got major heartburn and a stomachache within a half hour of consumption. I'm guessing as an amateur chemist that adding baking soda (potassium bicarbonate, 20 mg sodium per serving in the drink) with an alkaline Ph interacts negatively with coffee's more acid Ph.  Well, I've popped an antacid, and I will say that this product has convinced me that there are no shortcuts in life. If you want decent coffee, make it yourself. This product contains 156 mg of caffeine per serving. If that's what you're looking for, there are other options that won't feel like you drank battery acid.",1
B001II47PW,"I heard about this salt on a forum a while back.  Many people said it was the real thing.  So I ordered it from Amazon.  It was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy.  I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta.  The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing.  I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer.  That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food.  What a disappointment !  It tastes like salt and MSG with yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience.  I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste.  Just salt and MSG...",2
B001EQ55RW,"I really thought I would love these.  I like all kinds of nuts, roasted and otherwise.  I like all kinds of chocolate, really like dark chocolate.  Heck, I even love mocha roast coffees and dark beers described as nutty. But I don't love this product.  Maybe it's just me.  I understand it's not cocoa in the sense of a creamy coating, but rather it's a dry dusting that is not unhealthy.  I understand it's dark cocoa.  But I didn't like the taste.

B002QTWTA2,"These are extremely yummy fruit snacks! I am always on a quest to find organic, easy, yummy foods for our busy family. I was excited to find these and quickly bought a box, I've been impressed with all the Annie's products I have bought. They didn't disappoint in the taste department, but.... I am a little disappointed about the ingredients in these.<br /><br />Ingredient #1: Organic Tapioca Syrup-this appears to be a great alternative to high fructose corn syrup and other sugary additives. Here's what I pulled up about this ingredient-"" Tapioca syrup provides the sweetness needed in a natural way. Produced from tapioca starch using a natural fermentation process, tapioca syrup is a gluten-free and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) alternative to corn syrup, sugar, honey, maple syrup and molasses.""  [...]<br /><br />Ingredient #2: Organic cane sugar-this is just sugar. It's organic, so it wasn't grown using pesticides or anything, but sugar is sugar and I try to limit it as much as possible. I'm bummed that this is the 2nd ingredient.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredients aren't really a big deal to me, but here they are: organic tapioca solids, organic white grape juice concentrate, pectin, citric acid, ascorbic acid, colors (tumeric, black carrot juice concentrate, annatto), natural flavors, sodium citrate, organic sunflower oil, and carnauba wax (from palm leaves)<br /><br />So why am I let down by this product? There are tons of great tasting fruit snacks out there that don't use any extra sugar to sweeten them. Stretch Island Origional Fruit Leathers don't use any extra sugars, here's the ingredients of their summer strawberry fruit leather- ""Apple Puree Concentrate, Pear Puree Concentrate, Strawberry Puree, Organic Natural Strawberry Flavor, Lemon Juice Concentrate. All Sugars Are Found Naturally In The Fruit."" Clif sells their Twisted Fruit rope that has no added sugar. Archer Farms sells a fruit snack for a great price that has no added sugar.<br /><br />So the Annie's Organic Fruit snacks are a great tasting snack that is far above those icky artificial brands that are loaded with artificial dye's and sugar, but I still think there's some room for improvement by using only fruit to sweeten it, rather than cane sugar.",3
B0014WYXQK,"INITIAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I like the idea of creating a drink that is true to the fruit's taste.  If you ate a fresh fruit, you would have an idea of what IZZE drinks would taste like.  This is a good thing, of course.  But in order to appreciate the drink, you will have to re-orient your taste if you've been drinking the over-sweetened fruit drinks.<br /><br />In a market saturated with energy drinks full of caffeine and artificial sweeteners, the company chose to go the other way to create a naturally sweet drink with no refined sugars, no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />For 2008 the company, which is now under PepsiCo, introduces the IZZE Fortified which contains 10% of the USRDA Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  And this is what is being reviewed.<br /><br />I don't know if this the fortification will make a dent towards a healthier drink compared with other fortified drinks in the market.  I guess if you couple this with the fact that it contains 70% fruit juice and is low in sodium then people who are looking for something else other than water will perhaps have a reason to want to drink this than go the soda route.<br /><br />The remaining 30% is seltzer water which can be a good alternative and a great way for adults and children to slowly steer away from the usual carbonated drinks.  Although with Pepsi at the marketing wheel, it is interesting to see how they position this product with the rest of their soda line up.  (They did say they will leave the product alone, but this is a relatively young acquisition so let's not think for a moment that the product has settled in already when it's actually just beginning.)<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />They have geared the drink toward a more natural taste.  So if you are used to sweetened juices, be wary and try a single sample of each flavors than a whole bulk at once.  Because the pomegranate taste you may come to know may not actually be the same taste you expect with this product.  This company is not shy in making you taste the tartness or sourness when present in a fruit.<br /><br />To compare my taste buds with others, I made my colleagues try the ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" and I got adverse reactions on the flavor.  The thing is these are people who are soda drinkers.  So they may not be the correct target market for this kinds of healthy-tasting drinks.  But then again the manufacturers need to lure these people as well if they want to expand their market.<br /><br />That's why it's interesting to see how PepsiCo will market this product in full force and convince the general soda drinkers to appreciate the taste.<br /><br />Although for a product that tries to stick to the natural fruit taste, it would be perplexing to me when the first ingredient found in a drink called ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" would be ""pure juice made from Apple""...which goes on to list in this order ""White Grape. Clarified Pineapple, Lemon, Cranberry and Pomegranate.""  Finally, Pomegranate is mentioned albeit at the end!<br /><br />SIZE:<br /><br />8.4 FL OZ is too little these days.  Although consuming this liquid in sparkling form will help you drink more slowly than if it were in the usual flat juice experience.<br /><br />I guess it's perfect for children since they are starting to sell this in schools as well.  But what about adults who have been trained to take on big drinks.  The size may be perfect if used alongside their meal, but what about in between meals?  I guess it's about time we are redirected in our thinking that if we are thirsty, then we drink water.  Unlike other products that advertises in quenching your thirst, this is not where it's heading.<br /><br />SO WHERE IS THIS PRODUCT HEADING?<br /><br />I can only surmise with the acquired taste and small size of this product, it will remain a niche product in a campaign toward healthier consumption.  In fact part of the image is being involved in a charity program that centers on needy children around the world.<br /><br />I would love to have them exist for a good cause, but I honestly won't go out and buy a product and force myself to like the taste so I can help educate the children.  If I wanted to do that then I'll simply find a non-profit organization that prides itself in maximizing contributions toward going to children than towards the running cost.<br /><br />In any case, I am not faulting the product for anything.  It's a product that certainly appeals to me and hopefully others who want a healthier option and know that water is their main source in quenching their daily thirst, but want something exciting in between.<br /><br />So three (3) starts because it's not a revolutionary product at this day and age, but at least it's something to consider.",3

B000VK8HCW,"I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.

I can't see putting this on a bagel---too bland---and it's just sweet enough that you wouldn't use it in savory dishes.<br /><br />Let's say you *did* want to put it on a bagel.

B008C2JCUW,"I used this once. It works.  My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer.  My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent.",2

B001CGTN1I,"I started adding chia seeds to my diet about 18 months ago.  I have tried various brands and like the Navitas Naturals brand the best of the 4 or 5 brands I have tried.  Not sure if the ""organic"" promises they provide are absolutely true, but as a consumer of several Navitas Naturals products I certainly hope so.  In any event, it beats buying some of the bulk chia seeds I have found at local stores with little or no explanation of where the seeds really come from.<br /><br />In all, I find chia seeds rather tasteless.  The joy in eating them, if there is any, is in the texture / crunch they provide.  Some other brands had what I assume was foreign matter, which made the texture uneven or, worse, hard like having little rocks in the mix.<br /><br />My motivation for adding them to my diet was to increase my Omega 3 intake from plant sources and add more fiber as well.  I have noticed improvement in my overall health since eating them, but I can't say for sure if chia played any role in that because I changed my diet in many other ways and greatly increased my work out schedule.  Just to be safe, I'm going to continue eating chia every morning and adding it as often as possible for other meals throughout the day.<br /><br />As a very happy customer, I plan on continuing my subscription to Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds for a long time.",5

After checking the list of ingredients on the website and the product package, there is no mention of raisins. Putting all of that aside, I think this product would be tasty to those of you who like raisins.

While not quite the same it is close.<br /><br />To fix you use a finely chopped (finer the better) onion that is sauteed till cooked, then add your meat (I use chicken) till browned, then throw in water and cream and let simmer. Serve over rice.<br /><br />The first batch I made was a tad on the watery side, I had used a knife to chop the onions and powdered coconut milk for the cream. I thought it was ok but the rest of the family loved it.<br /><br />Understanding the dish a bit better the second time around I used the food processor for the onion, this gave a more even smooth paste like base. Then I used coconut cream on a 1:1 basis for water. That turned out MUCH thicker and tastier. Everyone in the house loves it, personally I'd prefer a bit more punch but if your looking for something with good flavor and no heat this is an excellent choice. I will be stocking up on it.",4

I usually add some Trader Joe's vanilla protein powder to add some nutritional weight to them. You could also toss in some chocolate chunks for a treat.<br /><br />I don't know what's up with the ""charging for flavor"" review. That's not really a review of the product but rather a review of the price. Anyway, this is a good value.",3
B001EO5ZFQ,"(First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay any<br />attention to those NO votes, they both arrived within minutes of posting this review.)<br /><br />This sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is NOT jerk sauce, doesnt even remotely<br />resemble a bad facsimile. I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuff<br />is horrible.<br /><br />BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets.",1
B001HTJ2BQ,"This product was horrible.  The very first can I opened was dented, so I checked the other cans in the case, and - with the exception of one can - they were all in the same shape.  I figured I could overlook that, but the can I was holding felt heavy, which was weird, so I opened it.  Totally solid, except for a small amount of coconut water (not milk!) at the bottom - which I only discovered after I scooped out the rest of the product.  Since I use this product to make Green Smoothie Girl's Hot Pink Breakfast Smoothie, I figured I could still use the solid mass (I blend in a BlendTec, which can handle it).  WRONG.  It made our smoothies totally grainy and flat out horrible.  We've been drinking these smoothies for about 6 months now, and really truly like them, but a smoothie made with this product?  Gross.  Totally different.  We gave it a shot, though, and continued using the product for about 2 weeks.  We use 1 can every morning in our smoothies, and each and every smoothie was exactly the same texture: grainy and almost mottled with this coconut milk.  Yuck.  Since I had signed up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, I knew I had to cancel my order (2 cases every month) soon, but Amazon was really on top of things and I received my next order over a week early!  Now I had 3 cases of product I didn't want.  Stellar.  Luckily, after an email to Amazon over the fact that I can't return this product because it's a grocery item, they refunded my account and all is well again - plus, I remembered to cancel my subscription to this item, so I'm in no danger of ending up with another two cases!",1
B001EQ5IPQ,Best coconut water I've tasted - and I've tried plenty of other brands! It's a must buy if you like coconut water!,5
B000G0EP78,"I've only used this product to make pancakes so far, but so far, so good.  Except of course for the first attempt.  When I mixed the batter according to the package directions, it appeared WAAAY too thick to possibly make pancakes.  Sooooo... I added and added and added liquid until it seemed like pancake consistency.  DO NOT DO THIS!  That first batch, although the crumbs tasted just fine, didn't hold together, couldn't be flipped without the entire thing falling apart, and frankly made a huge mess.  Entirely my fault, admittedly.  I plan to try using it for pizza dough and deep-fry coating soon.",4

B0002NVKWC,"I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didn't pay full price.<br /><br />I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.<br /><br />I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.<br /><br />In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.",2

B007POT6RM,"I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience.",3
B000P566K8,"First of all, when I purchased this product it was listed as two 3-packs for the price.  I only received one 3-pack.  Amazon kindly refunded half of my money, but note that I would not have purchased the product at the current offer of one 3-pack for the same price.<br /><br />Black sugar is reputed to be eaten in Japan as a candy.  This black sugar tastes very nice that way, a bit like the penuche that I made as a child that didn't get cooked long enough and was partially crystallized when it cooled.  Add molasses taste to that, and I think that is pretty close.<br /><br />This black sugar is not uniformally dark throughout.  When you break the brick, in cross-section it is only dark for about one quarter of the way in from the surface top and bottom, and the same absolute distance on the sides.  The inner one-half is the color of light brown sugar.  I don't know what to make of that.  I don't know if it is normal for black sugar to be light brown inside.  Presumably the darkness is from the molasses, but I don't know why the molasses would look like it had soaked in from the outside instead of being uniformally distributed in the sugar brick.  The dark brown raw sugar from Africa, that I also bought, is uniformally dark but not as dark as the outside of this black sugar brick.  I imagine that if I pulverized the inner and outer sections of this Okinawa black sugar together I might get the same color as the dark brown sugar from Africa.  I haven't tried the experiment because the black sugar brick is not easily pulverized, although it is not too hard to bite.<br /><br />In summary, the taste is quite nice but I'm not at all sure that it is novel enough for the price I paid, let alone twice that much.  However, it is a taste of food from a place that I have never been and never will go, so I gave it four stars.",4
B000GKTNXE,"My order was cancelled 4 days after placing it. I received no explanation or advanced notice. I will think twice before purchasing from Godiva again, which I previously did a lot over the holidays.",1
B000H2405M,"Based on the reviews I read here I was looking forward to writing my own positive review, but I made two batches in accordance with the instructions on the bag and the flavor was mediocore at best.  I did not care much for the rice in the chili either and talk about some serious flatulence! I'm just saying!  I have made my chili homemade for a number of years so in all fairness perhaps I was expecting too much from a pre-mix 25 minute chili but even after 6 hours no big flavor imporvements.  I won't be making another purchase.  I'll give the remaining bags to someone in my neighborhood who wants or is willing to try this product.",2
B003R0LKSG,"I'd been feeding them Wellness until the recent recall. After checking some reviews, I looked around for something comparably healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot. They're always enthusiastic at mealtimes, but they've been literally climbing over each other at mealtimes for this. One caveat: Unlike the Wellness it has a pull tab, which is good news/ bad news. No need to mess with a can opener, but it's absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess.",5

B0081XIA1E,"My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product. (yes I'm a worry wart pet parent, but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into...)",2
B001ULH7P4,It is a product of China. If I had known I would not have ordered it. For those of you that share my concerns you will find the information useful. As for the rest of you - ignore this review - or - do some research on the safety of what is comeing out of China.,1
B001BDDTB2,"I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.<br />They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food<br /><br />I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.<br /><br />Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product.",3

I didn't hate it and drank half of the 24 count box but donated the rest to the stash at work.

Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!

Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple.

If you like sugary cereals, you'll probably enjoy this more than we did.  There are 23 g of carbs per 3/4 cup and 10g of sugars.

B0081XIA1E,"I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!",4

We made orange juice and ordered a citrus juicing attachment for our Kitchenaid because that many oranges was a lot of work!

It contains much more pith (the white layer under the zest) than ours did, as we were careful to follow Pepin's instructions given in ""La Method"". As a result of the higher percentage of pith, the candied peel was much more bland than our home candied peel, and less vibrant in color.<br />We concluded that candying peel at home makes much more sense that buying candied peel.

The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one.

B001ACNWY8,"I not only have non-celiac gluten intolerance, but anaphylaxis to corn, so I use this mix primarily for tortillas.  I figured out that Chebe had changed it's formula when trying to make them one day.  I followed the package directions as usual, & got a gooey, sticky mess that would not roll out into tortillas.  Then next time I made tortillas I used 2 TBLS water (1/2 the amount called for), 2 TBLS olive oil & 1 egg & omitted the cheese.  This mixture seems a little dry, but once kneaded it works perfectly!  As one reviewer said, Chebe is changing back to the original formula & if it were unchanged, I would have given the mix 5 stars.  My 6 year old is also gluten intolerant & allergic to corn & he loves these topped with cheese to make cheese crisps.  Fry the dough & you have a great base for Navajo tacos or tostados!",4

B006DQZ064,"I bought a package of these when they first came out.  My initial reaction was the price difference did not justify purchasing these.  The capsules work well.  The flavor of the coffee is good but, there is not as much creama as the Nespresso capsules.  With the new lower prices, these are a good alternative to Nespresso, but they are a compromise.  If you want the best flavor and creama, stick with Nespresso but, if you want a cheaper, almost as good altrnative, give them a try.  I really wish they would package several varieties in one ""intoductory"" package so I could try five varieties without having to buy five fifferent five packs of the same variety.  The descriptions don't give much of a clue as to how the coffe will taste and how strong it is.  If you purchase a five pack and aren't fond of the flavor or intensity, you have a lot of coffee you may not like.  I may try these again although, for now, I'm going to stay with the tried and true (and expensive) Nespresso brand.  Maybe the competition will slow down the frequent price increases from Nespresso.<br />UPDATE:  Prices have come down dramatically on these.  Still not as good as Nespresso originals, but Nespresso's customer service stinks so bad and their prices so high, I'm done buying from them.  These are close and environmentally much friendlier.",3

These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan.

But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.

B000GZW8F4,"I've had these a number of times and my most recent attempt was an utter and complete failure. The amount of water recommended wasn't enough to hold my falafel balls together and they came out dry. I suspect this is why they fell apart in the oil. Also half an inch of oil in the pan is really insufficient if you want to make normal sized falafel balls. Even at one inch in diameter you would have to flip them over to cook both sides of the ball. This also results in a partially cooked interior.<br /><br />Taste wise these are rather unspectacular. Any half decent restaurant falafel will be better than these. But then again what do you expect for something that comes in a powder form.<br /><br />I say try making your own from scratch. It's not easy to find a perfect mixture that won't disintegrate, but when they are good they are divine.<br /><br />In the meantime I'll continue looking for another prepackaged falafel option.",2

The 3 oz packet produces a very strong pot of coffee, and therefore some folks may want to experiment with using a partial packet to brew the perfect pot.  But the coffee had a full-bodied flavor and did not leave any bitter aftertaste.  I would compare the taste to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0TW"">Melitta European Roast Extra Dark Ground Coffee, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />The problem is that while the coffee itself is good, it is rather overpriced.  As it stands, you are looking at spending over $2 a pot if you buy the ten-pack.  Particularly in light of the fact that some folks will waste a pack or two trying to adjust to suit their tastes.  I can buy four or five full size cans of the Melitta coffee for the price of this brand.  Because of the price, the coffee is not a good value for your buck.",3

B004SRH2B6,"Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by ""Todd O'Connor"" and under Alio ""Alio""s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio ""Alio"" confirming the fake identity.)",1

B0041NYV8E,"First, the packaging.  What exactly is a ""gold kili.""  I was hoping it would be some kind of mythical Asian flower or something interesting, but no.  My quick look-see around the Interweb revealed only that it's the name of this Singapore-based ongoing business concern, involved with TastyÂ® Singapore, which is an initiative of the government-sponsored International Enterprise Singapore, an effort to promote Singaporean food businesses worldwide (which has a very colorful and very loud website).  And Tasty has got a nice, smiley kind of logo, too (see image).<br /><br />If the good folks at Gold Kili want this and their other products to take off in the US, they really need to work on their packaging.  The copy on the envelope is not very good, a bit awkward, coming off as having been developed by someone whose first language is not English (like Singapore Chinese).  The instructions open with ""For hot serving...""  Well, I figure that has to do with heated water, but the 8th grader in me also instantly recognized a distinct yet seriously divergent possible type of serving method.  But I digress.  Knowing most Americans, the preparation text needs to be much more clear, with very concrete instructions, like starting with, ""Pour contents into a cup...""  Second, the only measure of how much water to use is in metric.  I'm down with the metric, yo, but most Americans are most definitely not, so you've got to actually tell them to put 8 Â½ ounces into their coffee mug.<br /><br />Note that 8.5 ounces really isn't that much.  It's more or less a standard coffee cup, but in bigger-is-better America, that's only half a mug.  I recommend Gold Kili up-size their portions for the US market.<br /><br />Man, that ginger scent--strong--comes barreling right out right away when you open the envelope, and then when you stir it up, a very distinctive aroma.  The scent is quite good, a very nice alternative to coffee; brewing up a lot of this would be a very nice aroma throughout the house.  And so how did it taste?  Well, it was sweeter than I expected, which was a relief.  That unmistakable ginger taste is really strong, that pungent, stinging taste, spicy and quite insistent.  If you've had Asian ginger candy and can take it and like it, this product will work for you.  I do think that most Americans will not take to this, as it is a most definitely foreign and highly specialized ethnic taste, something they've only gotten the slightest hint of at their local bland Zap Wok restaurant.  The lemon flavor is there, albeit rather subtle.  You get the lemon mostly in the aftertaste.  You do get a very distinct and lingering ginger aftertaste of the drink, and that unmistakable low-level burn of ginger at the back of your throat.  It stays with you for some time, even after drinking or eating something else.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty good hot, but is NOT good cold.  For testing purposes, I added nothing to the drink, no sugar, nothing additional; I think doing so would ruin it.<br /><br />My experience with the drink's color was not what you see on the package, which appears to be a kind of semi-clear green tea.  It is very unclear if this is in fact some kind of tea.  All the envelope tells you is that it's ginger lemon drink, and that's all.  There's no more info on the packaging.  The actual color is a kind of ruddy brown, much like a tea.<br /><br />And hey, in the grandest tradition of Indians, Chinese and Malays (and generations of colonial descendants) living so peaceably together in lovely, sterile, boring yet successful Singapore, this product is in fact halal.  Yay.  There are no kosher markings.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you've spent time in Asia, and are up for something more than the ubiquitous, overpriced fare at Starbucks, this one will work for you as a morning drink.  For those not used to full-on ginger, this make take some adjustment.  The ginger taste is powerful, so is a good pick-up, although this product is caffeine-free.  It'll be a welcome product for Asians and those used to strong ginger products, but will take some getting used to for most Westerners.",4

B001RVFDOO,"I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online.",5
B004SRH2B6,"Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting ""it"" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on ""coconut water laxative"" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you ""run"", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p",1

B000UOFW9K,"LOVE these chips.  I think there are so many GF baked goods (be they less than exciting rice chips, heavy breads, grainy cakes, etc.) that just fall short of taste and texture.  I am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are!  They are much like a popular orange triangular chip but better, even ""fresher"" tasting.  If I don't take a serving and put the bag away first, I'm very likely to mow through it in one sitting.  Products like these make me feel like I'm not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going GF.",5

B001RVFDOO,"To those of you, and there's a lot of us, who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intake,these chips are A-1 in my book.<br /><br />First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.<br /><br />I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.<br /><br />They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.<br /><br />So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1 - 2 bags a day!!!<br /><br />They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.<br /><br />So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends/family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.<br /><br />Hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackers!!!!!<br /><br />Keep on Munching, the Healthy way with ""POPCHIPS"" snacks.",5
B000EVMNNC,"I completely liked these things --- BEFORE I got the gigantic 5lb bag. I'd actually prefer to keep them as a treat rather than something to just get sick of.

Again, our dog seemed to like it...but she developed a terrible case of diarrhea. We fed her chicken and rice for a while 'til things calmed down. We switched to Science Diet for sensitive stomachs, and then Eukanuba for retrievers. (Sadie is a flat coated retriever.) Her tummy troubles went away. After finishing those bags, we restarted Taste of the Wild...and the diarrhea returned. We looked at a lot of different variables...and it really seems to be this particular food that caused the problem.<br /><br />We won't be buying it again. In fact, we are throwing away what we have left.",1

I expect the single malt scotch I purchase this month will be similar to the one I bought six months ago, all things remaining the same. In my experience, I have had Ahmad Earl Grey Tea that's knocked off my socks with a rich flavor, filled with the bergamot that attracts me to Earl Grey. The box I'm currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that I don't know if it will actually be drunk. All boxes I've had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea, but I am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains. Instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation, I develop a stomach ache, so I'm now skipping the entire second cup.  The tea was recently purchased, so staleness is likely not an issue.",3

B000UBDKII,Phew!  Am I glad I found these Senseo Paris French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods!  All of my local stores either do not carry them anymore or are charging over $5 for one 16-count bag.  The 6 bag pack should easily cover the 3 month subscription time frame as I only use one pod a day.  The other great thing is that the package's expiration date is many months in the future so I know they are fresh!  I highly recommend subscribing to the automatic re-order system. Thank you Amazon.com!,5
B004TI4SIE,"The product came as advertised. For the amount you get, the price is right, but the taste of the ginger is stronger than I expected. In fact, it's actually very, very spicy; it burns my tongue and throat, but not as if I were eating hot salsa. Will try using more water, to dilute the flavor.",3

Lastly, it wasn't as fresh tasting like at our local movie theatre, which uses Orville Redenbacher. I'm going to google and see what Orville Redenbacher makes for kettle popcorn makers.",1
B003FSPWXY,"this product is tasty. You add a half lb of ground beef, 2 cups milk, and some water. It is very much like Hamburger Helper but with less processed ingredients and whole wheat pasta mix.

B003EML8PM,"Great product, I never cook this in the microwave because sometimes it takes longer and not all microwaves are the same.  I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they ""poof"" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook.",5

The salt is more coarse, thus it doesn't stick to popcorn as well. I would've probably been happy as a pickle if I had tried this first, as popcorn salt has disappeared off grocery store shelves (beggars can't be choosers).

ZERO taste is more like it. And what's up with the picture which I think is kind of deceptive?  First of all there are no 'cookies' and the product is a mousey brown color which is totally unappealing.  Then once you get past that and dig in not even by the biggest stretch of your imagination would you mistake this tasteless gook as some kind of dessert.

I hesitated on this brand because of the price, but then when I saw how limited my choices were I broke down and ordered a few of the flavors.  I have to say I am very pleased with the quality.  I also ordered some Evo venison and duck as well as the Natural Balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas.  Neither of those COMPARE to this brand and my cats testify to that as well as I do.  The texture is so much better and she loves these the most.  I have gotten her the rabbit, duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either Evo or Natural Balance.  I do have to say that of those lesser brands, the Natural Balance venison does have a nice texture and not as ""pasty"" as the duck with peas.  Mabel wasn't as crazy about it though, although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the Instinct brand.  When you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something, when you find something she will, it is worth it's weight in gold!  This brand is a keeper.",5

B00430B73W,I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.<br />I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients. I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items.,1
B000G6MBUA,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle BrandÂ® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle BrandÂ® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",1

B000H26J7E,"The old recipe for 70% Lindt bars was perfect -- it was just the right balance, and my favorite dark chocolate bar at the price point.<br /><br />The new one is flavorless and waxy, tastes like I'm biting into a brown crayon.  I'd rather eat a Hershey bar.  No idea what Lindt is thinking.  Their website says they made this change after extensive consumer tests showed folks wanted a ""smoother"" taste with a ""less intense cocoa flavor.""  Who on earth would buy a chocolate bar advertising 70% cocoa content and expect it not to be intense?",1

B001EW5YQS,"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.<br /><br />Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.<br /><br />I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.<br /><br />This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.<br /><br />BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.<br /><br />*For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options.",2

B006BXUVPY,"I have never been a big fan of the original Cheez-Its although others in my household seem to love them. I really enjoyed this Mozzarella variety much more than the original flavor, although it was a bit strong and overwhelming.  For the general public, I would give these 4 stars. However, I changed my way of eating over 6 months ago and no longer eat foods with additives, preservatives, trans fat and other non-healthy ingredients (basically, most processed foods). If you fall into the category of being one who watches for this stuff as well, be aware these have enriched flour and a number of additives and ingredients you probably do not want in your snacks. I am happy to report there is no trans fat or high fructose corn syrup, which seems to be overwhelmingly prevalent in many processed foods today. Overall, I would eat these if I had to or really needed a snack and other options were not available.",3

B0013NUGDE,"I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.",3

Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.",1
B001ELLB4S,"This is a great tasting hemp protein powder.  I decided to stop using muscle milk because of the artificial sweetener and the issues surrounding absorption of whey protein.

I have no issues digesting the shake and I'm thrilled to be getting protein that is easily digestible.  A simple shake recipe is included on the tub which tastes great, but I've been using this powder as the base for my morning kale shake.

B004K30HO2,"There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over-priced coffee, which is what these machines are designed to do.<br /><br />1. No matter what method I use, I have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer/gasket down as far as I can on the upper needle. This will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow.<br /><br />2. Just as importantly when I put the DisposaKup in, I press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely. This will make sure you have a flow of water that streams through the cup.<br /><br />3. Fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup, do not press the coffee down or pack it in.<br /><br />The key is take a couple extra seconds and these will work perfectly and you will save money.

I thought cloves taste like cloves... and didn't really think much of it.  Well, unfortunately these Simply Organic cloves do not taste like the McCormick, Badia, or even Store Brand ground cloves I've bought.  They don't taste like the whole cloves I've ground by hand in a spice blender either.  They taste... weird.  Just off a bit.  The color is redder too.  We go through a lot of cloves in my house--both using it in tea as a flavoring and in cooking/baking.  I've never encountered this before.<br /><br />Packaging is nice.  Price was great.  Amazon did a great job in wrapping it in a ton of bubble wrap.  But now I'm stuck with three large bottles of cloves that I don't see myself finishing.

B0028GY93S,"My main reason for purchasing this dog food was that I wanted a food made here in the U.S., of natural ingredients and not made in a plant where chemicals are processed.<br />Recently I have lost 2 of my beloved small animals to a company who produces pet foods in the same plant as chemicals, pesticides, and other cleaning agents. It is my belief that carelessness and greed led to contaminated small animal food that killed my 2 pets.<br /><br />I have a 65lb German Shepherd/Aussie mix with a leg injury, and joint problems. She has always been very active & full of energy for her age of 8 years old. In the past I've tried either making her food or searching out holistic foods that are made here in the U.S. with natural ingredients.<br /><br />We started out with a small bag of this food at first to see if she would eat it. Immediately she loved it! She had no stomach upset, even though her stomach is sensitive. Right away her coat started getting softer & shinier. There wasn't as much problems with her joints and leg injury as before and I did notice even more energy in her!<br /><br />Now that I've been feeding her this for a while her coat has continued to soften, looks shinier & no more scratching! She's maintained her regular weight without gaining any. Her energy level is amplified and she's showing very little discomfort in her joints & with her leg injury. What I love best is that she eats every last bite of this food when its feeding time, when before she would only pick at her food. I've fed her other brands of holistic, natural and organic foods and none of them were this much of a hit with her. This food really has made a difference in her overall health, coat and energy levels. None of the other foods made her coat this soft!<br /><br />These are bite sized pieces of food that an older or smaller dog would be able to eat. Mine doesn't like big chunks of food, she prefers the smaller bites so this one is perfect for her. Oh, and upon opening this bag the scent is like meat not bread or preservatives in other foods. This food isn't greasy either like many of the others we've tried in the past that leave stains on the floor if it drops and she misses a piece.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this food to everyone who has a small or large dog. The differences you will notice right away in your dog will make you a believer in this food as well!",5

B003EML8PM,"I normally rate whatever items I buy but rarely offer words of advice. Well, these things changed my mind. I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.<br /><br />I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love.",1
B003VXFK44,"Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name ""Wolfgang Puck"", I expect to be impressed. This (to my taste) is very average tasting coffee.

B000FA38ZY,"I admit that while the structure of this cookie seems familiar, I'm not particularly acquainted with ""Mallomars"". Now, to start with, I'm a cookie lover, a marshmallow lover, and a chocolate lover. This has all three -- they are practically s'mores with cookies instead of graham crackers. But eating them I can't help but feel like they are just really in 'average' department. The mallow part is somewhat tough, and there's only a thin layer of chocolate. I like the cookie part, but it's not enough to give the whole thing a higher rating -- especially as it's pretty expensive (over $5 for an 8 oz box) and though it's a small nitpick, it's hard to recommend anything, especially something meant as a snack and already high in calories, with high fructose corn syrup in it.<br /><br />Maybe if they were a bit healthier and tasted a bit less....processed....I'd give it higher marks.

B002IEZJMA,"In a nutshell this is a 6.8oz Italian Espresso style drink, made in Denmark, by the Coco-Cola company, sweetened with 10g of sugar, comes in a small can and has 50 calories.<br /><br />I don't usually drink coffee from a can so this was an interesting trial. I tried this two ways, first as a straight espresso. But since I don't drink my coffee room temperature, I heated it up in a microwave. Straight up, I'd say this was a little weak, and the 10g of sugar doesn't do anything for it. If I drink it black, 10g of sugar takes a little of the bite away; if I drink it sweetened, it's not sweet enough. It's a like a matter of trying to please everyone but not making anyone happy.<br /><br />Next, I tried it as a latte and added some milk and heated it up. I usually drink my latte without sugar but since this already had a little and not enough at that, I sweetened it a little more. As a latte it was actually not bad.<br /><br />The taste is a little bland (not talking about strength but flavor) but I'm accustomed to making my own coffee from different beans so I wouldn't mark it down that much. It says it's 100% Arabica but that doesn't really tell you much since the most common bean grown is C. arabica. Is it the dregs swept from around the world or is it the finest hand picked? Coffee taste itself is very subjective so all I'm saying here is that the taste is not very specific to a region that I can tell. I really have to give kudos for Coca-Cola for trying to make a canned presentation out of a product whose taste is so personal and difficult to please.<br /><br />It doesn't have any caffeine information on the can but I wonder if they juiced it up because it gave me a buzz that I only usually get when I drink extra concentrated coffee.<br /><br />I would think that cans like this are meant to be drunk cold from the fridge or from a cooler and unfortunately I didn't think to save some of it to drink with ice or cold. But overall I think it's an OK substitute for someone who needs his coffee fix when there is absolutely no cafe around and it's not too bad for a situation like that.",3

B0035Q0N0I,"Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.",4
B004JRKEH4,"I ordered this up because I often get the southwest chipotle sauce at a certain national sandwich shop. I thought it might be great to have this flavor at home. The Taco Bell version had the spice, but not the flavor I was looking for. In addition to trying the sauce on my favorite turkey sandwich I also tried it on a tossed salad which was good. At the end of the day, I'm glad I tried it and I certainly didn't think it was so bad I should throw away the unused quantity. That said, it just wasn't what I was hoping for and I'm not sure I'd order it again.",3

B006ACQYB6,"Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).",3
B003EML8PM,The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.,2

B008ZRKZSM,"Doesn't taste as good as real peanut butter of course, BUT the small amount of flavor lost is worth the trade off considering how much healthier it is.  The texture/consistency is also pretty much the same as normal PB once mixed.  If you just care about calories/fat and not so much about sodium, adding salt makes it taste a lot better.",4

B0013TJ5T4,I have purchased Boyers Rocky Mountain Thunder in the past directly from Boyer's in Denver and been very satisfied with the product.

(adapted to get a 25 second draw)<br /><br />Once you get the right RECIPE they all work.<br /><br />But .....<br />Where this product comes in handy is NOT IN BREWING coffee, but in storing your recipe in an AIR TIGHT CONTAINER.<br /><br />Grind a weeks worth of coffee and store it in these cups with the lid on and no holes in the bottom.<br /><br />Then during the week, grab one of these already premeasured cups,<br />remove the lid<br />and pour into the My Keuring K-Cup<br /><br />I found that if the grind is toward the fine side, all these will leak. The My K-cup was the best of the lot for not leaking,<br />But like I said above if the get the grind more toward the coarse side they ALL WILL WORK.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />This product is great for storing pre-measured amounts that you have ground earlier in weekly batches.<br />Make your measuring and grinding mess ONCE and then fill up 14 or so of these cups with your own recipe.<br /><br />If you want to get more accurate, instead of using tablespoons get a good digital scale for weighing.<br /><br />Note that if you are in a hurry then go ahead and DO USE THIS PRODUCT as advertised here.<br />I just thought that these were too expensive also and that you had to keep reordering them.<br />But yes go ahead and use them if you want to do that.",5

B003KLSZGW,"Each of these flatbread crackers has 4 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and only 100 calories, so they're substantive and filling by themselves. However, because they're so firm and sturdy, they make a good base for more complex snacks.<br /><br />One very simple addition is to sprinkle shredded cheese on top of a cracker and microwave it until the cheese melts (~15 seconds). You could even stack another cracker on top before microwaving to make a tightly-bonded cheese-and-flatbread sandwich.<br /><br />Just about any recipe you would normally make on top of a cracker or on top of a piece of toast can work here.",5

There was no ice pack in the box at all to help keep the items from melting. I ordered chocolate from other companies on Amazon and all their chocolate arrived in excellent condition, but this was horrible. I'm sure the chocolate will taste great once it reforms its melted self though!

It has a good flavor and is great for baking, frying, etc.  I even like the tins, and I use a can opening to remove the tops when the tins are empty and use them for cute storage.  The price has gone WAY up recently though, which is really frustrating. Amazon has a history of jacking the price up on anything that sells well or gets good reviews.

B003CK7O36,"First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not).",3
B001LGGH40,"The Switch is not a soda -- it's fruit juice with carbonation. Still, drinking it is very much like drinking a soda, but you get your Vitamin C. I found the balance of sweetness and carbonation to be good, although just a little more carbonation would give this an added zip.<br /><br />What I especially like about this product is that it is all natural and there is no high-fructose corn syrup in the drink. However, this is not a low-calorie beverage, and the 8.3 ounce can had more than 100 calories. If you are going to include this product in your diet, be aware of that. It is fruit juice -- and yes, it has the calories. But this is a food and not just empty soda calories.<br /><br />I gave this flavor 4 stars because I found the kiwi flavor somewhat lacking. It's not bad, I just think the apple juice was more noticeable, although the strawberry flavor came through nicely. A stronger kiwi-strawberry flavor would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />As for the can, I found the zip tab a little difficult to open because of the proximity of the ring to the edge of the can. But I'm a bit of a klutz; I have problems with potato chip bags. So take this caveat with a grain of salt. I think the manufacturer has found a good size for the cans, because you get just enough of the drink to feel like you've had a treat, but not so much that the calorie count is on overkill.",4

For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.

Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic.",5

B002NHYQAS,"Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate bar is a tasty, fairly creamy chocolate bar.  One bite will satisfy your mid-afternoon chocolate craving and hopefully help you make it through the rest of the day.  Of course, any bite of chocolate around that time would probably do the same, so why choose this one?<br /><br />Its socially responsible.  The cocoa beans are grown on rainforest certified farms. From their website, ""The Rainforest Alliance Certified(tm) seal guarantees that the cocoa in our Signature Series was grown on farms that meet comprehensive standards for sustainable farming, protecting soil, waterways and wildlife habitat as well as the rights and welfare of workers, their families and communities.""<br /><br />Its organic.  Newman's Own is certified by Oregon Tilth.  If organic foods are important to you, Oregon Tilth certification is your guarantee that high standards have been met.<br /><br />Its simple.  Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, and organic vanilla.<br /><br />Its yummy.  54% cocoa means its intensely chocolatey.  There is a hint of sweetness, but it retains the bitterness dark chocolate fans like.  Not too creamy, not too dry.<br /><br />Compared to a few other dark chocolate bars, Newman's Own stands up pretty well.  I did a little taste test with the following: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001988CN4"">Organic Dark Chocolate with Almonds - 3.5 oz Bar</a> was the best, but it had an unfair advantage with the addition of almond bits. It was a little creamier than Newman's Own. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016XLU4"">Organic Dark Chocolate - Regular, 59% cocoa, 12 Units / 2 oz</a> was almost indistinguishable from Newman's Own. Same texture and very similar flavor, perhaps slightly more intense. Trader Joe's Fair Trade Swiss Dark chocolate had 71% cocoa so it had a drier texture.  I even tried one by Ikea, which was inexpensive and chocolatey, but actually my least favorite.  It did not appear to be fair trade or organic.<br /><br />Overall, a good solid organic fair trade dark chocolate bar.  Dark chocolate fans will like it, milk chocolate fans might be converted.",4

But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.

B004SISLQ0,I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.,4
B001D6KP14,"I was very happy with the way this turned out. It is very similar to traditional American beers(Bud/Coors) but with an extra kick. The flavor is very smooth, has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes. This is a great beer to start with for new brewers and veterans alike. If you are to anxious to wait for it to age, you can drink it after 2 weeks. It will taste good, but get better with age. Make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates. Lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions.",5

B006J4MAIQ,"It's a challenge to review food, since so much of it is a matter of taste.  Although I think some people will like this granola a lot, it wasn't for me.<br /><br />This is a high-quality granola, flavored with cocoa and coconut, with chunks of dark chocolate and freeze dried strawberries and berries.  The texture is excellent, and contrasts well with milk or yogurt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I thought there was way too much chocolate.  The dominant flavor is cocoa, followed by the oats, then the chunks of chocolate.  The berries are pretty sparse, and I couldn't detect the coconut.  As I said, it might be right for some people, but I found the cocoa aftertaste to be offputting and am not a fan.",2

B0014EQHK8,"This soup is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a filling snack without compromising their diet. It might not be the tastiest one out there but the flavor is palatable enough, and for only 125 calories a can you'd be surprised how many wontons there are in there. A bowl of this soup with a slice of toast makes for a surprisingly satisfying &lt;200 calorie meal that keeps me full for several hours - you can't beat that!<br /><br />Something to be aware of, however, is that the sodium content of this stuff is quite high. An entire can contains almost 2200mg of sodium, which is over 90% of the recommended daily allowance for adults. So if you are trying to watch your sodium or even if you have a lot of other salty foods in your diet, this soup might not be for you.",4
B001TI8RHA,"Having just visited Pat O'Briens in New Orleans, I immediately ordered some of this mix to enjoy at home.<br /><br />I prepared it exactly according to the directions, including the use of good-quality dark rum (Myer's).<br /><br />It was good, but NOTHING like the Hurricanes we had on Bourbon Street.  The taste of an authentic Hurricane was still fresh in my mind (having enjoyed, um, several of them), and I found this mixer overly sweet and heavy, and only vaguely familiar.  It was like rum mixed with Hawaiian Punch if the punch was more syrupy.<br /><br />It was good, but not authentic.  It seems the only way to enjoy an authentic Hurricane is to spend $7.50 for one at Pat O'Briens on Bourbon Street.",2

These strawberries are not crunchy, but rather chewy.  For me, they did not have a desirable texture.  It seems that one of two things may have happened here; either not all water was removed during the freeze-drying process or somehow air (and moisture) got into the package, taking away from the product's crunch.  Also buyer beware, because these packages are only 1 ounce, not 1.5 as the picture and product description state.",2

B001LGGH40,"***<br />The Switch claims to be an alternative to unhealthy sodas, and it is that--it is much healthy than most of the commercial versions out there. It does provide 100% of the day's vitamin C and does contain only fruit juice concentrates, no added sugars, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and no gluten.<br /><br />However...it is cloyingly sweet--a great taste of kiwi and strawberries--but way too sweet for me. The Switch also provides a huge sugar hit via the fructose in the highly concentrated juices and has 135 calories in only 8.3 fluid ounces. Of 34 grams of carbohydrates, 33 are from sugar.<br /><br />I don't carbo load, so it doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'd rather eat the real fruit and get the fiber and other ingredients, or else have a less sweet drink. I tried using it as a concentrate and mixing 1 part soda to 3 parts water, which made it drinkable for me; although this worked well, I'd still probably stick with other beverages.<br /><br />Recommended, only if you want to ease your way off of unhealthy sodas and like very sweet drinks.<br />***",3

B000LKVDUU,"These prepackaged curries are edible but not too tasty. Even by the low standards of Indian food in foil pouches. Do not even think of telling an actual Indian person this is any good. Really the only upside is that one of these just takes a couple minutes in the microwave to heat up, so if you need to eat RIGHT NOW and you don't much care what you eat, this could theoretically work. Though, if you absolutely must have curry in a pouch, I can think of at least one well-known private-label grocery store brand that is far better for roughly the same price if not cheaper. If you just want very fast food out of your own kitchen, there have got to be better alternatives.",2

And while nothing will help you if you don't get most --or all-- of the sleep you need, little things can help. Back in the day there was coffee and soda and not much else. Now there are dozens of products that will claim to offer the boost you need.<br /><br />During a 12-hour overnight shift, I usually take one of these with a meal about halfway through. Doing so seems to get me over that middle of the night hump. Sometimes I'll take a second just before heading home to share the road with all the ""normal"" drivers.<br /><br />These are low in caffeine and calories.

B000OYMGMC,"Tootsie roll pops, the first lollipop with a chewy center, were born in 1931 at the Sweets Company of America. The company changed its name to Tootsie Roll Industries in 1966. Tootsie Roll Pops are the number one selling lollipop. Bought singly or by the bag, one might pay from 16 to 20 cents for a single pop. The cost conscious consumer buying them by the box of 100 will pay 8 cents or less per pop.<br /><br />A .6 ounce tootsie roll pop has 60 calories, no fat, no cholesterol, no protein,15g of carbs, 10g of sugar, and no vitamins. It's a low calorie way to get that sugar fix if the consumer limits himself/herself to one or two pops. Pops last much longer than a chocolate bar without the high fat and calorie count.<br /><br />Mrs. Spudman is almost addicted to these confections. I buy them by the box of 100 at BJ's. She takes out the flavors she likes and gives the rest to me to enjoy for myself or take to work for the students. (I just bit into the center. Just couldn't help myself.)<br /><br />They are a popular commodity and disappear quickly although I've noticed that the ones in the green wrappers are always the last to go.<br />I like that they last so long and satisfy my sugar cravings. Also I can pop one in my mouth and continue to type or do whatever with my hands free, only occasionally taking the pop out of my mouth to check on its progress or diminishing shell.<br /><br />The price for a box of pops here is a bit high, but consider that it is being delivered to your door.",4

B005VOOQLO,"It's hard to describe the taste of this version of MiO (Green Thunder, originally 'Thunder Punch'). It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6Âµg (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors).",3

B00213ERI0,"These are very very good tasting. Crispy cookies, especially delicious when dipped in milk. They say gluten free, and I totally believe they are, because I did not have a wheat-type reaction. But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas?

B005CUU25G,"I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.",2

When you get the teas it says to add a Tsp for every 6oz but you almost have to triple that amount to get any kind of distinction of taste from the teas,  the only one at all that has any taste for the amount directed is the mint tea which with its powerful aroma is no surprise.  All I can say is this isn't worth the price try another seller or just stay with the teas you like now,  because even for Amazon prime members who can get the free two day shipping $25.00 dollars for this poor level of quality tea is not worth wasting your money on.

I jumped at the chance for my dog to give it a try. When this arrived it came in a large bag, I thought this would have been a tiny little bag of treats, it was not,  the treats inside were very large 2-1/4"" long and about 2"" wide and about 1/2' thick. It also had a nice crease in the middle to brak it in half if  you choose to give a smaller treat. As most treats they smell awful but I guess a dog would like that.<br /><br />I gave my dog, a constantly hungry Black Pug, a choice of his frozen treat in one hand and Newman's own in the other, he took a while but chose his treat.<br /><br />I then gave him Newman's own treat and he took it but he sniffed at it for awhile.  Now he knows what it is.

B003ANFMY8,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

But I'm not a fan of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee, French Roast.  It leaves a funny taste in my mouth that I can't quite identify, and I tried this coffee black, with sugar, with sugar and skim milk.  That unidentifiable funny taste was still there.  As I've never tried a ""low-acid"" coffee before trying this product, I don't know whether to pin it on Puroast as a brand, as something they do with their beans, or if the strange taste is a trade-off in low-acid coffee.  In the days since trying this coffee, I've had other brands/kinds of coffee and have not had that weird taste, so I don't think it's me.  Your experience could be different, but I'm not a fan of this one.",2

So I bought it with confidence thinking that although it was not organic, it was free of sulfur dioxide. Yesterday I opened it up to make some salad dressing for my raw dishes only to realize by just watching the color of the product alone that it had some additive which the ingredient list confirmed. I can't return the product so now I am stuck with 3 lbs of unsatisfactory product and I still have to go buy additional product that is sulfur free!<br />Roland your company needs to indicate in the description that it's sun-dried product contains sulfur dioxide, health is a big concern so  you don't want to be responsible for any kind of customer health issues from this product.<br />Buyer beware!",1

B001EO5QZK,"I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

B001LG945O,"I didn't really like the taste of this product much.  It has an artificial taste to me, even though it is juice and water.  It is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin, although not quite that bad.  I did drink the whole can.  The 8.3 oz can is narrow, compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing.<br /><br />The can says it is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and gluten free.  The nutrition box indicates (for the entire 8.3 oz can) 15mg sodium, 36g carbs, 34 g sugar, Vitamin C 100 %, Vitamin A 20%.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order: 100% juice (filtering sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Contains soy. (First ingredient listed is supposed to be the one there is the most of.)<br /><br />You may wonder why I spent so much time on the ingredients.  Well, if you don't read labels, you really should start.  Some products may taste really good but may be full of nasty things you really do not want your children to eat (or yourself).  The term, gluten free, for example is VERY important to those who have gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and I would have liked to have given this flavor a better review, but the taste was not there for me.

B004AJRM44,"I purchased one of these packages recently to try out a new bread maker and I highly regret that I did. 1 & 1/2 pound loaf? Yea right, I followed the instructions to the T and What I got was a 4-5 inch tall ball of baked doughy mess. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I was already skeptical that such a small amount of dry ingredients could make a 1 1/2 pound loaf of bread and they just proved me right. It was so horrible and inedible that at first I thought the problem might have been my bread maker. Then I tried the ""Light Oat Bread"" recipe on allrecipes.com on the same exact setting and what do I get? a PERFECT loaf of bread with very little more effort/time.  Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of bread mix, or just look up a Bread Machine recipe on one of the several sites on the internet that have them, Buy 10-15 dollars of ingredients (instead of wasting nearly 3 bucks on this crap that gives you an inedible less-than-half-loaf) and that will probably be enough for at least 10 loafs of bread.",1

B005GIF5VU,"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",3

B005MWAM72,"I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of ""value pack"" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the ""new"" improved package at Stop & Shop.<br /><br />The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.<br />How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release ""New Coke"" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)<br /><br />Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those ""We heard you, and we're making it right"" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me.",1

At only 75 calories, 5 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbs per serving I cannot think of a healthier salty ""treat"" to indulge in.  The package is very small only 1/2 an oz so its a good size for those of us who can only eat very small portions.  The taste is very much like the crunchy cheese that gets stuck to a pizza pan.  I have only tried the ""grilled cheese"" flavor which doesn't have any additional flavoring powder on it so I think it is less salty than other versions of this snack.  I will be ordering them again, for sure!",4
B001ELLB4S,"I've been drinking Nutiva's Hempshakes nearly every weekday for more than two years now, and it's an excellent product, but not everyone is going to like the stuff.  If you're used to traditional whey-based protein powders and want something similar, you may not like this.  It's a bit of an acquired taste and has a different mouth feel.  I don't like whey or soy powders, and wanted something with a lot of fiber that wouldn't aggravate my acid reflux.  The hempshakes fit the bill for me.  I can drink them mixed in soy or rice milk, but usually I make a quick smoothie in the morning to drink in the car while I'm taking my son to school.  This fills up for a few hours but doesn't make me feel stuffed.  I blend together 1/2 cup juice (usually Odwalla Blueberry B Monster), 1 cup soy or rice milk, a banana, and 4 tablespoons of hempshake powder.  If I need it to last me until lunchtime I'll add in a cup of frozen berries.  It's a healthy way for me to start the day, and I don't end up skipping breakfast anymore.<br /><br />I haven't noticed a big difference between the old formulation and the new, except that the new seems a little smoother so I'd guess it's probably not as gritty if you're drinking it straight rather than in a smoothie.<br /><br />Long story short:  good product, but if the word ""hemp"" makes you cringe or laugh, this probably isn't something you're going to like.",5
B0002IMRTC,"A soft drink does seem like a trivial item to review especially since the general category of food and beverages depends more on one's own palate. A friend of mine introduced me to this drink based on his own childhood remembrance in the Midwest.

And you certainly can't drink it like Diet Coke since it is an astonishing 200 calories a can. But baby boomers should have a stash when they feel like a walk down a sugar-infested memory lane.

B00866AM2G,"Vita Coco coconut water is a wonderful, good tasting, health enhancing product. I really like it, like it very much, drink it all the time. But, as other reviewers have noted, the containers are very vulnerable to bursting in shipment. My few first couple of shipments arrived in perfect shape. But then one container was simply missing from a soggy box two shipments ago. I let that go because everything else was fine. But my most recent shipment never even arrived. UPS declared it ""undeliverable"" and returned it to Amazon in Indiana (along with a Splenda shipment in the same box). After that . . . nothing. No refund. No replacement. No word from Amazon at all. And no way to contact Amazon to ask for a refund without my agreeing to return the package which they already had received. In my frustration, I have chosen this review to perhaps catch someone's attention at Amazon. I remain a great fan of and a great user of Amazon, but this one time . . . Catch 22. So, to repeat, I think Vita Coco is terrific. It does need better packaging however, so buyer beware. And Amazon, please fix your website so loyal customers like me don't get caught in a cul-de-sac, having to pay for products we never even received.",3
B0062A87HA,"Like a number of other reviewers, we use canned pumpkin as a dietary supplement for our dogs. As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's brand which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.<br /><br />A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service.

B005ZBZLT4,"This was an extremely affordable item, but the old adage you get what you pay for applies here.  The coffee was nothing special and tasted like discount coffee.  One of the best aspects of the single-cup coffee maker is that you get a cup of coffee that is strong (depending upon your preference), fresh and, tastes like a cup of coffee from one of the chain reatil locations, without the retail price. This coffee tasted like weak, old coffee - coffee that was made in a drip maker.  In my opinion, not a ""Fog Chaser"" at all.",2
B001BDDTB2,"I've got 2 cats that love their wet food!!  We figured this'd be a big hit & for the 1st couple cans it was.  My cats are used to your everyday  mushy cat food (Friskies I think), so when we opened this stuff I was surprised to see that this stuff actually looked almost some what edible.  It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(.",3

I eat Naga Jolokia sauce on a daily basis and this doesn't quite reach the same heat level and the taste is really bad in comparison.

B002IEZJMA,"Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand.",3
B001E0T29K,"I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new ""worst"" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.

B002NHYQAS,"I have tried a couple of products from the Newman's Own line and, while I didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type, they definitely held their own.  I sadly did not find this to be true with the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.<br /><br />When it comes to reviewing edible products, I find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand.  Because I love Dove Dark Chocolate (though I try many different kinds of dark chocolate), I used the Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate Bar as comparison (though I prefer the Dove Promise individual bites, it was easier to compare bar to bar).<br /><br />The Dove Dark Bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar.  The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is 64 grams, nearly double the size of the Dove Bar, and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar.  Now, I am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person (probably more, in fact), but there is no way I need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting (especially sub-par chocolate).<br /><br />In most nutritional areas, especially fat and sat fat, the 33g Dove bar and the 64g Newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other.  Newman's only clear win over the Dove bar is on cholesterol, having 0mg even though it is double the size of the Dove (which has 5mg cholesterol).  For those watching sugar, the smaller Dove bar has 17g while Big Daddy Newman has 37g.<br /><br />With the health business out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks--taste and texture:<br /><br />Texture.  I am accustomed to the smooth, creamy texture of Dove dark chocolate--I find its mouth feel luxurious.  My initial thought on biting into and chewing the Newman was waxiness--quite nasty at first but, once I got it chewed, it had a nicer mouth feel.  It is not creamy like Dove, but it loses the waxiness once chewed.<br /><br />Taste.  The only thing particularly pleasant to me about the Newman bar was the finish...the very last taste as you're swallowing it.  That has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and, despite the 37g of sugar in it, is not overly sweet, which is nice.  As for Dove, the entire process of biting into it, chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable, so there is no contest.<br /><br />In summary, if you have your heart set on contributing to Newman's Own because of the good work they do, or you must have an organic chocolate bar, I suppose this will do.  But it is not, in my opinion, any competition for ANY other brand of good dark chocolate I have tried.",2

B001CWV4PA,"Glutino gluten free crackers are probably the closest thing you can get to Ritz or club-like crackers. These crackers are crisp without feeling stale and have a nice crunch that I miss with regular crackers. The flavor is decent, I never ate crackers alone and I still don't, I judge the taste more on how well it pairs with dips, spreads and cheese. The flavor it subtle enough that you can put virtually anything on top. Be warned they get stale very quickly so keep them in a zip-lock bag even if they are in the box. The price of course is another downside but just like all other gluten free foods, I have developed an aversion to over-priced gluten free products.",4

B000KV61FC,"I wanted to use this as an alternative to a Kong, to fill with lunch for my dog on days when she would be alone all day while I was at work, and my husband was out of town. The product arrived with a rubber ""rope"" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber ""rope"". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer.",2

I couldn't tell for sure as it only made a couple of cups but I didn't have any excess acid reaction to the coffee. Not that I usually do, but occasionally I can experience some symptoms. None in this case. Not really a scientific study, but it is what it is. Very conveniently packaged. Try it.",4

B000BPR1AQ,"Using this product during mosquito season in Alaska resulted in roughly 3x the bites as the low percentage deet formulation it replaced in our toolbox.  It does not cut down significantly on the mosquitoes attracted as deet does, but it does appear to prevent a decent percentage of insects that alight upon your skin from actually biting.<br /><br />On windy days with light bug pressure it works quite well, but anytime the wind falls we now become a swarming mass of bugs even with heavy applications.  Probably suitable for low-pressure areas with limited bugs, we can top 1,000 bites/hour in many areas and it just doesn't cut that number down to a ""sane"" level even if it does block MANY if not all or most of them.

Bought everything you can expect at a fondue party (we've been researching for months).  The chocolate fondue was a huge success however this product didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />The flavors together were a sort of sharp cheese mix which we enjoyed however it was stringy and never truly melted into what you would expect in a fondue cheese pot.  We 'may' purchase this again to try however we're thinking of going with another cheese fondue mix (mexican anyone?).

I purchased this because I really enjoy cinnamon tea, all of the reviews raved about this product and its great cinnamon taste so I took their advice and purchased 6 boxes.  I received the tea yesterday (good ol' Amazon), quickly made myself a cup only to find out it has zero, nodda, zilch cinnamon taste.  I mean they mine as well just label this black tea and call it a day, there is not even a hint of cinnamon flavor or any flavor for that matter in the tea aside from black tea.  While I do enjoy flavored tea, I am not a fan of plain tea and I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this product.

B00016AU3K,"I tried the Yogi Kava Stress Relief tea after being a user of Valerian root in my herbal tea for a while a year or so ago and having some success with that but wanting to try something different - I was finding myself in a situation where on most days I needed to get up at one consistent time but then one day of the week I needed to get up three hours earlier, thus causing a great amount of upheaval in my sleep schedule the night before and then after that early morning.<br /><br />As some earlier reviewers have noted, there is a strong, almost metallic note to this tea. I have tried Stevia as a sweetener previously and had not particularly cared for it, but that did not seem to constitute the entire ""note"" that I was sensing and not finding pleasing here, so some of it must be the herb itself. However, this taste is not any more displeasing than Valerian is to my palate when I compare them.<br /><br />I steep two of the teabags for approximately 7-8 minutes with the water almost a boil when I add it to the tea (the instructions said that the tea could be steeped for as long as 10 minutes). I add just a splash of cream and a generous tablespoon of clover honey to mine, and within twenty minutes I feel the effects. Some have noted that they do not feel any differently - I can say that I do, but I should mention to be fair that I am a mere five feet two inches and barely clock in at above one hundred pounds.  Still, I would say that this is to its credit - it wouldn't put me to sleep if I used one teabag for test anxiety, which I foresee using it for in the very near future. Instead of knocking you out, it simply stops your mind from racing relentlessly, or at least that has been my experience.",4
B001EW5YQS,"I'll add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the Windows 7 ""USB Audio Device"" error.  I figured I had a 50% chance of it working.  It didn't.  Windows 7 insists on loading a USB driver that doesn't work.  There is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process, however, that did not work for me.  Its easier to return this thing, than spend my whole weekend jerking around in Windows 7 hardware manager.<br /><br />Blue probably has a good product here, and probably blames Windows for this issue.  However, BLUE should provide a driver that works.  Don't rely on Windows to do this.  That is corporate laziness.  Spend some resources on programming something that works for Windows 7... make it available on your support website, and make it true plug and play.  Not plug and cross-fingers, then spend hours messing around in the weeds of Windows settings.<br /><br />Also agree with other reviews here... in the 2 days I spent with this product... it's all plastic parts, feels cheap and fragile, and the gain button is poorly thought out.<br /><br />Hey Blue... you had my business... then you lost me.

I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids.",4

My epic fail. Too much, too often, equals wasted uneaten cans.<br /><br />I place Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken on reserve, serving it 2X total (breakfast and dinner) per week, due to the high cost hence one less star in my review.",4

Received three jars, opened one and olives were mushy with an odd ""off"" taste. Second jar was same, off taste, smell and mushiness. I almost threw third jar away unopened but I'm stubborn and I paid a lot for these damn olives! Finally, a decent olive - not great but some proper olive taste, nice brine and crispness. For the cost/shipping I feel ripped off. It's like they sent two bad jars and one good. I won't ever order these from Amazon again. In fact Gristede's carries Mezzetta Martini olives and the olives and Vermouth are really delicious - not a mushy one in the bunch and the liquid makes a great dirty martini. Best, a case of six was less than this order. I've got my fingers crossed they won't be mushy when they arrive. I think the vinegar and vermouth softens the Leone olives - the Mezzetta olives are as sans vinegar. If you love olives give the Mezzetta's try.",2

Flavors are comparable to Flavor-Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, I'm not sure if we'd choose these over another brand, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ;-)",3

The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains.",2

B001BDDTB2,"I purchaed the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.",3
B001LG945O,"I suspect this drink is an acquired taste. After the first sip, I was reluctant to take another. The second sip was an improvement and the third even more so. By the end of the can, I was finding it fairly enjoyable.<br /><br />It was only after I had finished that I noted the Alka Seltzer-like aftermath. Yuck.<br /><br />Still, I am sure I could get used to it after a few more tries. This is, I think, the problem with the drink: I would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me, not because I was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment.<br /><br />I would not buy it again.",2
B0002DHNY6,My dogs love these as treats but maintaining them with their Kong is kind of a pain.

B0079KWXKY,This is awful tasting and for the price with shipping turned out to be $10 a bottle. Bought for my son's birthday party and some of the boys were puking and gaging it was so bad. You are better off buying a bottle of Franks hot sauce and chugging it down...at least it tastes good. This was my BIGGEST rip-off buy EVER!!!,1
B001E4Q5WI,This peanut butter is the best and only peanut butter I will eat. I refuse any other kind. I particularly enjoy the skippy reduced fat because A) it is a tad healthier and B) it has a sweeter taste to it. My local grocery store no longer carries it so I was ecstatic to see it available on Amazon and in bulk! =D,5
B004JRKEH4,Not a bad sauce but there does seem to be something I cannot quite pinpoint that seems to be missing in spice.  It is unexpectedly mild for a chipotle-based condiment giving the impression that it is a bit dull.  Spice is a matter of taste perhaps but I suspect this will be less than most would expect.  It may solve the problem of disguising leftovers once in a while but it is certainly nothing to get excited about.,3

B000084ETV,"New food and or changed formula's need to be introduced to animals slowly. Very slowly. However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way, what WAS wrong with the old formula????",1
B0058AMY74,I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain!

The beans were very dry.. no oily shine that I was used to.<br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find a very mild, dry bean.  If you do buy this, plan on grinding it to ""expresso"" grind to get a hint of Costa Rican coffee.<br />The coffee by itself is okay... just not what I was hoping for.",3

No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.",1

It lacks that sickly sweet taste that soda with high fructose corn syrup tends to have, which is a bonus.<br /><br />This can at 8.3 oz is following the `skinny can' trend, as well, which I think is great for packing in a cooler, your bag, or a picnic basket.

B0002DGRPC,"These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently.

B001E8J2RY,"I really, really do not like this gum. It might be gluten free and ""natural"", but it tastes disgusting. The peppermint flavor only seems to be in the outer candy shell of the gum. So you chew and break the shell, then swallow that part and then the taste is gone. The taste only lasts about the time it takes to chew up a Tic Tac and swallow it and doesn't leave the pleasant aftertaste a Tic Tac does. Then after that candy shell is gone, to me at least, it tastes like chewing on a wood chip and is almost as hard. I can't stand chewing it even as long as minute. I think I might get more out of chewing on ice. Sorry, I really tried to like this, but I'm taking a pass on this brand of gum.",1
B005NS6LRK,I was excited to try these flavors but I cannot tell any difference between the toasted marshmallow and the salted caramel.  They both just taste like any regular pack of plain hot cocoa mix you can get in the grocery store.  Only thing is these are more expensive and cost more to make since you must use milk.  Won't waste my money again.  I'll stick with melting chocolate chips into milk if I want a really rich/decadent hot chocolate.,2

B0016J7SYU,"Pros:  flax seeds, organic, fiber, pumpkin seeds, taste!<br />Cons:  price<br /><br />Yum.  I used to avoid granola cereals because they were hard to chew.  A friend visited, brought a box of Nature's Path Pumpkin Flax Granola, and forgot to take it when he left.  So, I tried it.  I was hooked immediately.  Not only was it tasty, but it wasn't jaw-breaking hard.  It wasn't mush either.  Perfection.<br /><br />The only problem with this cereal is the price.  For someone on a fixed income trying to eat right, it's expensive.  It is hard to find it for less than $4-5/box and that's just too much for me to spend on a small box of cereal.  I bought this bulk package from Amazon when it was on a super sale, but on accident I didn't hit auto renew and the price went back up.  When it goes back down I'll renew, but until then it's other places that are cheaper.  These are Fred Meyer in bulk and Trader Joe's ($2.89/box).  The best price is Fred Meyer.<br /><br />Make sure that you chew the cereal good.  The flax seeds are whole.  If they enter the body whole, they EXIT whole as well, and that means you get zero nutrient from them.  So, chew it up!<br /><br />It's EXCELLENT with So Delicious Coconut Milk, a non-dairy, non-soy drink.  I just use it for this cereal.  I have stomach problems and this combo is one of the few things during the day that doesn't ache me.",5

But compared to other instant noodle soups, Annie Chun's is light years ahead.<br /><br />The noodles are soft and moist in the package - not fried and dried. The sauce is liquid and just oily enough. And there is a healthy packet of dehydrated veggies. The instructions do involve giving the noodles a soak and then draining. This can be a hassle where the best you can manage at work is to heat a mug of water in the microwave. I'm going to have to drain the noodles in the bathroom. Yech...

B002JX7GVM,"This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.",2
B000LKXG8W,My husband and I love this!  I usually caramelize Walla Walla sweet onions to mix in the cooked product.  We have also added sauteed zucchini and chopped fresh tomatoes.

B0055TCURC,"Peanut Butter & Jelly is comforting isn't it?  Something about that mix can bring you back to your childhood or make you think of comfort food.  Sadly, this bar isn't quite what I expected, but it still has it's good points.<br /><br />I like the Larabars, they can be quite delicious.  That being said, I think I've discovered that the ones not involving fruit (i.e. peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) are not as good tasting.  This one, I did like the taste of cherries that was in it, and the touch of salt.  But the peanut flavor just wasn't as good.  It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but it didn't really taste peanutty either.  Just an average mix of flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar are very good though.  There's only four.  Dates, peanuts, cherries and sea salt.  That's it.  Which is incredible.  I like foods like that that only have a few ingredients and nothing overly processed.  The bar has 210 calories.  So it's not a light snack.  This is better for while you are exercising or as a meal replacement.  I had it as breakfast and it worked just fine at filling me up.  There is 10 grams of fat in the bar and 19 grams of sugar.  So like I said before, not a light snack by any means.  It does have 4 grams of fiber though, so that's healthy.  And there's a little bit of natural vitamins in there from the fruit.  Protein is 6 grams, which isn't huge, but isn't bad for after you've been running (or before!).<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get this flavor again.  I'll stick to the all fruit bars I think when it comes to the Larabars.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",3
B002N7FSP0,"The bars are a good quality.  The flavor is good, but not as fruity as I thought it would be.  It is a very berry flavor, like the box says.  That's not a bad thing; it's just not as sweet as I anticipated.  The bars looked a little small, but they're dense.  The density makes up for the size of the bars as far as being an effective snack, but I found them kind of hard to chew.  I might try other flavors by this brand, but I probably won't buy the wildberry flavor again.",3

B001HTI5SW,"Well, they ARE crunchy--except for the seeds that are so hard they don't crunch. And maybe they are healthy, but I do not find the taste attractive.  It's not bad, for sticks and twigs, but I prefer more flavor, in this case, more salt.  Maybe some garlic to bring out the grain flavors?  These really remind me of some of the organic snacks in the 70's--you eat them because they are good for you, but you'd really rather have something else.  I'll stick to Beanitos.",2

B004FELBH8,"Newtons Fruit Thins are half amazing, half awful! The Fig & Honey flavor have an amazing scent of fresh baked oatmeal cookies. Each cookie is a thin round wafer, crispy and almost like a shortbread. Three cookies, a nice portion, is 140 calories.

I was relieved to realize that I hadn't, it was just the fruit bits. To be sure that I hadn't gotten just a bad cookie, I tried two more cookies. Again, I found the flavor to be wonderful, but I couldn't get beyond the texture of the pieces of fig.<br /><br />To be sure that my impression was accurate, I did ask a few family members to give me their opinion.

I compared it with similar bar from Trader Joe's with the same 54% cocoa, although the Trader Joe's bar is a huge one pounder. The Newman's bar was slightly smoother, perhaps just a little more waxy and sweeter. Big plus for Newman's Own is that it is organic and rainforest alliance certified.  Next, I'll need to move up to the next level of dark from Newman's Own. Maybe that will be the perfect bar for me.

B001LG940E,"Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />Prior to trying this, I enjoyed both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">kiwi berry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> flavors. Those were good on their own and decent with a pastry, but black cherry is a different case. First of all, it smells like grape, perhaps white grape. Secondly, it tastes like a flat cherry soda or a carbonated cough medicine. And honestly, I taste a hint tomato soup in there. Try it for yourself! It's an OK flavor, but not as great as I expected.

Second time around, same circumstances, one still loved it but the others felt tired / shaky / nauseous and frankly looked quite pasty-faced.  Tried a half bottle for those two, for the third time around, and they felt no effect at all (good or bad).  All three times, they had orange flavor and they did not down it on empty stomachs.  So now two don't want to use it any more and one is still interested.  Results definitely vary, therefore, but I'd recommend newbies to try it several times in non-critical situations before you decide to down it to prep for that truly vital meeting.",3

B004HK7NTA,"After a large price increase of the WestSoy unsweetened soymilk we started using the Organic Unsweetened Silk Soymilk, which we liked. Yet, today I was comparing the Silk to a soymilk I picked up in an Asian market, and saw that the Silk contains carrageenan, which is a thickener made from red seaweed. I also get a health newsletter that is one of the best from a Russell L. Blaylock, M.D., called ""The Blaylock Wellness Report"" [...]. One of his issues is on the dangers of inflammation. One of the food ingredients that is one of the worst cause of inflammation is carrageenan. Here's what he says about carrageenan:<br /><br />""To emphasize the importance of inflammation in cancer growth and spread, a number of studies have shown that carrageenan -- a common food additive made from seaweed and found in products as varied as ice cream, beer, and toothpaste -- can induce intense inflammation when injected into animal tissues.""<br /><br />""In fact, it is used in studies of inflammation. Even diluted solutions of carrageenan injected close to an existing tumor cause the cancer to begin to grow very rapidly. It spreads to other tissues much faster than it would have without the carrageenan.""<br /><br />""Another often-forgotten factor is the high amounts of excitotoxin food additives in the typical Western diet. This includes MSG (monosodium glutamate), hydrolyzed proteins, aspartame, soy protein concentrate and isolate, casienate, autolyzed yeast, yeast extract, natural flavoring, broth, stock and carrageenan -- all disguised names for high glutamate food additives, and all of them are allowed by the government.""<br /><br />I called the company that makes Silk Soy, and they claim that because their carrageenan is food grade and approved by the FDA, it is therefore safe. Food grade or not, if carrageenan is bad for you, then it is bad for you whether food grade or not. I say, why take a chance?<br /><br />In addition, they add salt as an ingredient. Why? Salt isn't needed in this soy. Or at least produce a version that doesn't have the salt, or for that matter the carrageenan as well. I'll be going back to the Westsoy unsweetened organic.",1

B000M5NKUK,I applied this rub onto a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I smoked it for 10 hours the next day and the meat turned out fabulously. The rub gave a definite spice to the shoulder but I found it heavy on the paprika and somewhat sour with an after-taste. The ingredients were very straightforward and pretty much what you find in almost all of the rub recipes online but I think I'd prefer a little sweetness to complement the meat.  Next time I'll try mixing my own spices but it'd be handier to have everything pre-mixed.,2

B001BDDTB2,"I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites.",4
B003H7KTKY,I usually buy loose leaf Taylors Darjeeling tea.  However I can no longer find Taylors loose leaf Darjeeling tea and was told hat Taylors no longer sells it.  I have searched all over and this seems to be the case so when i saw taylors darjeeling in the tea bag form i bought it since i will not be able to buy it in the future.  This is the same tea as loose only in bag form.  i hope this remains available in the future. I have not found a darjeeling tea in loose leaf that compares to the darjeeling tea that taylors sold in the past.,4

B001BDDTB2,"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.",1

Now he has open sores all over his body from biting his own skin. After some research, there seems to be a bunch of cats who have had skin allergies erupt after being on this food for a while.<br /><br />Edit: It was probably not fair to have given this food a 2 star review initially. Why? Because the ingredient list seems to be good and it was probably my cat who was just allergic to this food. I do find it odd however, that many cats seem to get sick from this food after some time on it. It makes me wonder if there is some ingredient that is being used in excess.",3

I didn't notice anything. First thing i tried was a grape. I mean this was the most delicious grape I had ever tasted. I started try all the fruits and sodas i could. Amazing. People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade. I wouldn't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue. Not your stomach. When you buy these you run the risk that it won't work, but it probably will. Very pleased.",5

B000F4DKBC,"My wife is Indian and loves Chai tea, but we're busy people and it takes a long time to make it properly. She has tried the following:<br /><br />  1.

Oregon Chai (powder and liquid)<br />  5. Some other Chai powder that Costco had a few years ago but I don't remember the name now.<br /><br />Except for #1 (which is crazy expensive at >$[...] a cup), the rest have been lackluster. But then she found Twinings Indian Spiced Chai Tea which is exactly what she was looking for, but you can't find it in every grocery store.<br /><br />Follow the instructions (1/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup water, 2 tsp sugar, tea bag) and you'll make a perfect cup every time, at like 1/20th the price of Starbucks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now that they have changed the product from ""Indian Spiced Chai"" to just ""Chai"", it is nowhere as good.

Granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags, there are more than enough instructions to go by.",5

B001EQ4JS8,"This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea- nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang-y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.<br /><br />I recommend brewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12-16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you overbrew (particularly Adagio's teas), there's a chance for bitterness, so I would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time.<br /><br />Another recommendation is Adagio's Irish Breakfast (which I slightly prefer) but both teas are standouts!",5
B001EQ5EQE,I've always enjoyed the decaf at a little Italian restaurant in our downtown area.  I noticed that their affiliated deli sold LavAzza and I asked if that is what they brewed for the restaurant and was told yes.  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered and I am not sorry.  What a great price for an excellent cup of coffee!  Now I get the restaurant flavor without spending the restaurant price!,5
B000DZFMEQ,"A kind friend bought a six pack of these for us to try out. My pre teen has Celiac and our kitchen is GF and we are always willing to try out different GF items. Our current bread standby is from Glutino and, while it is not perfect, my kids enjoy it - especially when used to make french toast!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4"">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The first four packs I made I followed to the letter. I was a little disappointed that the instructions on the back for using the bread mix for oven baked bread, bagels, pizza dough, cinnamon bread and egg free bread all stated in large bold lettering that it required the use of a heavy duty stand mixer. I don't have one and so those options were out for me.  But still, using the recipe for breadmakers turned out decent (if fairly flat) loaves. I made the basic recipe and the sweet bread. The instructions state that you should make this on a Basic White bread setting instead of the Gluten free setting on your breadmaker and that is what I did.<br /><br />(Note that if you are buying this mix to bake in your oven, the package states that you need to use a stand mixer!)<br /><br />My child said that the bread was okay but that it had a wierd texture and taste to it. I think the texture was due to the grainy nature of the 3 rice flours in the mix. The flavor, I think, is the Millet flour which tends to have a bitter aftertaste. Millet does have good nutritional value but if the flavor turns off the child from eating it what is the point??<br /><br />Anyway, I still had two packs to go so I decided to tweak things a little. I made the sweet bread recipe again but this time I used butter instead of oil and baked it in my Zojirushi breadmaker on a programmed gluten free program and Voila! The bread rose beautifully! It had a light airy feel to it; a bit spongy - almost like a cake. The 1/4 cup sugar covered up the bitterness of the millet, home made butter (could use unsalted) instead of the melted oil made it rich - and it tastes almost exactly like Challah bread!<br /><br />So if you are just GF and not CF as well, this is a sure fire way to make some excellent sweet egg bread.  And if, like us, you miss your Shabbat Challah, this bread mix will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen!",4

The taste is perfectly ok, although I wouldn't be sorry if it had an even more chocolatey flavor. It's nice and moist, which my old standby, powerbars are not... Each bar is filling and satisfies hunger pangs. I wish a single bar wasn't so calorie dense, but that's probably due to all the nutty goodness, which is what provides the sustaining energy. So as long as one doesn't eat them by twos and threes, it's probably all good.",3

The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort.

Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted.

B000PDY3P0,I believe that this product is old/expired or being stored incorrectly.  Only about half the kernels popped and the kernels that did pop had an odd chewy/stale texture to them.  I would not recommend buying from this company.,2
B008YGWIZM,"So I have sampled and bought my fair share of Everidae sauce and I have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.<br /><br />I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.<br />I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.<br /><br />The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).  But this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water.",5
B002Z95BOY,I've tried a few different coconut juice drinks and have really enjoyed most of them but this one just isn't for me.  The lime is over powering.  Works okay for cooking with or mixing drinks but not so much by itself.,3
B001E77LT6,"Totally agree with the Nutri-Not reviewer above. If you are going to have candy or cake, this is better choice but just as artificial just slightly more fiber which is minimal for a healthy choice anyway. better to eat real fruit, but like i said, good for snack but not healthy. I eat the strawberry ones and I noticed blood on my toilet paper from wiping my behind almost every time I had some. That is not a good sign. Entenmans has similar fruit bars that are a couple calories less and you don't taste all that salt like you do with these. I am switching back.",2
B007M83302,"We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.<br /><br />But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste.",4
B000ETAJZ8,THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.<br /><br />SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.<br /><br />FOR ME I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.........,1
B004K30HO2,I have tried another brand of one cup coffee making.  These made the job easy and no mess.  The other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket.  You disposed of the inserted paper basket only.  The plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least.  Then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have escaped.,5
B004JRKEH4,"My family and friends tried this. Unfortunately no one seems to agree to buy this again. This is too spicy for most of kids. Some complained it tastes a bit artificial and less natural. Others claim is is a bit too heavy. Of course, each one has its taste, and we are a small sample, but even so our small feedback is not that positive on this one.",3
B001CD1VI4,"I love the mix of flavors in this cookie.  The cookies are very moist and they are also very filling. The only thing I didn't like about these is the strong nutmeg taste.  Unfortunately, nutmeg is not my favorite spice.  I would have enjoyed more raisins but my kids are glad there aren't that many.  I love the fact that I can keep these handy for mornings when we are running late and for when we take trips.  They are easy to freeze and seem to keep rather well in the freezer.",4
B004JRKEH4,"My 18 yr old son thinks Taco Bell is ok and said this sauce is very much like what you get when you go to Taco Bell. My wife thought it too spicy, but she is not a fan of spicy foods. I thought it was ok - a bit like 1,000 island dressing with a slight kick - not quite as sweet. It also reminded me a bit of the dip you get when you go to Outback and get their bloomin onions.<br /><br />It did not 'wow' any of us, we'll use it until it is gone, but no plans to buy more. Since other reviewers have gone to great lengths to list the ingredients, nutitional information, etc I will not duplicate their work.<br /><br />This is glueten free, so that is a +",3
B000KV61FC,"So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle.",2

B002NHYQAS,"A good, not too sweet dark chocolate bar that reminds me of Hershey's Special Dark bar. The difference being that Newman's has less of an after taste. But the biggest difference is that Newman's Own donates 100% of its profits to human services, health, education, arts, and cultural organizations including Hole In The Wall Camps for seriously ill children. On top of a decent organic chocolate bar, you are making the world a little better place. Wonderful.",4
B001E5E268,Good wake up tea.  Solid flavor.  Requires a fine strain on your tea cup.  It's a fine cut of tea and will get bitter if you overbrew.,4
B0093A5XC8,"When I opened the pouch and sniffed I was very pleased because it smelled spicy, but also richly creamy-pumpkin. But you often can't tell what something is going to taste like from its dry smell, and that seems to be the case here. For this first tasting I prepared the matcha with just hot water (then added a little sugar later). I got almost no froth when whisking this one, which has to be an effect of the flavoring somehow. It smelled very clovey when prepared, that really is the dominant aroma.<br /><br />The flavor of the matcha when prepared straight is pretty subtle, but improved when sugar is added. When is really shines, however, is in latte form.  The thing about pumpkin pie is that it's creamy and sweet, so adding more creamy and sweet elements really brings out the pumpkin pie flavor. I will definitely really enjoy drinking it this way this fall.",4
B0081XIA1E,I bought this product to keep my boxer entertained. She is very food motivated and very smart. The problem is that she tries to get the food out by any means necessary. This results in her being very ruff on the toy. I had to take it away for fear that she would break it.,1
B000ER6YO0,"Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over!

B004L5UC0I,"I bought a bag of this for 3 dollars and 50 cents at WalMart. I hadn't seen it before. The jerky softness is medium. The taste is like a jerky stick. It's not amazing in flavor or tenderness but it's very edible and still delicious. This doesn't have a real salty flavor some brands do and it doesn't have a very smoky flavor either. It's good to see a little bag of mid-priced jerky. Most jerky here is $4.50-$9 a package.<br /><br />My favorite jerky that's the most tender and has the best taste is made by a company in Sonoma, California called Krave Jerky. That company's Basil Citrus jerky is the best I've ever had!!<br /><br />Matador jerky is 3 stars.",3

B004JRKEH4,"I was sent one bottle of Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce to review for the Amazon Vine Program. Here's my take on it:<br /><br />Listed as a ""Home Originals"" bold and creamy chipotle sauce for use on tacos, Mexican salads, and sandwich wraps or as a dip, I first tried it out on Doritos, then on a taco. It's creamy, more a cross between mayonnaise and sour cream, but I'd hardly call it bold. Yes, there's a slight chipotle taste and a bit of bite, but otherwise, it's pretty bland. I'm, no doubt, prejudiced, because I regularly make my own chipotle crema sauce which is extraordinarily good and easy. So, I was expecting a sauce with a bit more chipotle taste. The inclusion of buttermilk in the sauce imparts a slight cheese taste, not a good thing, and it's not at all smoky as chipotle should be. Also, it has a very bright color that seems enhanced.<br /><br />If you're a reader of labels, know that each two tablespoon serving contains 110 calories, 11g total fat, 1.5g saturated fat, and 300mg sodium.<br /><br />I was happy to try this sauce but will probably stick with my home made version which is decidedly more flavorful and robust.",3

B0016889C6,"I've been on a ginger ale kick lately and switched to diet since every brand of regular ginger ale I can find sweetens their drinks with high fructose corn syrup instead of just regular sugar. Anything made with or from corn makes me ill, so I've been drinking. I've had the diet Canada Dry version, as well as various store brands from Brookshire's, Albertson's, etc. I ran to the grocery store near work today to pick up something and grabbed a six-pack of Vernors as there were no other options for diet ginger ale.<br /><br />The after-taste is almost like saccharine, even though it is sweetened with Aspertame. It is reminiscent of TAB soda. The taste of ginger ale is there, but there is a chemical-esque taste as well - almost soapy.<br /><br />I won't be getting this brand ever again.",2
B0041NYV8E,"I really don't know what to compare with this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon drink, which will adequately describe the flavor profile I'm getting when tried at full strength per the package directions.  The aftertaste of cough drops, perhaps, or that chemical/sodium taste you get as a minor note with club soda, only -- unfortunately -- amplified.<br /><br />Dry ginger granules can't really be expected to taste ""fresh"" - and indeed the Gold Kili ginger calls to mind the kind you'd buy to make pumpkin pie.  Now, I expect I've savored plenty of chai teas that had ginger powder in the spice base.  So after determining that full-strength Gold Kili was too strong for me, I decided to try it as a drink add-in, mixing it with a quart of tea from the fridge.  It wasn't bad...except for that chemical aftertaste again.  Rats.<br /><br />1.5 stars, rounded up -- recognizing the convenience of the product and the fact that tastes do vary.",2

Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food.

B0032RPLSY,"This organic, grass-fed ghee embodies everything that a modern, healthful food should be. It is tasty, healthful, fresh, and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages-old methods and principles.<br /><br />I began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy, home-cooked foods. More recently, I participated in an Ayurvedic cleanse that required that I take 1/4 cup of plain, warm ghee for several mornings straight! Though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality, the Pure Indian Foods ghee was truly delicious. The flavor is clean and sweet, without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees (even those labelled as organic). And not a hint of rancidity, to which I'm very sensitive.<br /><br />Only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee, which is unusual and extremely beneficial.

B003EM7J9Q,"I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.<br /><br />First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. ""Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding""....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness.",3
B005GX6G9K,"Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach.",1
B002ZOCEOY,"While opening the package, it bugged me that the label is prominently labelled ""ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED,"" in a manner that is not immediately noticeable on the website.<br /><br />I am the type of person who remains always aware of such labeling, even as I savor the coffee (which I do). I remain uncomfortably aware that its flavor profile was partially concocted by a food scientist in a lab, using unknown chemicals that I may not be able to pronounce.<br /><br />The ""artificial flavor"" scarlet letter is something most modern-day coffee outfits would jump through hoops to avoid -- and reasonably so, because labelling creates a genuine psychological component of any product.<br /><br />Not so fussy are the 8 O'Clock people (spun-off from the great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, now owned by Tata Coffee, a tea & coffee plantation giant headquartered in India, though their 8 O'C executives still HQ in  Montvale, NJ).<br /><br />While my enjoyment of this brew would be greater without the ""artificial"" label, I'm sufficiently happy with the flavor and the price that I will certainly allow my subscription to stand, though I will continue to sample other, all-natural brands.<br /><br />Another reviewer takes this coffee over the coals, contending that it tastes like a stevia-sweetened candy bar. I have to wonder what he's using to sweeten his brew, as my taste buds detect no such similarity...I suspect that this reviewer is even more neurotic about the ""artificial"" label than I, and he's tasting the labelling more than he is tasting the coffee.",4

You might be surprised by its much firmer texture (than popcorn) at first, but go through a couple, and if you're like me, you'll appreciate the quality crunch and just the right balance of sea salt! I was hooked so fast, I was just chugging the ziplock bag into my mouth for a mouthful of tasty treat, and no, didn't need to reseal the pouch! The spicy version is just as good - it isn't that spicy (it's ""slightly spicy"") and highly addictive. Try both and you will not go back to those greasy popcorns! Yay for Grandpa Po's!",5

B001ET5XWQ,"I purchased this coffee because of the claims on the packaging that the beans were picked with integrity and with fair practices. I always look for these traits in my coffee, as well as look for organically grown beans. I also always purchase decaf and love strong, dark roasted coffees. So, I brewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high-end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I brewed it the same as I always brew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole brewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to bring this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put-downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored. I will never buy this coffee again and want to spread the word to my family and friends to stay away from this coffee as well based on my experience.",1

This product had caused my teeth to become infected and I ended up going an Urgent Care for pain meds and amoxicillin. Looking closely at the ingredients the top two are EVAPORATED CANE JUICE and TAPIOCA SYRUP. Jelly Belly is a candy company not into sports nutrition and that's what this product is.

They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.

B001BDDTB2,"Yes, they should call it ""Cat Crack"". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies.

B001G0N5RS,"First, let me say that this ginger is from China, and any food from China concerns me.<br /><br />I have eaten about 30 bottles of this ginger.  It is different from the pickled ginger (gari) that you will get in most restaurants.  It seems to have been pickled for a shorter time, and it is definitely crunchier than restaurant ginger.  Also, it is hotter and less sweet, and the slices are thicker.  Nonetheless, when I eat it with sushi, I like the hotter taste because it is more flavorful (ginger is naturally hot).  When I first tried bottled gari 20 years ago, it was absolutely horrible, so I know how much worse this ginger could be.  A lot of people don't know that gari is not supposed to be eaten with sushi; it is supposed to be eaten between courses of a meal to cleanse the palate.  But I prefer to eat my ginger with sushi, and the more intense flavor suits me.  However, if I were eating it between courses, I would want a milder, sweeter ginger.<br /><br />The first bottles of Roland ginger that I ate were from a discount store, and they were a little old.  They had a slight off-flavor.  By the time I ate the last bottle (a year after I got them), the inner plastic seal disintegrated as I removed it, so you can't let this ginger sit around indefinitely.  Indeed, I think that the vinegar probably caused the plastic seal to degrade faster than it would have.  The fresher bottles that I got from Amazon have a fresher flavor, and it is definitely good enough to eat with sushi.  Unless you are prepared to make your own gari, I recommend it (although I haven't tried any other brands).<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about the thicker slices.  Restaurant ginger is sliced very thin and is limp, this ginger is sliced thicker and is firm and crunchy.  The thicker slices may be one of the reasons it is hotter, since the vinegar may not penetrate the thicker slices as well.  I had no objection to the thicker slices until I opened a bottle and found slices up to 2mm thick -- that's definitely too thick.  But for the most part, I don't mind the thicker, stiffer, crunchier, hotter qualities of this ginger.  This ginger is a little closer to being raw than restaurant ginger is, but it's good enough to eat with sushi.<br /><br />The vinegar leaked out of one of the bottles during my second shipment from Amazon, and the vinegar soaked the cardboard box.  I didn't have rice vinegar, so I replaced the vinegar with water, and the ginger tasted okay.  When I got my third shipment (on Oct. 21st), I found that the bottles were sealed in a plastic bag.  None of them leaked; but if they had, the plastic bag should have caught the liquid.  I have now received 40 bottles from Amazon, and only one leaked.",3

B003VXFK44,"The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol",3

I used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker.<br /><br />While I was enjoying the coffee, I read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water. That got my curiosity up so I measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon. Since I use two heaping scoops, that's slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package. Following the directions would probably make a watery, undrinkable brew.<br /><br />The coffee has a nice even espresso grind, perhaps a bit lighter than a French roast. I would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but Melitta states that it is an all-arabica blend from Central and South America. It is decaffeinated through the chemical-free Swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Also note the cute vintage travel poster-style label and the clever name: because it's decaffeinated, it's perfect to drink while watching the sunset.",4

The only treat he has patience with licking is a little cup of  doggie ice cream.  Even ice cubes he will crunch instead of lick.  I was also a little bit bothered by the smell of the product; there was an oily odor to it.  This treat may work for little dogs or dogs who have more patience but sadly not my dog.  It is a good effor though.",3

B000FK63IS,"The reviews were so good I just had to try this - and the result was the usual fat cold noodles tasting like rice (i.e., nothing much).  Tinkyada isn't any worse than any of the others - but I find the thickness of conventional spaghetti makes the rice taste much more noticeable.  Take this with a grain of salt, since I preferred vermicelli even before I went on a gluten-free diet (about 15 years ago), but to me, vermicelli works a lot better than conventional spaghetti, because it's thinner, making the taste (or lack thereof) less noticeable when coated with sauce.  People not on the diet notice the pasta when I use rice spaghetti, but no one has ever found fault with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLXSS"">Ener-G Foods Rice Vermicelli, 10.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I used to use, or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS"">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> (more like linguini) I've been using in place of spaghetti recently.  I still buy the Tinkyada spaghetti to use in soups - fine for chicken noodle soup, etc. - but am going back to the above products that I've been using quite happily as spaghetti for years.  Not only is the rice taste less noticeable, but the vermicelli cooks in 4 minutes or so - 1/3 the time it takes to cook Tinkyada spaghetti.  (Given my attention span, this also makes it easier for me not to forget and overcook it into a gooey mess.)",3

B0016FY6H6,"I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.",5

B001BTYAFU,"For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5Â¢ apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine.",5

I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!<br /><br />I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even brought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought ""buffalo"" flavors don't accomplish that.<br /><br />As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.

I was just a few clicks away from purchasing this here, and decided to do a quick check on the website which is where I will buy it until the price is equal here.  Just to be clear, if it was just the soda I would give it 5-stars, but because the price is essentially doubled, I am driving the point home that the pricing is outrageous and hopefully giving it 1-star will get people to read this.",1
B000LKZ84C,"I use this product frequently.  Like most tofu, you need to press it (between paper towels with a heavy skillet on top works fine) to get the excess water out.  The more water you can remove, the less you'll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking, something the previous reviewer did not like.<br /><br />As for a blank slate on taste, that's exactly what makes tofu great.  It will take on any flavor you want to impart.  Our most common marinade is placing the pressed, cubed tofu in a Ziploc with a mix of soy, honey, and lemon or lime juice.  A quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas (many also include minced garlic, ginger, etc).  You can also purchase a premade marinade, like a teriyaki sauce.  The more liquid the marinade (and the more water removed from pressing), the better it will penetrate the tofu.  Even a half hour in the bag works fine.<br /><br />We saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies (add tofu last--it just needs to get warm; or, for a firmer style, you can bake or ""brown"" it separately first) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce (you can thicken with cornstarch if desired).  Handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats, but broken up pieces taste just fine too.<br /><br />Marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill.<br /><br />Plain tofu ""creams"" well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness.  We've made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs.<br /><br />We have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a General Tso recipe.  General Tso's Tofu is AWESOME.  The flavor comes from the sauce so you don't need to marinate first.<br /><br />Some people also freeze tofu--generally remove from packaging and press first--to give it a firmer consistency.<br /><br />Tofu is all about how you prepare it.  Most people will NOT like it plain, so don't expect to just dig a fork into it.<br /><br />This particluar product is great because of its all-purpose nature (firm is definitely better than soft for saute, etc) and its shelf life.  I would have given it five stars but the must-be-refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer.  They don't last as long in the house, though, so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry (usually dated a few to several months out).",4

I've also tastes olive oils that claim all sorts of awards that have made me have a coughing fit from their pepperiness. Here's what I think: it's all about the flavor, and Mt.

B000H26J7E,"Well, once again a great product has been cheapened in the name of ""American taste"".  I find it hard to believe that anyone would prefer this ""new"" recipe that Lindt is using for its Chocolate sold in the USA.  I should of known something was up because I noticed that the Lindt bars were on sale for far too long at the supermarket.  That is often a sign of a product being cheapened some time after an acquisition from a conglomerate or private equity company; Kettle chips come to mind.<br /><br />Those who were previously in charge of marketing and merchandising Lindt bars in the USA had to know that their market was a little more upscale and refined than those who consume a Hershey or a Reeses.  I bet some new (American) management got involved.  That ""market taste test"" someone referred to is mostly BS; they already knew that Americans in general have unsophisticated child like tastes, that pander to the overly sweet, artificial and creamy.  Sweet artificial and creamy pretty much sums up American food with the exception of meats.  However in the case of meats sweet artificial sauces and fake smoke flavor abound for ""dipping""; Americans love their finger dipping food!  Coming off the diatribe, it is clear that Lindt is now more interested in competing with Hershey for the taste of the ""average joe"".  After all it costs less to produce chocolate for their taste.  So the gamble is this; will they profit more by making a cheaper bar and competing against Hershey for the taste of Joe average or by keeping their quality high and catering to those who know better?  American management is notorious for pursuing the ""quick money"", and I know this is a pretty audacious assumption but i bet that Lindt hired on a few Americans to run local manufacturing / Marketing and this change is being conducted at their behest.  Short term, these American managers look good (the quick win) because they lowered their cost basis by decreasing production cost.  Long term, American management mostly moved on and Lindt is now a cheapened brand that just barely survives (in the USA) competing with the likes of Hershey.  We shall see, but I will not buy another Lindt product while Stateside.<br /><br />Can anyone advise of an alternative European dark chocolate bar (70-90%) that is reasonably priced and available in the States.

VERY high praise from my husband, seeing as he doesn't even like coffee.<br /><br />But I do, and while this had a richer flavor than I was expecting, I am not a huge fan of the aftertaste.<br /><br />I am no espresso connoisseur, in fact that only espresso I have ever had is Starbucks, so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to, but I do like strong coffee.  A slightly bitter taste is actually something I enjoy, as opposed to overly sweetened coffee that seem to be the rage.  This little can (6.8 FL OZ) certainly has that.  It has a surprisingly bitter taste with just the right amount of sweetness.  At 50 calories a can, it's relatively diet friendly too.<br /><br />But there, at least for me, was something of a strange film in my mouth.  Not a big deal, but at almost $2 per can ($22.93 for 12) I expect to like it much more than I did.  If I was running errands and really wanted some iced coffee, I might consider this, but at home I will stick with my own brew.",3

B001EQ5L0I,"I have been a connoisseur of quality green, oolong for many moons, and I also enjoy a good cup of morning Joe. I had tried loose Pu-erh previously and was bitten by the smooth coffee like mouth feel of the variety. This is not green tea taste be prepared, but is very earthy and rich especially during the first and second flushes. These nuggets of goodness have replaced my boring coffee routine. I prefer it strong and thick usually dropping two Tuo Cha nugs in my tea pot. I'm here to report the following; calm alertness, healthy as green and if you believe might help drop a few points on your disappointing cholesterol numbers  before your next visit.<br /><br />It's true......strong earthy aroma is apparent primarily during the first flush, but is very part of the brew process, brew is clear not cloudy and taste is never sharp or tannic.

As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular.",1
B0016FY6H6,"I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.  This is a nice, pleasant beverage. The flavor isn't too strong.  I add a packet of Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  The powder dissolves easily in cold water.  The flavor is natural not fake.  I was impressed enough with it that I have signed up for auto-delivery.",4
B001EQ55ZO,"I'm a big cashew fan, but was unimpressed by this product. The nuts were fresh, but the seasoning was a bit too heavy-handed - they are very salty and the pepper has more of a bite than I liked.<br /><br />The seasoning gets stronger the lower you get in the can due to it falling off the upper ones and coating the lower ones. While tolerable when first opened, the seasoning becomes way too overpowering once you get half-way down in the can. I found myself putting the nuts in a dish and rolling them around a bit to dislodge some of the seasoning.<br /><br />If you're on a sodium restricted diet (or just want to cut down on sodium) you definitely want to pass on this.<br /><br />If they would dial back the salt by 50% and the pepper by 75%, it would be a great product. As it is right now, however, I'll have to give it only 2 stars.",2
B000GZYAN2,"I'm not on a diet or anything, my husband just bought these because they were on sale at the local grocery store and was intrigued by the Just Add Yogurt label (we are huge yogurt eaters). These are pretty decent brownies: almost-normal consistency, fudge-y taste (batter was amazing!). But there is a slight odd after-taste (fruity? cocoa powder?), if you have sensitive taste buds and are used to the standard brownie. To get by that, just eat these with ice cream or whipped cream and strawberries. (Although that kind of defeats the purpose of the fat-free I guess). I probably won't buy these again just because I love regular ol' brownies. But these were fun to try.",3
B002IEZJMA,"Nice flavor- I would have preferred it slightly sweeter, but as some other reviewers have said it's too sweet, that's clearly a personal preference.<br /><br />While the convenience is great, for the price, I'd rather get an iced coffee (with actual ice!) from the local coffee place. The serving size is fairly small (basically the same size as half a can of soda- not much at all if you like coffee), as well. But the portability is pretty great- it'd be good for grabbing on a hurry or if you're headed out to a picnic or some sort of day out somewhere and need to bring coffee with you.",3

Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.",2
B000GZW9EY,I love raspberry and chocolate and was very excited to find a healthy alternative for my brownie fix. I was sorely disappointed in the taste.

B000HP7KEW,"Like the other reviewers the name IS deceiving. This is not the ""stick to your ribs"" bean soup Grandma made in the winter.

B0041NYV8E,"I just returned from Singapore and tried a really wonderful ginger tea.  I brought home two giant bags, I was so impressed, so when I saw this product, I gave it a try.  I can honestly say that there is simply no comparison.  Since I only received a packet as a sample, there were no directions on how much to use, but I had assumed it was one packet to a cup of water.  When I gave it a try, I thought it was going to burn a hole in my throat.  Although apparently mixed with honey and lemon, it only enhances the strength of the ginger.  I ended up dumping half the cup out and filling it with more water to see if it would create a more mellow flavor, but it only decreased the flavor while leaving the burning sensation in full strength.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I don't think the lemon is doing this tea any favors.  It simply ends up tasting medicinal, so if you're using it for digestive purposes, colds, and stomach cramping like most ginger teas are alleged to help, then it's probably the way to go, but if you're looking for a good tasting ginger tea with all the health benefits, I would pass on this one.",2
B00213ERI0,"I discovered these at my local Starbucks and loved them. The sugar cookies are wonderful, have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste. The easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste & remind me of Christmas sugar cookies. The chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite. It's so hard to find gluten-free snacks that taste great and don't leave you yearning for a "" real "" snack. Buy them !",5

Oh well, a guy can dream.<br /><br />Tastes pretty good if you close your eyes.",3
B001HX59ZU,"We found this at BJ's before I started shopping on Amazon.  My wife and I were disappointed with it after having tried the Twinings in the sample pack that came with our brewer.

B000HDOOL6,"I have been drinking this tea for years and am so disappointed that they change the formula. It has a terrible after taste, especially when it starts to cool just a little. I also enjoyed it cold over ice and now am not able to tolerate the taste cold. I purchased 2 - 6 pack boxes and now am stuck with this foul tasting tea. Unless the Oregon Chi company goes back to the original formula I will never purchase it again.",1

B002TMV3E4,"I usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week, more as an indulgence than as a necessity.  It's a sipping beverage for me, and flavor matters a lot.  That said, I add milk and sugar, so I'm not excessively picky (or I think so, at least).  So I'm always glad to find new ""gourmet"" blends to add to my list of favorites.<br /><br />This blend seemed promising, with a very nice aroma and a perfect, even grind.  I usually grind my own beans, but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as-is.  It even produced a rich, smooth crema.  Unfortunately, my first sip - without sugar or milk - was very bitter.  I ended up adding about a half-teaspoon more sugar than I usually use just to compensate.  Even then, the coffee flavor, itself, was thin and weak.  With just a little milk added, it tasted more like, well, flavored milk.<br /><br />This coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago.  Fine for that application, but not really what I'm looking for in rich, smooth flavor with low bitterness.",3
B001EW5YQS,"This device does one thing and it does it well. I use it to record demos and it provides a crisp, clean sound with zero noise! I have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle. While it feels a little chinsy, I hardly think it will snap in half. The price is right and the sound is great.<br /><br />For the most part, setting the icicle up is incredibly easy.

It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too.",2
B000KFXEYE,"I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.",1

The only better bulk price one can get (that I'm aware of) is at the Haribo factory in Bonn, Germany (and if you like Gummibaerchen, I suggest you visit).<br /><br />As for the candies themselves, Frogs are not my favorite.  An entire bag of them yields no variety at all.  If Amazon starts selling the classic bears (which are a multitude of flavors and are smaller and easier to chew up) I would buy those over Frogs in a hot second.  (The sugar-free kind are not the classic version, and some people have digestive problems with the artificial sweetener. NB this is not the case with Frogs - they are sugar-sweetened.)<br /><br />A note about the Haribo ""catchphrase"": the German ""Haribo macht Kinder froh und Erwachsene ebenso"" is better translated ""Haribo makes kids happy / and adults likewise"".

B000F9BCQ2,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample.",4

Again though, I haven't had any problems with my cat hurting his mouth or tongue on them, he chews them right up and begs for more. I must say though that the herring steaks are his favorite.",4

Nyquil knocks me out, I need 6-8 hours of free time to sleep with it so I didn't want to take my chances with this.  45 minutes after I finished the bottle I felt loopy and needed to sleep.  4 hours later I woke up with a massive head ache.  It knocked me out big time, but now I have a bad head ache.  I may keep a bottle in the fridge for a long night, but there's no way I would drink this on a regular basis, my head hurts way too much now.",2
B00170WH12,"The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to ""paint"" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.",2

Woo-hoo!. Might I add, you can change the frequency of that at any time.",5
B002RU3GH0,"I only give it a 4 because at times there is difficulty extracting the product from the small opening at times, but its perfectly suitable when the bottle is warmed by the surrounding temperature.<br /><br />I actually brought this particular product back with me from when I traveled around India.  It was the natural home moisturizer and beauty treatment there.  Ask any Indian woman how she has such long, strong beautiful hair and she'll tell you its because she conditions her hair and massages her scalp with coconut oil.  I'm not Indian but I'm a girl who has been trying to maintain long hair and suffering from split ends, but reluctant to trim too much and I admired the healthy state of their hair.<br /><br />Its a great moisturizer and also its healthy for you if you want to cook with, its very good for digestion and provides healthy saturated fats.  I know it sounds counter intuitive, but certainly do your own research and don't go against doctors orders.<br /><br />Don't go overboard with consumption or cooking with it, but I was informed having a tablespoon with each meal is beneficial, just be careful not to consume after your meal if you want weight loss.<br /><br />I personally use coconut as a hair conditioner, moisturizer, in place of butter and cooking oil.<br />I use Parachute for only beauty/moisturizing reasons because I find that the opening does not make it easy to extract the oil for cooking because half the year the temperature makes the oils solid and the opening is for the oil in a more liquid state.<br /><br />The coconut oil solidifies when the surrounding temperature is cooler.  This particular bottle makes it difficult to squeeze out if the temperature is too low.  I'd recommend placing the closed bottle it in a bowl of warm to hot water to help melt it a bit.<br /><br />This product is very inexpensive.  Avoid other products that are not 100% pure coconut oil.",4
B0045XE32E,"These were a gift for an English bulldog, who had no problem chomping them down. (I know other reviews said some dogs found them difficult.) As with anything ""Newman"" you pay a little more for the brand name, so the budget conscious buyer might choose an alternative, cheaper treat.

B000DZFMEQ,"I ordered this stuff in bulk, because the reviews looked so good, I had no doubt that it would be great.  Maybe I'm a little hard on it because I'm like a champion bread maker.  I was almost destroyed when I figured out gluten was causing my psoriasis.  My bread turned out mishapen and like a brick.  Just super heavy, and like week old regular bread.  Kinda crumbly.  It takes like an hour and a half to finish cooking on the inside.  I guess gluten free bread is so bad, that this is the best we could come up with.  I must say it had a nicer aroma than the other bread I tried, but I just am not impressed.  I'm going to bake another loaf, and pray that I did something wrong the first time.  I don't mean to be a ""debbie downer"", but if this is the very best out there, and I've heard that it is, I may just be giving up sandwiches all together!  I hope your bread turns out better than mine.  Is there a way to repost a review if my next loaf turns out great?  Oh well... just don't be surprised if your first loaf is a disaster, because I'm a kitchen queen, and it was no good.  P.S.  I'm vegan and had to use an egg substitute.

B002GJ9JWS,"Just as so many other reviewers have stated, PB2 is absolutely wonderful in shakes! Everyone has their own kind of shakes they make and for me, it's Slim-Fast + fat-free milk + 1 tbsp of PB2 + some ice in a blender. It is a great tasting chocolate peanut butter shake! I have not used the PB2 in other similar ways. I enjoy my shake so much though, that I will continue to buy the PB2 for it.<br /><br />That being said.. I mixed it to make it just like a peanut butter- 2 tbsp of powder + 1 tbsp of water. I spread it on an English muffin (I love an English muffin with peanut butter). Unlike other reviews, I have to say, that was not pleasant at all. The consistency was fine but I'd give up peanut butter altogether before doing that again. In my opinion, it was awful tasting and even made me sick to my stomach while I was eating it and for a while after I had finished.<br /><br />Even though I disliked the PB2 prepared with water, I still give it 4 stars because it is such a great mix-in and I will continue to make my chocolate peanut butter shakes with it. I will have to keep my natural Jif peanut butter though for sandwiches until there's a truly adequate/great tasting substitute. I've seen several dieticians and they have all said it's a good idea to fit in natural peanut butter into the diet for the healthy fats, but just don't overdo it. I've lost 20 lbs and still incorporated natural peanut butter into my diet, so it can be done (again, moderation).<br /><br />Nutrition: The nutrition is also why this product is so popular! With 1.5 grams of fat, 5 grams of carbs, 2 grams of Fiber and 5 grams of Protein, this is a great choice and it is diabetic friendly. :)",4

After the last visit to the vet, with surgery that cost 13 of his teeth, I have struggled to find him a food that he could eat, that he liked, and would maintain his weight, his energy level (very playful pooch!), AND be good for him. He doesn't like soft food, so it's been a real task.<br /><br />This food does it. It's not brittle or ""dusty"". It is shaped like pellets (almost like rabbit food) and breaks really easy.

B003ANFMY8,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

B002LANN56,"OK - So I haven't tasted this myself, and my dog can't type, so I can only go by my impressions of my dog's behavior.<br /><br />Ingredient-wise, it's nice to see that beef is number one, though one assumes that is only the red pieces. The others have ingredients some folks want to avoid in pet foods, but that's personal choice of course. I'd suggest closely reading the ingredient list to see if it suits your needs.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, there are a lot of calories in a serving, and that serving is only 28% protein: surprising if the first ingredient is meat, though understandable when you factor in the vegetable kibble. Again, these are all choices pet owners need to make for themselves.<br /><br />What it really comes down to in the end, assuming the issues above are acceptable, is how a dog likes it. In my case, our dog likes it quite a bit up to a point: she picks out the meaty bits and leaves the veggies behind. I suppose if we just left those bits there she'd eventually eat them, but that doesn't seem like a balanced way to feed her.<br /><br />So for us, obviously, this food simply won't work. What our dog eats she loves, but she avoids more than she enjoys.",3

B005HUVJYO,"I just opened the tiny pack and made a bowl of their miso soup.  The good things is that the tofu, green onion and seaweed arent small.  The taste is good with not a lot of salt content ---- 510 g.  However the little plastic box that houses the block of miso tends to crush up so you have to make sure when you take it out you get all the stuff that has fallen out. The other problem I had was that they say put block in bowl and add 160 ml of hot water.  Well I dont know how much that is so I just put in 8 ounces.  It is very mild and does have a good taste with nice bits of stuff. I gave it four stars because of the packaging (the block should have a cover) and it would be nice to know how much 160 ml is?<br /><br />UPDATE: It has been some time now and I still love this little package of miso soup.  I have learned to deal with the packaging.  I have this practically everyday.  My only other complaint is that the seaweed is huge, so I take some scissors and cut it up.<br /><br /> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ANYONE THAT CAN HELP ME -------------------?

B0041NYV8E,"I was anxious to try this item because I hoped the ginger would help quell my morning sickness.  The packet directions stated to mix the entire package with 250ml of water, or approximately 8.45 oz.  I used hot water and mixed up the drink.  I was a little nervous to try it, as it looked like muddy river water. The first sip wasn't so bad.  The lemon taste was nice, and not artificial tasting.  The ginger taste was ok at first, but left a ""hot"" after taste in my mouth.  The drink was very strong, so I poured the drink back into the water bottle that I had gotten the water out of, to ""water it down"" so that it wouldn't be so strong.  That improved it slightly, but the after taste of the ginger was still too hot for my taste.  Finally, I decided to put the bottle into the fridge to see if I would like it better cold.  Two hours later I pulled it out and shook it up (It still looked like river water to me)  and took a drink.  This time, the lemon flavor, which had been pleasant before, was completely overpowered by the ginger taste, which seemed to be even more ""hot"" and lasting than before.<br /><br />Needless to say, I did not finish the bottle, and I have no intention of buying more of this.  I felt that the lemon flavor was nice, and perhaps a ""plain"" lemon drink would be fine, but the ginger in this beverage was far to spicy for my taste.  I have no idea if this beverage would be beneficial for those suffering with nausea, because I was unable to finish one package.  In my opinion, it would only aggreavate the stomach of someone who is already feeling ill.",2

Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...",3
B007POT6RM,"Okay, I don't ever buy instant oatmeal like this, we buy bulk organic quick oats and add brown sugar. I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better.  For the most part this oatmeal lived up to my expectations.  I will admit that compared to other maple flavored brands I've tried this one was better, but still, I would not buy this again, and one of my daughters said she didn't like it and won't eat it again, glad I only got one box.  We use genuine maple syrup in our household, and even keep maple sugar for sprinkling on toast, so we are big maple fans, and I guess with genuine maple fans artificial flavor just doesn't cut it.  I even felt like it wasn't quite sweet enough even though it had more sugar in it than the Cinnamon and Spice flavor oatmeal.  Because it has better flavor than other brands of maple flavored oatmeal I've tried, I gave it a 3 stars, saying it was OK is about right.",3
B004P7V8VE,"I used to get these a few years back, and they were amazing. Now I've bought them a few times and they taste different, like they're now skimping on something. They taste really... dry, kinda plain. I have a feeling this recipe change had something to do with the fact that the flavor blasted ones are now available in the huge boxes. I'm sure they're wanting to save money on some ingredients when they're selling in bulk. Will not be buying again.",2

B001WAL1O6,"First, I would give this bulb 5 stars if the description was correct, and will happily change my rating if that is fixed! The problem is that these are not ""super mini"" bulbs. Earthmate does make a 2700K super mini bulb that is 4.6"" long, but the only 23W full-spectrum bulb they list, at 5"" long, is this one. (The actual model number for this bulb is E2357AE on their website, which matches the individual units of the 6-pack.)<br /><br />These bulbs are fairly pricey compared to the average 23 watt full-spectrum bulb, and I paid the extra money partially based on the assumption that these would be smaller.<br /><br />Now, on to actually reviewing the product! The bulbs are average sized, and should fit in most lamps and fixtures; however, I did have one fixture where they were just a bit too long to fit. The brightness and coloration are excellent; they seem to put out a bit more light than other 23W full-spectrum bulbs I have. The CRI is 88; not the highest around but very good. The light is extremely close to my ALZO bulbs, which are still my favorite full-spectrum bulbs (other than the fact that they're huge and don't fit in most things!) The bulbs turn on to a fairly decent brightness and fully warm up very quickly. I've noticed zero buzzing or flickering.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are the best 23W full-spectrum bulbs I've tried that are ""normal"" sized, which is the only thing that kept me from just returning the 5-pack despite the size issue. (Yes, 5-pack, since one of my bulbs was DOA. Amazon was nice enough to offer a partial refund for that bulb, which I decided was better than shipping all six bulbs back and forth.) They're also a bit expensive as noted; the price would be more in line if they were actually smaller as claimed.<br /><br />(I did contact Amazon with links to the manufacturer's information in hopes that they fix the description and/or stock actual ""super mini"" bulbs, assuming Earthmate actually makes them in a full-spectrum version! I would love to have this product in a smaller version, if it exists...)<br /><br />Sep 7 edit: Down to 4 working bulbs after having these bulbs in for 4 days. :( The one that just died was in a fixture paired with another of the same... I'm going to give them another couple weeks and see if any more die before I decide whether to return them or have them all replaced. It's possible it was shipping damage since the outer box arrived crushed (though the product box was fine), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Oct 4 edit: I had the bulbs replaced a couple weeks ago. Whoever packed them wasn't too bright, since he or she just stuck a FedEx label on the product box without any extra packaging! Not cool for shipping light bulbs, Amazon. Only 4 bulbs arrived working, certainly due to shipping damage this time. Fortunately Amazon told me to do whatever with the first shipment rather than return it, so I have 8 working bulbs now, which I can't complain about since no more have died since then. (Of course, they're still not ""super mini"" as listed, so my review remains at 2 stars instead of 5.)",2

B004YV80OE,"I thought this would be a nice compromise between what I like for dinner, good chicken and pasta with veggies, and what my son likes, anything resembling macaroni and cheese.  The cheese sauce was creamy with a balanced flavor, but I had to add extra chicken pieces (good thing I was using pre-cooked rotisserie) to get a goood cheese to pasta/chicken ratio.  Without the extra chicken this would have been too cheesy for my taste.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the ""broccoli"" that in the end looked like big parsley flakes rather than broccoli. Although the prep was easy and relatively quick, I was reminded why I like my own quick recipes that allow me to have real vegetables of recognizable pieces and real cheese which I personally prefer to Velveeta.<br /><br />Would not buy again.",2
B005KDJEJK,"I've probably tried about 15 varieties of beans from Rancho Gordo.  They're all excellent.  Some are better suited for one type dish than another, and if you visit their website, they will tell you what works best for which dish.<br /><br />Some are just plain gorgeous to boot!  And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)<br /><br />Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.<br /><br />This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!  It's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products.<br /><br />Oh yeah, sign up for their newsletter too, Steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans.",5

I'm going to actually cook with it before I send it back. Price wise, Walmart wanted $3.78  for .065 ounces...so this is a steal. I'm going to rate it middling till I actually use it. Then I'll rerate it based on flavor, not just dates.<br />On the cooking side of things, poultry seasoning is my secret ingredient in nearly all of my soups.

I was hoping the ""nut"" was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut.

B004ZIER34,"I normally don't choose darker roasts of coffee because I don't like the acid and bitter flavor that is normally associated with them.  This coffee is quite different from a standard dark roast.  It has the smoother flavor of a lighter roast without the acid.<br /><br />I prepare my coffee in a french press with water at a temperature just below boiling, around 175 degrees fahrenheit.  When I poured in the water, I could smell a sort of a burnt aroma as well as a distinctly licorice aroma.  Undaunted, I finished my preparations and added some creamer and a touch of sweetener.  Upon tasting, I detected notes of chocolate and toasted nuts with a slight licorice finish.  Very smooth.  No bitterness or acid.  The burnt aroma didn't go into the flavor.  It just tasted toasty.<br /><br />It was a nice change-up from my usual coffee.  I usually choose light to medium roasts.  I would like to try some of their other offerings.",4
B002LANN56,"We have the pickiest dog on earth.  It took us 3 years to find a food that he would eat a full bowl of on a consistent basis!  When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-)",3

B00513J3GS,"My oldest cat has become very finicky about his food, and I need him to gain some weight, so I decided to try a new food.  Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.<br /><br />If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.

I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum!

B001FSISZK,"these cookies, while admittedly are delicious though I agree with another reviewer that said they are more mint than chocolate, leave me strangely thirsty. the kind of thirst that is annoyingly uncomfortable. Even after only eating a single cookie, 15 minutes later I was so thirsty it was uncomfortable. I discovered they have 160 mg sodium per serving (4 cookies in a serving according to the label). Compare that to a health valley organic chocolate chip granola bar at 15mg of sodium per bar, a whole foods brand 365 organic swiss dark chocolate with mint crisps chocolate bar at 0 mg sodium, 365 brand frosted morning O's with 50mg of sodium, and you can easily see how salty these are. Newman O's mint creme flavor have 2 cookies in a serving (which is actually like 4 cookies with a creme center like an oreo, with only 70mg sodium per serving, less than half. The point is, the sodium isn't just bad if you are on a low sodium diet, but they are bad because they make you very thirsty... uncomfortably thirsty! Too bad, because they are delicious. I won't be buying another box with too many other mint chocolate products on the market that are healthier and don't leave me uncomfortable a few minutes later like eating at a restaurant whose food is delicious on the plate but get home and experience stomach pains, acid reflux, or other discomfort. I have learned that there are many restaurants with delicious food and no discomfort after and the food digests well. Food is more than the moment. It has to also nourish and not make you sick later... These don't make the cut. And its not that I'm weird. I'm a normal 30-something guy with a healthy apetite and discerning palette.

I could not taste any lemon flavor and very little if any honey flavor. The Ginger was almost medicinally strong and somewhat bitter, though it did not sting the throat like fresh ginger does at this intensity, nor did it clear the sinus. I think this is too strongly flavored to accompany most food, though it might go well with some cookies or possibly cheese. I do not know if it would be effective for motion sickness or other nausea and so far as I can tell this is being marketed as a beverage. It is not particularly sweet but also has none of the tartness one expects from lemon. The strength reminded me of  a very strong ginger ale without the fizz.

It's actually not very lemony at all, but instead the sweetness is a bit over-powering for the lemon. I actually had to go back and double check the ingredients because the sweetness almost tastes fake as you are drinking it (like it's a fake sweetener).

B0006ZL2GU,"I bought these as a healthy treat for my new boxer puppy. To begin with, I recieved canidae dog treats .. for senior and over weight. The description of the product does not mention this. My puppy ate the treats fine and seemed to enjoy them, but I found them to be a bit messy. After a treat there would be crumbs all over the floor. Nonetheless, my puppy found them tasty.",2

B007ZQMJA6,"I love yoo-hoo.  it's one of my favorite 'gas station' buys...meaning, i don't buy it from the store, but if i'm going on a trip or something, i'll pick up a yoo-hoo.<br /><br />I was super surprised to find this drink mix.  It was cheap and I thought the kids and i would like making our own yoo-hoo at home.  i was totally disappointed.  it does not taste like yoo-hoo. it tastes nasty.  almost too sweet?  and it doesn't dissolve well in milk.  you can stir and stir, and you still have nasty clumps floating on the top of your milk.<br /><br />i did give it two stars because...well, it's drinkable.  and my kids kind of like it.",2
B0019CSQ36,"I guess I was expecting a more authentic beef jerky but the texture and flavor of this is terrible.

I was very disappointed in this and will never purchase it again.",1
B000CMKPDI,"I'd heard good things about Poop-Freeze from other pet owners, so I ordered a can.  Sadly, I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped to be. I followed the directions the first time, and instead of frozen poop, I just had cooler poop to pick up.  The second time, I sprayed for longer than recommended. This gave me cold, but still not frozen, poop. Granted, if you're picking it up with a plastic baggie, cold poop is slightly more pleasant that still-warm poop, but the product implies that the poop will be frozen nearly solid and that is not the case. (Incidentally, we're talking a pug here, not a really BIG dog).",3
B0034KP00S,"Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top ""dessert almonds"" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",5
B00139TT72,"I like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available. I switched to this when the brand I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my ""chowhound"") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up.",3
B002RU3UNK,"The product I received came in a different package than what is pictured but that is fine because it was a little bigger than what I expected. The oil doesnt really have a smell so that is good because I intend to use it in a mixture of oils for my natural hair. The delivery was fast and even arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date. I've only used it once so far and mixed it 50/50 with Olive Oil as a hot oil treatment, it wasn't greasy at all and left my hair nice and soft. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't had time to use it enough. I will update this review after I have used it for awhile and can make a better assessment.",4
B001ELL4FY,"I like a light strength of coffee and this one said it was light. However, it is more of a medium and stronger than I like.  So, I was a little disappointed since the purchase included 2 boxes. I'll use it because it's a little pricey, but I won't order this brand again.",3

B000FF3L56,"I'm a little disappointed in this gum. The pieces (indivudal ""chiclets"" in a blister pack)  are tiny (expect to pop at least 2) and the flavour blows out pretty quickly. I have been chewing Trident ""mini sticks"" for some time. They too use Xylitol as the sweetener but retain their consistency and flavour for much longer than Xlichew.<br /><br />Even the initial flavour of Xylichew is pretty weak compared to Trident.<br /><br />I likely won't be buying Xylichew again.",2
B004YV80OE,"Don't think of this as a quick meal unless you use leftover chicken or chicken  you  cooked ahead of time.<br /><br />To make this dinner, you will need to purchase 1 lb. of chicken breasts.<br /><br />To add more flavor, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, Mrs. Dash Chicken seasoning & poultry seasoning while I was cooking it then followed the instructions on the box. If you're not familiar with orzo pasta which is the pasta used in this meal, it looks similar to white rice.  The broccoli used  is dried florets. The pieces are tiny & because it's dried they have the color of dried parsley. There isn't much broccoli included so I added more.<br /><br />My family thought the meal was okay; some thought it didn't have enough flavor, some thought the pasta was too soft (maybe I overcooked it); I thought it was salty which is typical of box meal kits.

B005GGV19C,"I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE (""Movie Size"" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8-10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air-filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy - But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles-urge overtake me yet again.",2

B0045XE32E,My terrier mutt Ray loves these.  I haven't tasted them myself so I can't comment on the taste.  They are very hard which Ray loves.  My only complaint is that I wish they were either smaller or scored so I could break them in half.  They are too hard and thick to break in my hand...<br /><br />I love that these do not smell and seem just as good to ray when I have left the bag open... he doesn't complain of them being stale.,4
B001ELL86Y,"I just want to chime in with the other reviewers who noted the poor quality of these k-cups. Half of the k-cups I purchased explode in my coffee machine because the foil over the top of the cup is not sealed properly. Not only is it disappointing and a waste of money, it's a real pain to clean your machine after an explosion of coffee grounds. This is unfortunate because I think Tully's has the best quality coffee, particularly decaf, you can find out there in k-cups right now. I heard Starbucks is going to get in the k-cup business at some point. Hopefully sooner than later.",1

B004ZIER34,"I usually drink decaf, for health reasons.  I found this coffee to have a robust flavor without being bitter.  I prefer my coffee to taste as close to coffee ice cream as possible; this coffee came pretty close to my ideal once I added cream and (fake) sugar.  My friend, who drinks it black, also liked it very much.  No stomach issues at all, for either of us.",4

It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better.",5

B001AQVQL0,"If you're loooking for a ready-to-drink shake, try a different brand. Over the course of two months I ordered two 12-packs of the Labrada shake. Delivery was prompt, but in both cases the whey protein and other solids in every carton had separated from the liquid, congealing into a chunk that couldn't be remixed by shaking the container for as long as a minute (as the manufacturer recommends.) In one instance, getting the contents out required slicing open the carton. Once the contents had been put into a blender, the shakes were satisfactory --- creamy. delicious and filling. But not RTD. If you're going to end up using a blender or shake bottle anyway, buy Labrada meal supplements in powdered form to begin with. I've found them equally tasty (although made with sugar,) equally nutritious and you'll be getting what you expected.",1

B000084ETV,"My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />""Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.""<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />""We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.""<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The ""Canidae Team"" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?",1

B00016UX0K,"What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews, soups, etc. It keeps well - the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1, Heinz 57, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, etc as a condiment staple.",5
B002TMV34E,"This coffee has a robust flavor with hints of chocolate undertones and a somewhat earthy nose. It's not bright or winey like Kenya or Columbian coffees, but it's also not as heavy as a Sumatra. Classique is called a medium blend, and it would be a good after-dinner coffee. I drank the coffee by itself, but it would have the body to stand up to a sweet dessert. The mouthfeel was a bit on the heavy side, but the coffee did not leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I think Classique is a little on the heavy side for a breakfast coffee, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. A 5-star coffee would be good to drink at any time.",4

B005K4Q1VI,"To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad.",4

B0041NYV8E,"I am always a little cautious with beverage mixes so I used half a packet in the recommended 1 cup of hot water (50% recommended strength)<br /><br />It was so extremely ginger bitter that I couldn't take it.  So I added another cup of hot water.  I managed to keep drinking it but only about half way (this is at 25% strength).  I ended up just dumping it.<br /><br />I haven't drank any more - if you like chewing pickled ginger or something like that maybe you'll like this but it is NOT like ginger tea - it's not subtle and it's extremely bitter.  Could smell the lemon - could only taste ginger.<br /><br />Not at all for me.  I'll try to pawn off what I have left on someone else but my boyfriend won't take it either.  He tasted a sip of mine said ""it's okay"" and then refused to drink any more, so I'll assume that regardless of what he said, he doesn't like it either.",1

B003LECIDE,"I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MO765O"">EZ-Sweetz 2-ounce bottle)</a>, and I loved the convenience and carb savings over Splenda.  But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I'm down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I've always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven't noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).  But still, it's such a huge savings of carbs (and even calories), it's a good product to get.<br /><br />Update 8/27/12 - The first several packages I got were very easy to dispense.  However, the past two packages I've purchased have required a much tighter squeeze to get them to drip.  If you only need one or two drops, it's not a big deal.  But when you're counting out 30 for a big pitcher of lemonade, it becomes downright *painful*.  I thought the first batch was a fluke (though it was all three bottles).  But now this batch (ordered more than a month later) is just as bad.  I've dropped my star rating as a result, and I'll be looking for different product to switch to.",3
B0078Q9RD0,"I occasionally grab a few pantry goods from Amazon when they're good deals, so at some point, I grabbed this big pack of (supposed) albacore tuna.<br /><br />Well, it didn't go well.<br /><br />The cans arrived incredibly dented, which made me wonder if they were castoffs or remaindered cans that couldn't be sold in other ways due to the quality of the cans.<br /><br />The tuna itself was really strange.  Look, I've bought Bumblebee tuna before and don't remember it being this bad. But this, which is supposed to be white albacore in water, is just the worst quality of tuna I have ever bought. The tuna doesn't look like white albacore at all, but more like the regular, flaky, grainy, browner textured regular tuna.  There is none of the pale, steak-like, albacore consistency in the tuna in these cans at all.<br /><br />It is literally the worst quality of albacore tuna I can ever remember buying.<br /><br />(Meanwhile, if you care about quality, I would suggest the Sustainable Seas albacore as an alternative. It's not much more expensive and the quality is terrific. We bought that shortly after this, and were blown away by how good it was.

B001UOJGNM,"My bottle arrived early and I was very excited to have found a good moisturizer. My bottle says organic coconut oil, buy it's advertised as 'virgin' coconut oil. I tried doing a little research, and couldn't tell if there is a difference between virgin coconut oil and organic coconut oil. The oil does keep my skin hydrated, but it is greasy and I use it in small amounts. I mix a small amount with my regular lotion so it will absorb in my skin better. If I don't mix it, it takes a long time for my skin to absorb the oil. I'm guessing this will be perfect for the winter, so I'm looking forward to using it then. I read that coconut oil is supposed to help with eczema, but it doesn't do a lot for mine. It does help with the itching (I can go 5-8 hours without itching), but the rash hasn't gone away. I had better results from a natural oil mixture that I buy at the drug store. I don't like that I have to mix the oil with my regular lotion (I was hoping to replace my lotion altogether), but it keeps my skin hydrated better than my lotion alone or other products I've used alone.

B00503DP0O,"I should point out from the get-go that to the best of my knowledge, I don't suffer from any sort of celiac sensitivity in the slightest. However, I'm very aware that this is a problem for many people, some of whom are unaware that they have a problem but know they're not functioning as they should. I do know what it's like to be unable to digest food that you like (in my case, any sort of meat) and wheat is even more difficult to avoid, so I can sympathize.<br /><br />Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are meant to provide a tasty, healthful snack for the gluten-intolerant. They're sweetened with agave and the ingredients are palatable to both celiac sufferers and those who just want a snack that's devoid of white sugar. These bars are guaranteed gluten-free, come individually wrapped, and are packed five to the box.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are actually pretty tasty--their lack of ingredients like stevia ensures that they have a pleasant sweetness that's gentle and tastes completely natural. And the other flavors are well-balanced as well--there are plenty of chocolate chips of good quality and the presence of coconut is a plus. But the fact of the matter is that Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars suffer from a fault that's pretty consistent in individually wrapped desserts of this kind: they're just too damp and lacking in crispness. Yes, I know that we all want chewy cookies nowadays and that cookie dough is held to be a gastronomic pinnacle to some. But I prefer my ""soft"" tempered by some external ""snap,"" so this isn't the ideal snack for me. It tastes nice but the texture, for me, falls short (your own mileage may vary).<br /><br />Regardless of my personal quirks, the fact that the food industry is accommodating those with food sensitivities and doing their best to do so in such a way as to use quality ingredients is fantastic. For those who like a damp, moist cookie, these just might be your idea of heaven--gluten-intolerant or not. Not my first choice for a nosh but this, I reiterate, is a purely personal call.",4

B002DHTWNO,"I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.",2

As I reached set out, a rotten food smell became worse. Cut off plastic wrap and a corner of this can box was wet and slimy. Opening the 12 pack, sickening smell! 12 cans into sink to wash off. One can CHICKEN, in a box, the metal top was open, pushed into the can, and where wet, damp, stinky, rotten smell came from - Tossed the one can not usable! After rinsing, reached 2nd box - also damp, wash cans also search for another broken can.

B002NHYQAS,"The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar offers a 2.25 ounces of smooth but unimpressive dark chocolate flavor.  It's of medium taste quality, in my opinion, like it's missing something.<br /><br />Packaged in a small brown and black wrapper, this candy bar is created using 54% cocoa, which has proven to be beneficial for cardiovascular well-being, reducing your risks of blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.  On the downside, this bar contains 330 calories, which compared to a regular candy bar without healthy cocoa ingredients, is a high fat content.  When compared to other bars packed with healthier cocoa, the Newman's Own Organics dark chocolate bar does compare in that regard.<br /><br />Newman's Own gives all of it's profits to charity, and the company motto is ""Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good.""  They are a company that does the right thing and sets the standard by which other companies should follow.<br /><br />Just for the chocolate, I'd probably pass.  But if I have to have chocolate, and I do have to have it, I'd choose Newman's Own Organics over another brand that doesn't use good business practices and donate their profits to charity; right up there with supporting mom and pop stores and shopping local grocers instead of buying at the nearest big-box super center.<br /><br />So it's not just a chocolate bar.

B0016FY6H6,"I bought this ""flavor"" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3.

There is just no excuse for some of these being less than half the size of others in the same bag. I paid for a bag of large chews and I expect large chews. Apparently no quality control exists or it doesn't matter to the company what size chew goes in what size bag.,3

B001LG945O,"As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ"">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y"">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon.",4

B0001BVD04,"""Boylan Bottleworks""<br /><br />AS a charter member of ""Free Associators Anonymous,"" the company name is ripe with conotation: Pittsburgh. Giant pipes of metal and glass with sweaty workers downing a ""Boylans"" (or, shorter, sweeter: ""Hey, Trow Me a 'Boys'!""  Ironworks, manholes made in Oakland, tough immigrants, and cherries blacker than coal. Coupled with The Bottle Americana, even a non-serious soda flavor like cherry has a certain gravitas, a don't-screw-with-me style, even though I'm rich enough to afford this.<br /><br />Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.<br /><br />Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude.",4
B005K4Q1VI,"I ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my Keurig, and I am very happy with this product. I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!",4
B000M5QO30,"As Chef Tom says, 'Don't be afraid of curry!'.  There's a light but distinct curry scent to this mix that works beautifully on shrimp, scallops, and white fish (catfish, orange roughy, red snapper).<br /><br />For those of you who who don't like the 'burn' curries can impart, no worries - the bark is definitely stronger than the bite in this case. It fades to practically non-existence on more distinctly flavorful 'red' fish such as salmon and tuna.  It's too weak for pork, let alone beef. (To be fair though, it wasn't really designed for these types of meat).<br /><br />This spice isn't quite as good as the two knockouts in Chef Tom's collection: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>  - but it is yummy.

I tuned my Vario grinder to ensure the correct grind for this new bean.  I pulled a shot of espresso (I have an Andreja Premium from QuickMill)... Horrible.  I adjusted the grind three more times with as many shots.  The shots were consistently watery, bitter, and, quite frankly, embarrassing.  DO NOT purchase this product.  I will use these beans to pull throw-away shots after cleaning my grinder and espresso machine... that's all they are good for.",1
B004PXEZAE,"I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns, whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences, I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn), even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.<br /><br />First impression: Packaging looks great and the illustration on the box lures you to try it at once as soon as you look at the box.<br /><br />Cooking: I used my Sharp microwave 1200 W, 1.2 cubic feet of sheer raw cooking power. Even though my microwave has sensor based cooking feature for popcorn and other food items, I set the microwave timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds, so as to not leave anything to chance. Instructions on the pack are very clear about up & down side markings, cooking time, handling instructions etc. After cooking for 2 & 1/2 minutes, I carefully removed the popcorn bowl (as it miraculously transforms itself into).<br />Now comes the little tricky part. Instruction on the bowl clearly indicates how to handle the bowl and how to remove the top plastic off the bowl, so as to dig in and help yourself with the buttery popcorn. So I tried opening the bowl by pulling the plastic from one side, but to no avail. So I tried the other side with more frustration and no better result. I contemplated using a scissor to cut the plastic open, but then I would have to clean the scissor, since all the residual butter would be transferred to the scissor creating a mess. I was surprised that all this hype and commercial about bowl popcorn really amounts to such bad packaging. Then, I forcefully pried open the plastic and got hot residual vapors on my fingers. Boy, what a scalding experience it was!! But I endured the agony so as to try this new popcorn.<br /><br />Taste: Popcorn kernels were large and uniform, and so were popped popcorn. It smelled very buttery, very aromatic indeed. They were crunchy, buttery and crisp. However, I could not have distinguished this final product from the regular Orville Redenbacher popcorns from regular paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this product tastes the same as regular same brand paper bag product, why am I spending 3 times more money to buy this item? So that I could just eat from a bowl instead of a paper bag? Now I am not a dodo and neither are regular Amazon customers looking for a better bang for their buck, so then what on the earth would make one shell out more money? I am amazed at the marketing department at work here. Do they really think that giving people bowl instead of a paper bag would somehow cast a Harry Potter like spell on us and force us to buy this product on a regular basis? Well guess again marketing guys, as far as I am concerned, No Popcorn Bowl for me. If you like the idea of eating your popcorn from a paper bowl, and if you are willing to put up with the inconvenience and mess and higher price, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Clear instructions<br />2) Tempting packaging<br />3) Giant uniform popcorn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) EXPENSIVE<br />2) No easy way to tear apart the plastic top off the final popcorn bowl<br />3) Did I mention EXPENSIVE",2

The kit is easy to prepare--brown the meat, add the seasoning and pasta, simmer, and stir in cheese packet--and cooking takes less than half an hour. It is tasty but a bit salty, and there is not much pasta.

B001BDDTB2,"I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually ""sesame"". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese ""Sesame"" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor, multi-pack design.",3

B0061IUKDM,"I drink tea frequently and obsessively. At a minimum I drink 3 cups of tea per day and I prefer loose leaf tea over tea bags. In the mornings I opt for tea bags for efficiency and time. My morning teas alternate between Green Tea, English Breakfast, Earl Grey and Black Tea. As such, I am always tasting and trying new teas, especially the green tea variety. When I saw this tea offered, I jumped at the chance to get Higgins. But, I was highly disappointed.<br /><br />First, the taste is rather bland and weak. There is barely any flavor. I had a cup of tea whilst taking to a friend and during our conversation I noticed that I had finished the tea but had no memory of its flavors or qualities. I had no idea what I had drunk! It was the equivalent of drinking water. The only thing that comes across is hot water and some lemongrass flavor (see below re lemongrass). None of the green tea leaves flavor comes out. I opened up a tea bag and noticed that the leaves mix is rather powdery (no wonder there is barely any taste).<br /><br />Several reviewers (and the description) have mentioned that this tea has a lemon grass taste. Lemon grass is not something I use a lot but, thankfully, I had some lemon grass in my pantry. I tried it and ...the reviewers are very right. This tea has some lemon grass undertones.<br /><br />If you are looking for an very affordable and good tasting tea (in tea bag form), try Stash or even Lipton Pyramid Tea Bags. Something other than this.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pass. Money is better spent at better tea brands.",2

B009GHI6I6,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

It tastes good, but seems almost unnecessary.<br /><br />One use that seems to work pretty well is adding it to a taco salad.  It's kind of a nice addition to keep the flavors a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that.  It could also add a bit of variety to sandwiches if one is in the mood for something a little different than the norm; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar.  I might also try it for dipping chicken nuggets or wings, etc.<br /><br />Overall it seems like a pretty good product, but not something I'd be likely to use daily or even a couple times a week, so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably won't buy a 6-pack of them.  I would rate it perhaps 4 stars on taste but it loses a few points for versatility since it's not really hot sauce, taco sauce, salsa, sandwich spread, or salad dressing, it's kind of something else that I have trouble classifying.",3

B004OV6X6Q,"Disclaimer: A free sample of these bars were received from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The Pure Natural bars are gluten free protein snack bars. I sampled the Chocolate Almond flavor. I did not really care for the first bar but have since eaten a couple more and have raised my opinion to ""okay."" I don't eat protein bars generally, finding the ones that taste decent to be high in carbs or sugar or both-- if I'm going to eat something with that much carb or sugar I might as well ""sin lustfully"" and grab a Hershey bar.<br /><br />That being said, these bars are chewy with a fruity flavor. They do not taste very chocolatey, nor can you really taste, or even find, the almonds. However, they also do not have a strong bran or ""dog food"" taste as I find with many other protein bars.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy these on my own, and I'm not even sure if I will finish the package, but if you have gluten problems and you like protein bars, you may find you like these.",3

I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally.

A bag of Iam's this size would cost only  $7.29.<br />I don't like soy nor do I like gluten which this contains and it also has added dyes.  Iam's has no artificial preservatives and has enough vitamins and minerals to actually list them in the Guaranteed Analysis list.  I feel the vitamins and minerals are important.  Chef's Michael's says it has 23 essential vitamins and minerals in there somewhere but not enough to list, I guess.<br />Chef Michael's contains green beans and potatoes and Iam's has tomatoes, peas, brewer's yeast, flax meal, dried apple pomace and spinach and whole grain sorghum and barley, although I don't like grains either.

B001TJYTG2,"I was excited when I saw the picture of this plant and the price.  Even with shipping being a lot more than the cost of the plant itself, the overall price I thought was still a steal.  Then the plant showed up today.  Yes, it's the same kind of plant but it looks like a little baby version.  Nowhere near as big and full as the picture.  It's EXTREMELY misleading.  I would have given this one star for being so misleading instead of two, but if I hold onto the plant long enough and take care of it, someday it may look o.k.  It's a nice plant for $4.95, but I would not have paid this plus shipping to get a plant this small if I had known.<br /><br />Update - I reread the information in the plant description, and it does say the plant delivered is not pictured, so I apparantly missed that.

B0009XTVKS,"I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these ""gourmet"" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag ""not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product""-""made in China"" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering.",1

Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.

I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.

That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off.

B001P3NU30,"I have a 1 year old lab/Shepard mix and she is a very active chewer.  I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds, 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.<br /><br />Edit -<br /><br />My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of ""is this useful votes"" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.  I hope this isn't the case because they would be toying with the danger of killing our dogs.",1

B0030GOO5S,"I'm a confirmed hot chocolate snob and yes, I admit I only really wanted a Keurig to make a really quick, banging cup of hot chocolate (and maybe not be on a first name basis with every employee at Dunkin Donuts).  In fact, I don't even drink coffee, so the quest for the perfect hot chocolate for the Keurig is not one I take lightly.<br /><br />Of the brands of hot chocolate I've tried that are made specifically for the Keurig, this one is the best.<br /><br />I tried a couple of brews before I reviewed this...  So here's the conclusion that I've come to:<br /><br />I have a Keurig Special Edition B60 brewer, and the first brew I did as was suggested by the maker (shake the K-Cup before brewing, brew on 8oz setting).  Of course my brewer doesn't have 8oz, so I brewed at 7.25oz, the ""middle button.""  The result was a watery cup of hot chocolate with a fair amount of chocolate flavor, but still a little too watered down for me.  The color was really good, rich, dark, and even had some of that nice foamy goodness on the top.  I was *very* happy to see when I looked at the empty K-Cup after brewing that there was almost no powder or residue left in the K-Cup, a problem that the other hot chocolate K-Cups really suffer from no matter how hard you shake them and there was almost no thick chocolate gunk at the bottom of the mug when finished.  Awesome.  So overall, when brewed as suggested, it was the best hot chocolate I've tried for the K-Cup when prepared as-is, but not the best cup of homemade hot chocolate possible.<br /><br />The next brew I did I shook the K-Cup and brewed on the small cup setting, the 5.25oz brew.  The result was a hot chocolate that was a little thicker, beautiful color, lots of that spectacular white foam on top, something that looked like a REAL hot chocolate.  The flavor was much more defined, a lot more chocolaty, and very smooth and tasty.  Though I did notice that slightly Splenda-like aftertaste which kind of surprised me since I'm largely desensitized to that taste (thank you Fruit2O) and honestly it was ever-so-slightly just too sweet.  But wow was it good.  Still not the best hot chocolate to make at home, but really good.<br /><br />Third brew I did I did again on the 5.25oz brew, put a splash of half-and-half in the cup, then brewed.  Holy cow in a hat...  That was awesome.  Finally a substitute for my Dunkin Donuts trips.  So, so, so good.  No aftertaste, right amount of sweetness and creamy texture.  Great, rich color that looks like a melted Hershey Bar.  Right up there with the best hot chocolate one can make at home for sure.  For sure a taste that competes with hot chocolate I've tried from Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />So rating this for me was hard...  When made, straight up as suggested, it's OK and even when it's made with less water it's pretty good.  Since I think the Keurig is designed for speedy ease-of-use, I think a lot of people are looking for and expecting that great cup of hot chocolate right out of the box.  In that way, it delivers an OK product, the best K-Cup hot chocolate available now, but not an overall great cup of hot chocolate.  But if you're willing to put two seconds worth of time into making it positively delicious, you will be very richly rewarded with fantastic hot chocolate.<br /><br />I fluctuated between rating 3 stars because, out of the box, it's only OK, and 4 stars because when adjusted it's amazing...  I ended up going 4 star with the assumption that there are a lot of people out there with a Keurig who do coffee or tea where they add creamer and/or sugar to adjust it to their taste, and I see doing this as much the same sort of thing.<br /><br />Hopefully Keurig will put out a hot chocolate soon that's amazing right out of the box.  If we could get them to talk to the Land O Lakes folks (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M5RNTS"">Cocoa Classics Hot Cocoa Drink Mix 7 Variety Pack</a>), there would never be a reason to leave the house for hot chocolate again...",4

On the other hand, it took lots of attention.<br /><br />So, as a compromise, I sometimes go to these packaged products.  Concord Foods makes a useable hollandaise sauce. The key advantage is ease of preparation. The cost? It's not as rich a taste as when I make my own. So, it's a tradeoff.

So I looked them up on Amazon and ordered me a cinnamon walnut coffee cake from Fantasicakes...one word: AMAZING. One of my motivations of ordering it over Boston Coffee Cake is i noticed pound for pound they're cheaper. I'm glad I did. Either one is better then My Grandma's coffee cake honestly. If you think this is good, i recommend trying Fantasicakes or Boston coffee cake. And another thing about My Grandma's coffee cake is it doesn't have enough walnuts in the middle.

Why change a product that was getting great reviews and selling well?<br /><br />Maybe to save money? Either way, don't buy this because Amazon will ship you the ""NEW"" version, which doesn't taste anything like the version we liked before Novemeber / December 2011. Unfortunately, these are also disappearing off grocery shelves, being replaced by the ""NOW EVEN BETTER!"" labaled cans.<br /><br />Also, Amazon will not let you return these, by default. I'm in the process of requesting an exception, since they sent soemthing other than what is listed, here.<br /><br />__ Don't buy this.

Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste brown sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all.

""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness?

I like fizzy waters, I like fizzy juices.  This was flavorsome and fizzy, fruity and yummy.  My son wanted a taste and ended up stealing the remaining contents from me, much to my dismay.<br /><br />The cons of this refreshing beverage are its contents.  At just a little over 8 ounces (a Cup) this drink contains 130 calories, 33 grams of sugar, 35 grams of Carbohydrates, and 15 mg of sodium.  Whoa, Baby!  That's an awful lot packed into a little container.  I am by no means a health nut but I read labels and try to eat decent 90% of the time.  This drink is absolutely delicious, but it contains an awful lot of things that aren't friendly to my physique.

The chocolate has soymilk powder, and we try to keep soy consumption low (the berry version doesn't). I didn't really like the taste of the chocolate when simply added to water, it needed more. In general, we liked the flavor of the berry a bit better, and the berry version has both prebiotics and probiotics in the ingredients, but the chocolate doesn't.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you or your child is a chocolate fan, you really can't go wrong with this awesome superfood mix!",4

That, coupled with her highly food driven motivation, usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly. This is the only item I've ever purchased that she can't manipulate well. Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible. Regardless of the number of dogs in your household, this is one toy I'd pass on.<br /><br />Update: My medium chewer has now completely chewed apart the rubber pull rope with this.

There is also an abundance of Vitamin C.<br /><br />But for health watches note it still packs a modest wallop of calories (135 cal) from its 33g of sugars, albeit natural-not bad, but if you are on a calorie restricted diet or in physical training, you will want to watch it. If you sit back and pop these all day you will still get fat. But this would be a great drink for active folks.

On to the lovin' spoonful, then.<br /><br />Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is a sweet, corn-based cereal without any particularly notable taste. It's like eating a somewhat bland caramel corn or candy coated peanut cereal with milk. The honey is not very noticeable; the overall flavor is kind of bland. The good points are that it doesn't get soggy quickly and at 100 cal (minus milk) per serving, is pretty decent in the calorie department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the lack of flavor here makes Crunchy Nut more like Crunchy Not.

You can definitely taste the ginger, but it's offset by the lemon and honey blend.  Although ginger, lemon and honey are considered healthy ingredients and may have medicinal qualities, this is not a diet drink.  According to the label, there are 73 calories per serving, so please keep this in mind.  However, it is caffeine free, so it would make an ideal evening drink alone or with a dash of milk.  My only concern is the price, which I believe is a little steep.",4

The roller ball is very firmly fitted into the top so that it doesn't really roll.  It's mostly stuck in one position unless I manipulate it with my fingers (which are then covered in a strongly-smelling liquid that is difficult to wash off).  My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this ""treat"", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution.",3

B004YV80O4,"Brown up some hamburger, add the noodles, water, and the seasoning packet.  Cook it up til the water is gone, stir in the cheesy glop and its ready to eat!!<br />Flavor:  amazingly, the seasoning packet adds the flavor of hamburger additives (pickle, mustard, onions, very weird). The cheese packet adds the usual sort of cheese like flavor of velveeta. Overall, pretty bland and very salty.<br />Texture:  noodle mushiness is controlled by how much water you add and how long you let it cook.  Feels like you would expect.<br />Ease of use: A+ .<br />Overall value:  its fairly inexpensive and I suppose wouldn't be a terrible thing to have in the cupboard for those desperate nights when the kids are starving.<br />In reality, since you have to brown the hamburger, the time factor is a little more than I'd like for something that tastes this mediocre.  In the same amount of time or less there are many tastier healthier options for your family.  But compared to other meals of this type, this one is a middle of the roader. If your kids have a thing for the taste/feel of melty Velveeta, this might be the quickie meal for you.",2
B00020HHRW,"I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!",4

It would improve this product so greatly.<br /><br />They are thieves nonetheless, you usually get 10 envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks, buy two for less than ten, and still be spending less than what I spent with these.

B003UDV9SG,"I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.

This is very disappointing considering 4-5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.<br /><br />It is very surprising why this product got around 4/5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text ""Made in China"" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.<br /><br />We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes.

B004ZIER34,"I'm such a coffee snob that I source from specific farmers in Ethiopia. I say this so that people will understand I don't drink grocery store coffee.<br /><br />This Puroast low acid stuff? Flavorless. No body. No ""coffee-ness"" to it. It tasted like vaguely coffee-flavored water. It's caffeinated, so it's got that going for it. I'd rather take 50 Tums and drink good coffee though.",2
B001E5DZTS,"We started with fresh goats milk and after 2 weeks transitioned to this product.  I prepare it with warm water in the blender and add some strawberry flavoring.  My son (17 months) loves it.  Very easy to prepare, and compared to baby formula - VERY reasonable in price.",5

B001OCKIP0,"When I saw all those chocolate chunks in Back To Natures Granola I got a little too excited.  I love me some chocolate and when it is in granola I can only imagine the orgasmic experience in my mouth.  I am sad to report that no orgasmic experience was to be had.  Upon first bite I noticed a great crunch but the flavor of the granola by itself almost had a raw taste to it, like a raw flour/oat taste and it was very off putting. Not at all sweet and that could be a plus for someone who is trying to not eat too much sugar but I need my granola to have some sort of sweetness to it which this granola did not have.  I had some of the chocolate in the mix and that by itself was very delicious but not worth the cost of the granola, will just get a chocolate bar.  I much prefer the Love Crunch Granola By Natures Path, that is absolutly scrumptious and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor and pieces along with freeze dried berries, plus it is all organic.  So if you are looking for a nice flavorful granola that has nice chocolate goodness look elsewhere because you will not get that with this granola.",2

B001LG945O,"The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce can packs a big punch in a teeny tiny can. Touted as a healthy alternative to soda, I couldn't help but taste the similarity between Switch and Coke's Fanta orange drink. The difference however is more than plain. Switch is supposedly 100% carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars. It actually has a pretty good taste -- if it is all natural, then I think kids would love it. I liked the carbonation -- it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it. All in all, I would buy this product again.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine",4

I found the flavors--both the tea flavor and the fruit flavors--to be a little on the mild side for my taste, even when seeping the tea for significantly longer than the instructions recommend.  So if you prefer bold flavors, I would suggest you look elsewhere.  But if you prefer lighter, milder flavors, this is a very pleasant product.",4
B000NY8OLK,"I have been buying Lindt 70% Cocoa bars for over a decade.  It was the best dark chocolate for the price.  However, the new recipe, as of Fall 2010, lacks the full rich flavor of the original recipe.  It is now bland and too sweet and definitely not work the price any longer.  I bought one bar of the new recipe and won't be buying any more.  I will probably start buying Green & Black's 70% Cocoa bar instead, unless I can find another better 70% cocoa chocolate that costs less than $3 or $4 per bar.",2

B001LG940E,"First of all, this product claims to be ""Black Cherry"" flavor.  Yes, it is made from 100% juice, but cherry juice is well down the list of ingredients.  The drink has mostly apple and grape juice, and that is what I tasted more than anything else.  There is just enough cherry juice in there to give it a hint of cherry behind the apple and grape flavors.  For a cherry lover like myself, this drink was a disappointment.  Further, I think this drink is tremendously overpriced, considering it is just a little over 8 ounces of mostly apple and grape juice with some carbonation added.  If you can do without the carbonation, buy yourself some apple juice or grape juice.  It is much cheaper ounce per ounce.  You may not look as hip as you will look with this fancy can, but it is no longer fashionable to waste money anyway.",1

Maybe if they dialed the sweetness back it would be OK. But as is, I tossed most of this down my kitchen sink and that's a cardinal sin in my house.",1

B001D630KW,"I think what is missing is the ""pumpkin"" flavor.  With this in mind, if I read the flavor name again, it is ""Pumpkin Spice"" not ""Pumpkin AND Spice"".  This is a lot of money to just pour down the drain.  I intend to do some experiments using pumpkin to see what I can yield.  Someone who has used this before MUST have a good recipe to share....  If I find anything, I will post it.<br /><br />As for the starbucks pumpkin spice latte, they use a ""Sauce"".  The ingredients of which are unknown.<br /><br />The closest recipe I have found (per the claim of the recipe, anyways), is this: [...]<br /><br />It appears that there is much effort to duplicate this seasonal Starbucks favorite, as any modest internet search will reveal.  Each recipe seems to be wildly different, several claim to be the exact copy of the Starbucks version of this seasonal favorite.  The recipe above actually calls for this Torani pumpkin spice syrup.  However, I am not sure that the author of the recipe actually tried the syrup themselves.  My first attempt was to follow the recipe exactly, using 2 shots of espresso.  WAYYYYYY too sweet. Several reviewers of this recipe do point out the fact that following the recipe would cost nearly as much as the starbucks version with questionable results.<br /><br />I have experimented with several different variations of the recipe and achieved something that is at least drinkable by using:<br /><br />2 Shots espresso (I use Lavazza Crema e Aroma, found on Amazon in 2.2lb bags)<br />2 pumps vanilla (I substituted vanilla syrup for vanilla extract as called for in the recipe)<br />3 pumps pumpkin spice syrup<br />copious amounts of powdered pumpkin pie spice (To taste)<br />Frothed milk (heated to ~180deg F)<br /><br />Combine all ingredients to fill a 20 oz cup.  Used frothed milk as a topping or whipped cream.<br />This is the ""Drinkable"" combination I have found.  The ""pumpkin"" flavor still seems to be missing, and it certainly isn't close to Starbucks.<br /><br />I hope to find the time to create my own ""sauce"" using the torani syrup, vanilla syrup (from starbucks), pumpkin pie spice (powdered), canned pumpkin puree.  The recipe posted above also states to use canned pumpkin.  My fear is that I will end up gulping down chunks of pumpkin puree :p - I don't see how the pumpkin puree will dissolve gracefully into the coffee.  Also, I have an espresso maker.  The recipe calls for ""strong coffee"" as most people don't have access to their own Super Automatic espresso maker.  I would rather find a recipe that stays true to a real latte, and which does not attempt to ""hack"" day old coffee in a stove top pot.<br /><br />As for my rating, I will give it a ""neutral"" 3 stars for now, as I do not believe the poor result is necessarily the fault of the syrup itself.  I believe the syrup is intended to be 1 part of a recipe, not a complete solution to a specific drink.  If I find a good recipe the uses the syrup, I will adjust my rating accordingly.<br /><br />As for me, I took this on more as an ""adventure"" to see what I could come up with.  I am not using Starbucks espresso, so I know my result will never be the same.  I do like the Starbucks version.  If you are trying to save money, you will likely be disappointed.  Enjoy the occasional Starbucks Pumpkin Latte while it is in season, in moderation, as a seasonal ""pick me up"".  It's not intended to be an every day thing.  Realize that there is no discernable pumpkin flavor in this, and maybe you will look at how you can use it differently.",3

B002TMV34E,"Melitta does a good job with this medium-roast coffee.  If you need coffee for the office where you can't grind fresh, this is better than supermarket coffee (that often includes cheaper Robusta beans) by a long shot  Brew it a bit stronger than recommended to get a full taste.  You can't get it to taste like dark roast by making it stronger - that just makes coffee bitter.  If you want dark roast, buy dark roast.  Medium roast offers pleasures of its own, and can let the individual qualities of coffee come through nicely.<br /><br />Fine grind coffee is meant to made in a filter cone, and this stuff is pleasant and smooth with some personality when done that way.  So if you're looking for a  convenient ground medium-roast blend for weekday mornings and don't want to go through the hassle of picking out some fancy coffee and grinding it at the store, this is a good reliable solution.  Melitta has a good reputation for a reason.<br /><br />Oh, and it is Kosher, too.",4

B0030VBRIU,"My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!",3
B002LANN56,"Like many folks here, I, too, got a sample 4.5 pound bag of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I've always thought that dogs must get tired of the same old foods, and I try to mix up what we feed ours. So I have been adding a handful of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to augment their daily rations of Nutramax or Iams, and the dogs like this stuff. I cannot see any harm to offering some variety, especially when one considers that this species will happily snack on found foods such as road kill, sacks of fast food remnants, and whatever one leaves within reach on the counters when possible.<br /><br />I do think it is quite silly for Purina to blather on about crafting recipes and claim that they have the key to what dogs love to see, smell, or taste. The needless addition of food dyes to this food ticks me off, proving that Purina is pandering to people, not pooches.<br /><br />And the marketing hyperbole ""All thoughtfully prepared, so it can be thoughtfully served"" is nearly enough to send me into a fit of laughter as I thoughtfully grab a handful and throw in with the rest of the dogs' food before adding a bit of cheese, leftover chicken, or even pasta to the mix.<br /><br />I think this food is a good mixer, but I will not use it as the primary food for my dogs. Purina, get rid of some of the fillers and dyes, and I will give you another star in my rating. As is, this stuff is OK as a flavor enhancer, and I will likely buy a bag of it whenever I find it on sale.  (Hasn't the cost of dog food gotten totally out of hand recently? In part, I suspect, this gouging is because of the money spent devising silly descriptions for the foods such as Purina's efforts for this product.)",3
B002LSI1SC,"I guess my cat is not into fish but rather chicken and beef, when I opened the bag and put some on the floor, he just sniffed it and looked up at me as if to say ""what is this?"" and walked away no doubt disapointed, now I have no choice but to throw the whole bag away because he won't eat it, next time I'll just stick to Temptations treats, he loves those.",1
B002QWP89S,"I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.  I removed other items from their diet to be sure and it did it again, instantly. I contacted the company about it and they have claimed no other problems exist(suggesting I must have tainted the product or have exposed it to an environment making the dog snacks unstable, or the company I purchased them from somehow did something to the product. Hmm: sounds troubling to me, especially from the factory.). I have seen other issues out there regarding this product, which vary.  Use your own methods of making a control group, but be sure to see they have proper bowel movements and are not vomiting after you feed them the product.  Secondly, Greenies.com(the Nutro Company) will not honor purchases made through unauthorized vendors.  Amazon directly is an ""authorized vendor"".  ""Monster Pets"" is not authorized to resell these items and only those vendors listed on their website are ""authorized"".  They will only help you return/refund something if it was purchased through an ""authorized"" vendor.

My pods were ""Exotic Floral and Berry"" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.

B004CYLW7A,"Seriously, how do you review a cereal? Let me take a swing at it.<br /><br />Essentially, these are Honey Nut Cheerios with a little added crunch from nut like pieces (not sure if they are real nut pieces as they do not quite have the appropriate texture) adhered to the corn/oat meal donuts. They stay crunchy in milk longer than Cheerios but the flavor seems about the same. As far as nutrition, this is a sweetened cereal with all of the added RDA of vitamins and minerals associated with breakfast cereals. I find nothing disagreeable about this cereal, but the crunchiness brings to mind the 'non-nutritive coating' of Chevy Chase from Christmas Vacation.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is all about the flavor of the cereal and whether it appeals to you, as most cereals of this sort are comparable. Try it, if you like it buy more, if not go back to your other favorites. P-)",4
